Let us not forget that it was only in 1980, I think, that we decriminalised homosexuality in this country. That is not that long ago.</p><p>I want to see the kind of society that has said at a top level, &#8220;We&#8217;re creating equality by allowing same-sex marriage,&#8221; and in which people such as my great-uncle do not have to run down to London and live apart from their family, as my great-uncle had to do so that he could live with someone he loved. There was also my uncle, who had an absolutely rotten childhood, adolescence and adulthood, very much based on his psyche and his having to live a life that was a pretence. Members will notice that I am not saying their names. That is because there are still people out there to whom that would be a bit of a revelation. I respect the memory of both men; they hid what they were for very valid reasons.</p><p>I also want to live in a society in which actors do not have to portray in real life the characters that they portray on screen. Yes, we have come a long way on that but there is still a bit of discrimination going on in that area.</p><p>I want to live&#8212;and represent the constituency of East Kilbride&#8212;in a country in which I do not have the occasional young person coming to me and saying, &#8220;I have to admit to everyone that I am gay,&#8221; or &#8220;I have to admit to everyone that I am bisexual,&#8221; and asking, &#8220;Do you know anyone who will support me or help me?&#8221; I do not want people to have to admit to anything. I want people to just be people and to be the way that they are, and I want everyone to be treated equally in the eyes of the law.</p><p>To go back to the earlier discussion about civil marriage, religious marriage and civil partnerships, everyone should be equal and have equal chances and equal opportunities. My colleague Stewart Maxwell was quite right about that. The reality is that we have civil partnerships now&#8212;they are there. There should be equality for anyone who wants to take part in any of those options.</p><p>I am not married&#8212;I have chosen not to be married. Duncan may have something to do with that as well, right enough, so we have chosen not to be married. If we choose to have a civil partnership&#8212;if that comes in&#8212;it does not matter what the differences are between civil marriage and civil partnership. It will be my choice and absolutely no business of anyone in the chamber or anyone else what we choose to do if the law says that we have that opportunity&#8212;that everyone has that opportunity.</p><p>I loved Stewart Maxwell&#8217;s comment that sometimes people are forced to choose between different kinds of apples; it is not always about choosing between apples and pears. I will leave my colleagues to decide whether I am a soor old Granny Smith or a sweet Pink Lady. [Laughter.] Maybe I do not want to hear the answer to that.</p><p>Yes, we have done something pretty wonderful today and I am really pleased about that, but let us not kid ourselves that everything is solved just because we put this into legislation. There is still a long way to go. There is still discrimination out there and there are still a lot of people who need support before we get to the point at which, in reality, it just does not matter a toss what someone&#8217;s sexuality is.</p><p>I cannot mention everyone who has been involved in the bill but I will mention the Equality Network&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22879990", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is an absolute delight to be in the chamber today and to pass the bill very soon, I hope.

Perhaps he recognises in the motion the reality of Scotland&#8217;s inheritance from staying too long in a union that is certainly not working in Scotland&#8217;s interests.</p><p>The structural problems in the UK economy that came to a head in 2008 have been rehearsed in this Parliament many times. No doubt that will continue this year. It is our view that, if Scotland stays in the union, any benefits of an economic recovery will be more than outweighed by the continuation of macroeconomic and social policies that are neither supported by most Scots nor suited to enabling Scotland to achieve its full potential.</p><p>That is especially the case given that it seems clear that a central plank of the UK recovery plan is about reflating the home counties property market, with scant regard being paid to the effects on the rest of the country.</p><p>It is not just the Tories who back the coalition policies. Lib Dem Danny Alexander and Labour&#8217;s Ed Balls have both made it clear that there is a Westminster consensus on the need for further austerity. Rachel Reeves MP has said that Labour will be tougher than the Tories. She did not mean that Labour will be tough on the people who caused the financial crisis; it is the people on benefits she wants to hammer.</p><p>Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the UK election in 2015, I do not think for a minute that there will be a serious attempt to tackle the growing inequality in the UK. The inequality is not just national but regional. Nationally, the top 20 per cent of income earners in the UK earn on average 14 times what people in the bottom 20 per cent earn. Regionally, London and the home counties are like a completely separate economy from the rest of the UK and are set firmly on the path to boom and bust&#8212;again&#8212;by a Tory party that increasingly represents the interests of only that area.</p><p>As I have said before, Westminster&#8217;s skewing of economic and fiscal policies to suit the south is matched by a shift of public expenditure from other parts of the UK. Scotland is the worst hit, having lost more than &#163;8 billion between 2008 and 2012, during which time London and the south received an extra &#163;11.5 billion. It is no wonder that Vince Cable likened London to</p><p>&#8220;a kind of giant suction machine, draining the life out of the rest of the country.&#8221;</p><p>In September, Opposition members, including the Labour members who voted yesterday against free school meals and increased childcare, will, along with their Lib Dem and Tory partners, recommend to the Scottish people that they vote to endorse continuation of such policies, in preference to Scots taking the power to make their own decisions.</p><p>I find that bizarre. We have become used to speakers who back the union emphasising that Scotland faces big challenges, such as the difficult public finances, the overhang of debt&#8212;despite 40 years of oil revenues&#8212;and a reducing working population. However, such speakers overlook the fact that those challenges are the product of the union and are among the reasons why we need the powers to do things differently.</p><p>With the limited powers that are available to this Parliament, the SNP Government has been able to pursue advantages for Scotland, for example by supporting small businesses. That is a policy to which Labour now seems to be opposed: Patricia Ferguson said today that Labour will look again at the small business bonus, and last night Kezia Dugdale talked about business rates levels. We support the renewables sector, which provides more than 11,000 jobs, and we support growth areas such as food and drink and life sciences.</p><p>As the Deputy First Minister said in St Andrews the other day, Scotland has the opportunity to choose between two futures. For too long, and despite its many assets, Scotland has been in decline relative to every country with which it shares a land or maritime boundary.

I was particularly interested in this one, because I am a believer in having a national performance framework, such as Scotland performs, and I was interested to see it reviewed after five or six years of operation. I participated in the first inquiry into preventative spend that the Finance Committee undertook. If I remember rightly, Malcolm Chisholm was also a member of the Finance Committee when it undertook that inquiry, before the most recent election. Those two things tie in very well.</p><p>I was truly delighted in 2007 that not only did the SNP win the election, but we came to government with what I believed to be an absolutely fresh approach. That approach looked at Scotland as a whole and asked what kind of country we wanted to be, how we should target policy towards that and how we should monitor ourselves to see how to achieve that. I believe that the national performance framework, Scotland performs, set us on that road. It was a bold initiative&#8212;an integrated framework for policy delivery, in the parlance that is used&#8212;and it was a mechanism to assess Scotland&#8217;s performance and give us the discipline to look at successes, look at failures and look at what is best for our society as a whole, to move forward.</p><p>We heard the cabinet secretary talk about the measurements of GDP, employment, unemployment and economic inactivity and I was very glad to see in the report that he was open to reviewing and revising the indicators, based on discussion, because that is very important. Along with Patrick Harvie, I was a member of the steering group that Oxfam ran on the humankind index, and I know that the cabinet secretary was interested in looking at some of its findings. The wider discussion beyond the findings of the Finance Committee is certainly worth having.</p><p>That brings me to preventative spend, which is a major issue. Anne McTaggart just talked about cross-party action. One of my great wishes and aspirations for our Parliament, from the very start, was that we would get beyond the petty party politics that we hear so much of in here and recognise that our country faces some big issues, over which surely we could have consensus, and that no matter who was in power, we could move towards attaining some of those aims. That ties into the assessment of the nation through Scotland performs.</p><p>I found the Finance Committee&#8217;s first preventative spend inquiry quite difficult, because I had to recognise that although we had the boldness of single outcome agreements for local authorities, for example, and different initiatives to look at public service in general, our society very much works in silos. Sometimes, we found far too much of an emphasis on health boards or local authorities wanting to hold on to their own budgets and not have any kind of sensible sharing across budget lines, not only to make things better for people&#8212;it is all about people&#8212;but, in the longer term, hedge our resources better.</p><p>That brings me on to working together. I was interested to hear that, all of a sudden, the budget consequentials from the autumn statement at Westminster have all to be spent on childcare and mitigating the remnants of the bedroom tax after the mitigation that we have already carried out. I sat on the Welfare Reform Committee and the point that we should look at the bedroom tax again was not even raised as part of the budget scrutiny.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, in the budget, we are trying to mitigate and alleviate some of the effects of the welfare reform that has been imposed on us. In the news this week, I see that more than 500,000 people in the UK have turned to food banks since April and thousands have been hit by welfare penalties. Willie Rennie said at First Minister&#8217;s questions that we have turned a corner and things are good. I repeat that it is about people and there are an awful lot of people that it just ain&#8217;t good for.</p><p>I find it a bit galling that we have an Opposition party that talks about working together but could not even vote together to try to bring some of the powers over welfare reform to the Parliament. We hear Opposition members saying, &#8220;Use the powers you have. Use the powers you have,&#8221; but we could have had many more powers. We could have been doing better than just tinkering around the edges of trying to alleviate some of the issues that are being imposed by Westminster.</p><p>It is back to what Anne McTaggart said&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I was a member of the Finance Committee in the previous parliamentary session, before the most recent election, I am always interested in reading the Finance Committee&#8217;s reports.

When Osborne says that the UK is booming, he means that he has turned the tap on for a property boom in London and is pretending that that benefits the rest of the UK. That is his strategy to win in 2015.</p><p>By contrast, Labour seems clear on just one thing: it does not believe that it can win power in the UK without Scotland&#8217;s help. However, Labour&#8217;s message to Scots has changed. Until fairly recently, we were told that we were too vulnerable for independence. Now, Anas Sarwar and Douglas Alexander are telling the opposite story and saying that we are too wealthy for independence. They are trying to convince Scots that we would be callous to leave the poor of Preston to get by without our money.</p><p>The problem for Messrs Sarwar and Alexander is that there is an absolute lack of evidence that Scotland&#8217;s extra taxes ever get near places such as Preston. The Treasury and successive UK Governments have ensured that Scotland and many other parts of the UK have lost out, whether by bending the rules to spend billions of pounds on regenerating London under the Olympic banner or by keeping expenditure off tax and putting it on to energy bills.</p><p>Members here are in denial about losing &#163;4 billion a year if we vote no. If we look back, we see that we are already heading that way. In 2007-08, 9.9 per cent of identifiable public expenditure came to Scotland, but in 2011-12 we got less than 9.6 per cent. In 2011-12, every part of the UK with the exception of London and the south got a lower proportion of identifiable expenditure than it had received in 2007-08. In real terms over that period, Scotland lost more than &#163;8 billion and the north lost over &#163;0.5 billion while London and the south received an extra &#163;11.5 billion. Is it any wonder that Boris Johnson is backing the better together campaign?</p><p>Talking of the better together campaign, I was appalled to see that the Labour amendment contains absolutely no criticism of the Tories and simply has a go at the SNP. It is about time that Labour realised that Scotland taking control of its own resources will mark a break with the UK economic policy that has seen an increasing gap between rich and poor and between the wealthy south and the rest of Great Britain, let alone Scotland. It is time to tackle the paradox that Scotland has a higher GDP than the rest of the UK but has more poverty and less wealth.</p><p>I believe that, despite that paradox, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth has steered Scotland well with limited powers and resources.

Indeed, it had not registered in my thoughts.</p><p>I did a bit of research, and my interest was kindled. When I visited the west of Scotland regional maxillofacial prosthetics service at Glasgow&#8217;s Southern general hospital, I was absolutely fascinated to learn about the work that is carried out by eight maxillofacial prosthetists, who work between the Southern general and Glasgow royal infirmary.</p><p>The service is responsible for the provision of treatment for patients with a disfigurement in the head and neck region. The deformity can be trauma related or congenital, or it can be the result of cancer surgery. The work ranges from the fitting of simple surgical plates, which are used to aid healing, to the recontouring of a patient&#8217;s skull after trauma using a custom-fabricated titanium cranial implant. The laboratory runs prosthetic clinics and fabricates custom-made noses, ears, indwelling eyes and orbital prostheses for patients who have lost part of their facial contour through trauma, cancer or congenital deformity.</p><p>I am grateful to Michael O&#8217;Neil, Fraser Walker and their colleagues, who provided an in-depth tour and presentation during my visit to the Southern general&#8217;s max fax lab&#8212;which I have decided is much easier to say. I am glad to welcome some of the team to the Parliament this evening. The presentation detailed how far maxillofacial technology has come, from post-war prosthetics&#8212;which, I mention for interest, were generally attached to spectacles&#8212;to new, life-like silicone prosthetics, which can be attached using magnets or by fixing them to bone. During the visit, Michael and Fraser demonstrated by showing personal cases where maxillofacial technology has been used to correct abnormalities in the jaw or skull.</p><p>It was clear to me that the work is life changing. Small or major enhancements to appearance promote confidence and self-esteem, and they help to remove the stigma that so often unjustifiably applies to those who look different to what we deem to be normal.</p><p>I was very much struck by the personal bond between practitioner and client. Sometimes, it is built up over years. There is a closeness that, in many cases, is beyond that of the general practitioner or dental practitioner, because of the respect that is given to the clients. In return, there is an absolute trust granted by the client to the practitioner. That caring relationship can be demonstrated by Michael O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s charity work to raise funds for related causes.</p><p>I was also very much struck by the cutting-edge research and technology at the heart of the discipline, and that brings me specifically to East Kilbride&#8217;s own Michael O&#8217;Neil.</p><p>A maxillofacial prosthetist, Michael O&#8217;Neil from the Southern general hospital scooped a prestigious award recently at an international conference. Michael received his Wim de Ruiter Delft plate award for pioneering a technique that enhances surgical results for patients who undergo jaw surgery operations. His technique involves pre-planning the operation on 3D models of the patient&#8217;s skull that have correctly proportioned teeth.</p><p>The technique has been greatly successful in the correction of facial asymmetries and for difficult craniofacial operations. It allows pre-planning work to be done alongside head and neck cancer surgeons, which can greatly cut down operation time.</p><p>Using a computerised tomography scan, digital models can be created that allow for careful planning of the patient&#8217;s operation. The use of those models, together with 3D physical models of the tumoured site, allows large bone plates to be prepared with location clips to enable accurate placement of bone grafts that have been taken from another part of the patient&#8217;s anatomy. That breakthrough has helped to reduce operation time and has made reconstructive bone grafting more accurate.</p><p>I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to use a prop in the debate. I was very honoured to receive a miniature version of a skull that has been used for the technique. I know that the boys in the company, in particular, will be fascinated to learn that it was produced on a 3D printer. I have christened it wee Mikey&#8212;I should say that I have done so in honour of Michael O&#8217;Neil, just in case our minister, Michael Matheson, takes it the wrong way.</p><p>There is a great deal more that I could say about this work, but time prohibits me from doing so. I know that many of my colleagues would be as fascinated as I am by the work of the team in Scotland, so I hope that many will attend when I arrange an information session in our Parliament in the new year.</p><p>I have some concerns that I would like to express. There is no specific training for maxillofacial prosthetists and technologists in Scotland. Currently there are 14 qualified maxillofacial prosthetists in Scotland, but in six years&#8217; time there will be a 25 per cent reduction in that number because of retirement. The lack of training and discrepancies in pay structure make it difficult to attract maxillofacial prosthetists and technologists to Scotland.</p><p>Because of the low number of prosthetists who are required, it may be that it is not practical to form an exclusively Scottish education programme, but imaginative thinking and recognition of a service that is vital to many people and which has such potential&#8212;as is demonstrated by the work that is being carried out by Michael O&#8217;Neil, Fraser Walker and their colleagues&#8212;can surely reach a solution.</p><p>I hope that the minister will consider those points; I will write in much greater detail. I suggest that he should consider visiting the unit to speak directly to those who deliver the service and perhaps some of those who receive it. I am sure that he would find that as fascinating as I did.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22785062", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Maxillofacial Prosthetists and Technologists"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all those attending the debate tonight and all those who signed the motion.

I looked back at the debate that took place during the passing of the 2004 legislation for civil partnerships, and at that time, I asked:</p><p>&#8220;How can anyone sit here and say that it is equality if same-sex couples are not allowed to manifest their faith in the same way that mixed-sex couples can&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 3 June 2004; c 8935.]</p><p>even if the minister is happy to carry out the ceremony? I still feel that way. I just cannot get my head round the idea that some people should be treated differently from others; it just very, very wrong.</p><p>However, it may well be that, although I saw civil partnerships as a temporary solution that ought to be quickly overtaken, it was right at the time that that step was taken, so that we could move on. The figures that Jackie Baillie cited on how social attitudes have changed perhaps indicate that it was correct to introduce civil partnerships.</p><p>I have been struck by the amount of personal testimony that has been given; members have been extremely brave. No one need get their notebook out&#8212;I am not about to say anything stunning&#8212;but I would like to illustrate how time moves on and attitudes change. Thirty-odd years ago, my standing up and saying, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m not married. I live in sin,&#8221; might have been as stunning as saying the things that we have heard some members say today. Now, no one cares about that. In the 1960s, it might have been stunning to hear an 11-year-old say, &#8220;You know what? My mum&#8217;s just run off with another man and my mum and dad are going to get divorced.&#8221; I was that 11-year-old. I hid that from people at school, from neighbours and from other people I met for a couple of years because I was ashamed of it. According to social mores at the time, a child&#8217;s parents getting divorced was extremely shocking.</p><p>What we are doing today is extremely important and represents a natural step forward. I hope that we get to the point&#8212;when I am no longer here&#8212;when someone, in the course of explaining to Parliament something that had been taboo for many years, says, &#8220;You&#8217;ll never guess what. It&#8217;s not that long ago that same-sex marriages were something that people found it really difficult to talk about. People found it hard to say that they were in a same-sex relationship because that was what was right for them.&#8221; To me, the issue is just about equality&#8212;straight, simple equality. It is about accepting people the way they are. Why cannot everyone just accept people the way they are if they are not hurting anyone else? It is extremely simple.</p><p>That brings me on to the spousal veto. I had intended to talk about it more, but I am aware that other members want to speak. I was pleased to hear the minister say in his opening remarks that he would look at the spousal veto on legal gender recognition, whereby the spouse of a person who has been through the whole process can still prevent them from having their gender legally recognised. That must be looked at, so I am glad that the minister said that he would do so.</p><p>I would like to give due recognition to everyone who has worked so hard for same-sex marriage. There is a great wee book called &#8220;Six Reasons to Support Equal Marriage&#8221; by the Equality Network. What struck me when I looked through it was how happy everyone in it looks&#8212;it is such a happy document&#8212;and when we were standing outside in the wet mud getting our photographs taken earlier today, it struck me how happy everyone is that the bill is going ahead. Let us not lose that sentiment. We should be extremely happy that we are moving forward in such a way.</p><p>It is true that we still have a way to go, but what we are doing today is very good for Parliament and&#8212;in the longer term, even though some may not feel that way now&#8212;for everyone in it. It is also very good for Scotland, and we should celebrate that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752660", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That description &#8220;of the glorious diversity of human beings&#8221; from Elaine Murray just sums everything up.

It is about having the right to elect our Government of choice and thus influence policy and direction, and it is about the decisions about Scotland&#8217;s future being made by the people who care most about Scotland: the people of Scotland.</p><p>In parliamentary terms, it seems like the independence referendum has been a long time coming. However, as Drew Smith said, those of us who believe in independence have been campaigning for it for decades. When someone has a vision and belief that things can be better and fairer, months, years and decades go past and despite the scare stories, the tactics, and project fear, the campaign continues.</p><p>During the decades that people have been campaigning, things have changed markedly in relatively recent years. Devolution came here in 1999 and it has been good for Scotland. Gains are made for people, their families and communities when decisions are taken in Scotland. From early on in our reconvened Parliament, and through successive Governments, there have been gains such as free personal care, assistance for veterans, the smoking ban and the rejection of the privatisation of the national health service in Scotland.</p><p>The converse of that is that there is a heavy cost when we leave decisions in the hands of Westminster. In the 2010 budget, 76 per cent of Scottish MPs voted against further austerity cuts, but they were still imposed on Scotland. In the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill, 81 per cent of Scottish MPs voted against welfare cuts, but they were still imposed on Scotland. Sixty-seven per cent of Scottish MPs voted against privatisation during the passage of the Postal Services Bill, and we all know what is happening there.</p><p>Sixty per cent of Scottish MPs voted against the replacement of Trident in 2007, yet the UK is pressing ahead with new nuclear weapons. The big thing is that only 36 per cent of voters in Scotland voted for the Tories and the Lib Dems, yet we got the coalition in Westminster with all the problems that it has brought for Scotland&#8212;and with a lot more yet to come down the line.</p><p>That is why I aspire to independence. It is about always getting the Government that Scotland chooses and putting Scotland&#8217;s future in Scotland&#8217;s hands.</p><p>Our opponents like to go on about it all being about the constitution. They say that we never talk about anything except the constitution. The reality is that it is about so much more than that. It is about using the constitution to have the ability to do more than mitigate the awful effects of welfare reform.</p><p>I have the privilege of sitting on the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee.

It is in that context that we must judge the promise of a UK Government magnanimous in victory and committed to fulfilling Scots&#8217; desire for more control over their own affairs.</p><p>Reality will be very different.

Questions have been asked as to whether a member who is serving a prison sentence should receive their full salary.</p><p>Recommendations on what provision the Parliament should make for the payment of salaries to members of the Parliament and members of the Scottish Government is a matter for the SPCB and I move this motion on behalf of all my colleagues on the corporate body. Having considered this matter carefully, we are in unanimous agreement that the salaries scheme should properly reflect the reciprocal relationship between salary and the performance of functions.</p><p>We recognise that a number of factors could prevent a member from being in a position to perform their parliamentary functions. After looking at the range of circumstances in which that might occur, we consider that the Parliament should be invited to agree a mechanism whereby any member who is sent to prison by the courts should have his or her salary reduced to reflect the fact that any member in such a position would not be able to fulfil the full range of their parliamentary duties. I will explain the reasoning for this position in more detail shortly.</p><p>First, though, I stress that this is not a punitive measure. Questions of punishment are strictly for due legal process and the courts to decide and are not a matter for us. However, all of us on the corporate body believe that once the courts have exercised their role the salaries scheme should reflect the impact of any sentence on the performance of a member&#8217;s parliamentary functions. In considering this motion, the Parliament will be given the opportunity to arrive at its own view on the matter.</p><p>Last week, members received a letter from the Presiding Officer, explaining the corporate body&#8217;s decision on a salary reduction. It might be helpful to add that our initial consideration of advice from officials looked at the Parliament&#8217;s powers in respect of the disqualification of a member and of recall. I therefore assure members that we have considered those issues. There are complexities with regard to legislative competence and policy that will require careful consideration and the Parliament might wish to look again at such issues in the future. We also looked in detail at the &#8220;Code of Conduct for Members of the Scottish Parliament&#8221; and it is clear that, as the code presently stands, it covers only members&#8217; parliamentary duties and specifically does not extend to a member&#8217;s private and family life.</p><p>In the light of that analysis, the Presiding Officer instructed officials to examine the issue of payment of salary to a member who is serving a prison sentence and to bring forward advice to the corporate body. We met as a corporate body last Thursday morning to consider that advice and, having looked carefully at the matter, we reached a unanimous conclusion that any serving member who is unable to carry out the full range of an elected representative&#8217;s functions as a result of serving a prison sentence should not receive a full salary provision. We were also advised that modifications could be made by resolution of the Parliament under section 81(1), as read with section 83(5), of the Scotland Act 1998 to give effect to that policy. It is under those provisions that we have lodged the motion to which I am speaking today.</p><p>I again stress that the modifications set out in the motion do not seek to encroach upon the role of the courts. Our approach should in no way be interpreted as a punishment&#8212;that is for the courts. We have been mindful of the legal advice that we have received, namely that our decision should be underpinned by the following principles: first, that the provision made should respect the principle that salary is payable in return for the performance of parliamentary and other public functions; secondly, that the provision must not be motivated by punishment, retribution or censure; and thirdly, that the provision should be proportionate, of general application and consistent across the scheme in its treatment of members, office-holders and members of the Scottish Government who receive a salary supplement.</p><p>In agreeing with those principles, we then had to consider the scope of the modification and the amount of any reduction proposed, taking account of the availability of a member to perform his or her parliamentary duties while in prison.</p><p>I turn first to scope. We agreed that any action we were proposing should not reduce the salary of any member who could not fulfil their parliamentary role for reasons outside their control. I stress, therefore, that when members are unwell or require compassionate leave of absence, or when something such as adverse weather conditions impacts on their role, they will not be affected by this proposal. In our view, that would be a proportionate approach and it is important that we place that on the record.</p><p>We have taken the view that the proposed reduction should cover any member of the Parliament who has been sent to prison by the courts. That would include anyone who has been imprisoned for a criminal offence, who has been committed to civil imprisonment or who has been imprisoned for contempt of court. It also includes a member who is on remand, as they would similarly be unavailable to undertake the full range of duties.</p><p>It is also important to make it clear that the modification will not affect members&#8217; staff, who should be entitled to be paid, as we would expect that a member&#8217;s office would remain open for the duration that a member is in prison. This provision concerns solely the Parliament salaries scheme, which does not cover staff.</p><p>I turn to the proposed reduction in salary. In looking at the range of duties to be undertaken, we have based our decision on the definition of &#8220;parliamentary duties&#8221; that was previously agreed by the Parliament and that forms part of the reimbursement of members&#8217; expenses scheme. The definition has the support of the Parliament and has stood the test of time. It is, therefore, a definition that we consider can be relied upon to determine broadly the range of key duties of members.</p><p>It was evident that a considerable amount of a member&#8217;s duties relate to attending meetings of the Parliament and its committees. There is also a key representative function requiring the ability personally to be present and to pursue matters on behalf of constituents.</p><p>Prisoners&#8217; ability to communicate with the outside world is severely restricted.

Some limited constituency correspondence might also be undertaken, but all of that would be subject to the regulations of the prison and, of course, subject to data protection requirements.</p><p>Therefore, based on our assessment, we propose that a member&#8217;s salary be reduced by 90 per cent for the duration of the term of imprisonment. To be clear, this restriction would apply to any person entitled to a salary under the scheme&#8212;members, office-holders and members of the Scottish Government. Again, we consider the reduction to be proportionate to the availability of a member to carry out his or her parliamentary role in the circumstances.</p><p>In moving the motion, the SPCB recognises that there may be some consequential impact on pensions. As I am sure all members appreciate, pensions are a highly complex area. Our intention is that any change to the salary provision should have a similarly balanced and proportionate impact on pensions. We have, therefore, asked officials, should the motion be passed by the Parliament, to consider this further, involving the pension trustees, and to bring proposals to us in due course. If such a change is required to the pension rules, we will, of course, as we are required to do, consult with all members of the scheme affected by the proposal.</p><p>We also believe that, in considering the issue, we have acted with due regard to the principles of fairness and proportionality. I emphasise to members once more that the motion before the Parliament is founded on our view that the salaries scheme should reflect the fact that any member in prison would not be able to fulfil the full range of their parliamentary duties.</p><p>I invite members to support the motion, and I move,</p><p>That the Parliament, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 81(1), 81(5)(b) and 83(5) of the Scotland Act 1998, determines that with effect from the day after the date of this resolution the Scottish Parliament Salaries Scheme approved by resolution of the Parliament on 21 March 2002 is amended as follows:</p><p>(a) after paragraph 7 insert-</p><p>8.

She talked about it very well, if I may say. However, what struck me was that nothing had changed since I was on the Equal Opportunities Committee in the first session of the Parliament when the original report came out back in 2001.</p><p>That got me to thinking back to 2001. At that time, I was extremely shocked at what we learned&#8212;like, I suspect, members who came to the matter new on the Equal Opportunities Committee in this session. I thought that I knew a bit about what we called the Gypsy Traveller community through reading, a love of the culture, song and storytelling and the fact that, for some time, I lived and worked in Argyll, where there are a lot of Travellers. However, I was totally shocked at what I learned during that first inquiry.</p><p>I learned about the life expectancy of members of the community, which Malcolm Chisholm talked about. I was extremely shocked by the discrimination that people suffered when they tried to access GP services or to get into hospital, and I was horrified at the level of bullying of Gypsy Traveller children that was prevalent in schools, particularly secondary schools, which was such that the drop-out rate of Gypsy Traveller children from education was extremely high.</p><p>Looking back, I am struck by a couple of things. Ours is a very privileged job, because we meet people whom we would not otherwise meet, and there are things that stick in my memory. One of them is being on a site&#8212;a pretty bad site&#8212;in Argyll, where I met a lady who invited me into her trailer. She had been part of what is called the settled community&#8212;she had been given houses by the local authority and had given them up. When I asked her to explain to me why she had done that, she said, &#8220;It&#8217;s very simple: I don&#8217;t like living in a house, because you have to stand up to see out the windows.&#8221; I was struck by a recognition that I would never understand that. Part of the problem with what local authorities, Government and we as individuals who have got used to all the trappings of being settled try to do is that we try to understand, but we will never understand, so why do we not just accept that there are people who require to live differently from how those of us in the main stream of society have chosen to live, make an accommodation and get on with it?</p><p>A United Nations rapporteur is looking at housing generally across the UK, and I know that she is meeting representatives of the Gypsy Traveller community again today. I hope that we can reach an understanding when it comes to what she reports.</p><p>The other thing that I remember strongly was going into a cafe in Argyll with a representative of the Travelling community. On realising that we were finding it extremely difficult to get served and wondering why, I asked him, &#8220;Is this cafe always like this?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No&#8212;it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re with me.&#8221; I was shocked that such an open form of discrimination was happening in a decade in which the Parliament had been re-established. That impression was reinforced when his wife came and stood outside the door and motioned to him to come out. I said, &#8220;Tell her to come in for her lunch,&#8221; but he said, &#8220;Oh no, she won&#8217;t come in&#8212;she&#8217;s too frightened to come in here.&#8221;</p><p>It is absolutely awful that we are allowing people to live like that in this day and age, especially when&#8212;as Siobhan mentioned&#8212;on some of the sites in question, we are talking about rent-paying tenants who do not have tenancy agreements or any real rights. They have occupancy agreements, which amount to nothing.</p><p>I am conscious of the time, so I want to move on to discuss negative stereotyping and discrimination, which I think we all have a responsibility to address. I know that the National Union of Journalists has recently produced guidelines for its members. I was struck by the fact that one of its main guidelines is:</p><p>&#8220;Resist the temptation to sensationalise issues involving travellers&#8221;.</p><p>Everything that I have seen on television lately involving Travellers has definitely sensationalised the story. Some of the headlines in newspapers are absolutely disgusting.</p><p>I go back to what I said at the beginning&#8212;I was part of the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s inquiry in 2001, yet here we are in 2013 and, sadly, nothing has changed. At around that time, I remember lodging an amendment to the Housing (Scotland) Bill on the issue, which was voted down. I am not convinced that the same would not happen again. As Mark McDonald said, this is an issue on which we are all frightened to put our head above the parapet. I think that we need a champion, who I hope will be Shona Robison in her inequalities leadership role. We need to be much more vocal on the issue and to recognise that there are times when it is necessary to do things that are extremely unpopular, but which we must do because they are right. I would like to see that happen on this subject.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Where Gypsy Travellers Live"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to Christian Allard for reminding me that, in March, I turned on my radio and heard Mary Fee, who was then convener of the committee, talking about the inquiry and the report.

We began to do shared accommodation for young people, which was innovative some 20-odd years ago. Those who represent that area might like to know that that accommodation was in Alexander Street. I think that it was converted later to mainstream tenement housing and is no longer there.</p><p>I use that example to show that, all that time ago, we were worried about how young people setting out could sustain tendencies and felt strongly that it was not as simple as putting someone into a house and saying, &#8220;There you are. Get on with it.&#8221; It took intensive management. I can say that with confidence because I was the sowl who had to manage it. It was not easy.</p><p>I have some concerns that the current move to much larger housing associations and registered social landlords will mean that we lose some of the ethos of community-based housing associations and that that will take away from the intensity of management that is sometimes required.</p><p>What has changed since 20-odd years ago? We have excellent homelessness legislation and recognition that young people have rights, which is really important. We also have recognition that life has changed and that expectations and aspirations are a bit different these days. That is the backdrop against which the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s report was written. There are examples of good practice, as outlined by Mary Fee. In my area, South Lanarkshire Council runs homelessness sessions for all fourth year pupils across South Lanarkshire as well as mediation services and housing options services.</p><p>However, there appear to be variations in service delivery across the country. It is quite right that the committee has asked the Scottish Government to take an overview of the area. Education is important, but if there is one plea that I would make it is that, as well as the financial education and the stuff that goes on in schools across the board, we need practical education on things such as how to change a plug, what to do if a boiler packs in and how to paint a wall. It is about more than just the financial side. It is about making a house a home. That is the tenet of the report&#8212;it is about having and keeping a home.</p><p>Over the years, I have found that benefits are always an issue in that regard. I remember one case that I dealt with some years ago in North Lanarkshire. A young lass who had come out of care, who had had hard times in her life, ended up with a lovely wee flat. It was absolutely great and she got her life together. She went to night school and got her highers and then she wanted to go to university, but she could not, because she would not get housing benefit. The choice for her was to get educated with a view to having a career and lose her home, or to stay in her home and look at working in the same kind of job for years on end. We have got that wrong, too. We have to join up some of these services.</p><p>That brings me to the bedroom tax. What is happening is absolutely ridiculous. We sit in the Welfare Reform Committee every week taking evidence. This morning, we heard from the chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission just how pernicious the bedroom tax is. It goes against all the human rights that we stand for in Scotland. He said that he does not believe that this Parliament would have introduced it. I look forward to the other parties in this Parliament&#8212;apart from the Tories and the Lib Dems, who obviously support it&#8212;standing up and saying, &#8220;We would reverse the bedroom tax if we had the ability to do that.&#8221;</p><p>I received some information from Crisis, which is the national charity for single homeless people. It is really concerned by the latest stuff that Iain Duncan Smith and David Cameron are coming out with, which involves cutting benefits for the under-25s. Currently, nearly 35,000 people under 25 claim housing benefit in Scotland, for many different reasons and in many different circumstances. Some 17,000 have dependent children. We must also bear it in mind that quite a lot of the 18 to 24-year-olds who claim housing benefit are also working. It is not the case that those who claim housing benefit are getting their whole rent paid. There are people who work really hard and just need a help up. Eight per cent are sick or disabled and claim employment and support allowance, and 28 per cent are jobseekers.</p><p>In 2012, David Cameron said:</p><p>&#8220;Choice one: work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat ... Or ... Get housing benefit.</p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p><p>I will tell him why it should be different for some people. It is because they get a rotten chance in life. It is all very well for David Cameron to say that those people have responsibilities, but so does the Government. It has responsibilities to look at the rights of children and young people. Not every young person is able to stay at home until they can save up the deposit for a flat. I do not want to go into personal details, but I had to leave home at 16. It was not easy, but I got there by a lot of luck and a lot of good opportunities. An awful lot of youngsters just do not get that.</p><p>I know that I have to finish, Presiding Officer. This is about much more than just getting a home. It is about keeping it.

I put it on record that the leader of the Lib Dems in Scotland, Willie Rennie, backed the Electoral Commission, &#8220;whatever their advice&#8221;, and that Michael Moore, who is the Secretary of State for Scotland, is on record as saying that the commission is</p><p>&#8220;a highly respected independent body which provides essential oversight and advice on the neutrality of the referendum process.&#8221;</p><p>Aside from that, I would like to talk about the extension of the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds, which I hope we will endorse at decision time.

I would like to commend the Youth Parliament and all its members for its campaign, which was ably led by its chairperson in the East Kilbride zone, Grant Costello, who publicly espoused the case with such conviction and passion.

Therefore, committee members were extremely concerned that young voters be protected; it is absolutely crucial.

The post office provides an absolutely necessary service for some people, including those who are not online, to whom we owe that as an obligation.</p><p>I thank Jamie Hepburn for lodging the motion for debate. I also thank the Post Office representative and the CWU&#8217;s Liam Murphy who&#8212;separately, I might add&#8212;met me and gave me some super information. One point about the Post Office&#8217;s stuff is that, interesting though the material might be, the language that it uses is very different from the reality. In any information that the Post Office has ever sent to me or any other MSP, the word &#8220;franchise&#8221; is never used. Instead, the Post Office talks just about what a wonderful service will be maintained, with no mention of the potential loss of services.</p><p>East Kilbride post office has 14 members of staff, covering approximately eight positions, with a combined experience of 280 years&#8212;280 years of service. I was privileged to meet some of those staff on Friday, when they were campaigning against the proposals. What struck me was that every member of the public to whom the staff explained why the post office was shut that afternoon was fully supportive of maintaining East Kilbride town centre&#8217;s post office as a Crown post office.</p><p>On language, I think that it is also interesting that the Post Office&#8217;s note about the vote in favour of the first planned industrial action states:</p><p>&#8220;The result is therefore based on the votes of 68 per cent of Post Office Crown network staff, with the overall vote ... equating to 60 per cent of those staff. ... The result shows that a significant proportion of our staff&#8221;</p><p>back our plans. Hey! That reminded me of the 1979 referendum. It is absolute sophistry. It is ridiculous.</p><p>The Post Office says that there will be no redundancies, but that is only because the union won that argument in a court case. The Post Office talks about a compromise agreement costing up to &#163;20&#160;million&#8212;or about &#163;3,500 per person&#8212;as if that is hugely generous. For 280 years&#8217; combined service, that is not hugely generous at all to people who have shown commitment and dedication all those years. The Post Office also says that it could redeploy people, but for the staff in East Kilbride their nearest Crown post office is in Motherwell or Glasgow.</p><p>That is difficult enough for staff, but it is also not right that residents of Scotland&#8217;s largest town would not have access to a Crown post office. Many franchisees do very well and give excellent service, but I contend that in a city or large town the franchise outlets should be complementary to the Crown post office. I have been told that, on more than one occasion lately, customers have been directed to the big post office in the town centre when they have had queries that proved to be difficult.</p><p>As we have heard, surveys have shown that the Crown post offices are top for service. That is due to the staff&#8217;s dedication and commitment to on-going and regular training. That service to the public is becoming more and more important in the hard times that people are currently going through. With the move into financial services, I understand that the Post Office intends to trial current accounts&#8212;somewhere in England, initially&#8212;so it is more important than ever that we maintain good staff training.</p><p>I was particularly interested to hear that, after shutting two Crown post offices in Newcastle, the Post Office now says that a Crown post office is needed there. That is proof that there is a difference between a Crown post office and a franchise post office. Even if the Post Office wants to save money by ditching dedicated premises, why, rather than franchise to a supermarket, cannot it look at doing a deal to rent space while maintaining that Crown status?</p><p>Finally, we have heard that the Post Office says that its Crown post offices run at a &#163;40&#160;million loss. That has been scaled down from the &#163;70&#160;million that was originally reported. Mary Scanlon said that, in the stuff that she looked at, the Crown post offices were said to run at a loss of &#163;46&#160;million. It looks to me as though that figure is coming down all the time, so it may be that we will get to the reality.</p><p>This matters very much. I hope that, when a public meeting is arranged in East Kilbride&#8212;which I know lots of people will attend&#8212;I am able to be there, too, because I feel passionately and strongly about the issue. A Crown post office is a service that people deserve, and the people of East Kilbride certainly deserve it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689473", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crown Post Offices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, let me say that standing in queues for post office services is something that many people in East Kilbride do every day of the week.

It is an excellent idea to ask&#8212;as the motion states&#8212;for</p><p>&#8220;members&#8217; views on the efficacy of current public procurement processes and on the scope and potential for improvements&#8221;.</p><p>Procurement is an important issue that warrants much consultation and discussion. The number of submissions that have been forwarded to MSPs since the debate was publicised backs that up, as does the level of discussion across the board whenever the subject is raised.</p><p>I do not believe that one bill can&#8212;or, indeed, should&#8212;be a panacea for all procurement ills, but it can provide a framework and send very strong messages coupled with sensible, innovative and ambitious guidance to those who operate procurement processes.</p><p>As I have said before in the chamber, I served as a member of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland president&#8217;s commission on building a better Scotland, and I declare an interest as an honorary fellow of RIAS. The president&#8217;s commission focused on the construction industry, and some of its findings very much reflect the need&#8212;as I mentioned&#8212;to ensure clarity and a degree of uniformity in procurement processes, particularly for services.</p><p>Many processes are too time consuming and costly relative to a project&#8217;s scale. We have many times in the chamber discussed localism and the idea of keeping work in Scotland wherever possible, but in some cases the costs for the portal are very low, and common sense suggests that we can bring them down further to community level when we are engaging in procurement projects. In my constituency of East Kilbride, we have many companies that could benefit&#8212;as could the overall economy&#8212;from the ability to make procurement truly local&#8212;[Interruption.] It is quite apposite that we are talking about the construction industry. There they are, drilling away outside. It is nice to hear that there is work going on out there.</p><p>It is the application of regulations rather than the regulations themselves that can be a problem. The pre-qualification questionnaire is one example: there is sometimes a degree of going completely over the top in relation to questions. If something is already the law, perhaps there can be a presumption of compliance rather than a constant need to restate things.</p><p>We also have a risk-averse culture, to which my colleague Chic Brodie referred. Perhaps covering one&#8217;s back in our current blame culture would be a more honest way of putting it. There is often a misunderstanding of the regulations, with procurement being run on occasion by people who do not fully understand what is required.</p><p>I thank the Deputy First Minister for meeting me and the RIAS recently to discuss some of those issues. The RIAS is a membership organisation for the architectural profession, which has been hard hit by the economic downturn, and which&#8212;to my frustration&#8212;has over many years not been granted the respect that it is due for the contribution that it makes to our environment, economy and sense of wellbeing. That lack of respect is often manifested in the public procurement process.</p><p>In the past 20 to 25 years in particular, there has been a move away from the traditional appointment of architects as heads of design teams, and towards design-and-build initiatives that put large companies in the driving seat, with the potential to drive down quality in the name of cost and returns for shareholders. Very often when a project has been commissioned, the architect has not even met the client, which I find to be a very bizarre state of affairs. I am not convinced that that approach always offers the best value. As I have said before, research has shown that in the construction industry there can be 50 to 60 bidders for a project. Again, that is a waste of money overall.</p><p>In addition, there is the competition form of design procurement, of which the most notorious recent example has been the debacle involving Glasgow City Council&#8217;s George Square project. There were respected architectural professionals such as David Mackay and Andy MacMillan on the judging panel, and respected practices working up designs for submission, only for the competition to be abandoned. That seemed to me to be a ridiculous state of affairs. It was a waste of time and public money, as well as a waste of time for all the practices that worked so hard.</p><p>So, not only do we have bad procurement processes, we have bad pre-procurement. That is not good treatment of a profession that, in the words of Colin Donald in the business section of the Sunday Herald, has the</p><p>&#8220;potential to lift public spirits while promoting economic growth&#8221;</p><p>and is an area in which Scotland has shown</p><p>&#8220;unique, world-class quality over the centuries&#8221;.</p><p>We should celebrate that more. We should look at our procurement processes in the round and see how we procure all services for the public.</p><p>Again, I thank Maureen Watt and her committee for giving me the opportunity to make those points.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688659", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Procurement Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee for holding this debate.

I thought that it was perhaps somebody&#8217;s name.</p><p>One billion rising is a super initiative, which has references to the early feminist movement, as we call it. There were a lot of feminists around before the 1960s, but the term was not used. The campaign started on&#8212;I think&#8212;the New York subway, to encourage women to shout out when they were harassed in the way that Kezia Dugdale talked about, in order to embarrass the perpetrator and to put them on the spot.</p><p>It is sad that an awful lot of those initiatives have been lost. I do not know why; all of a sudden people said that feminism was not something to be proud of and that we had to keep it quiet, and girl power became the thing. To me, the whole girl power thing was just the kind of stuff that promoted the page 3 photographs that we are trying to get rid of as some kind of female choice. Instead, we should recognise that in our society and throughout the world there is gender stereotyping and there is abuse, from the mild pornography that is the page 3 photograph to absolutely horrendous abuse in all its forms, I guess the ultimate of which is rape as a weapon of war, which is happening all over the place.</p><p>It was interesting to read about the Eve Ensler initiative, which I did not know much about. I like the idea of flash dancing, which sounds pretty good. Something is far wrong, because I missed the dance strike at the Parliament. Let us hope that if there is another one, Kezia Dugdale will have us all&#8212;women and men&#8212;out there dancing in support of ending violence against women.</p><p>I have been reading quite a lot lately about the atrocities in Sierra Leone and Liberia, where women were subjected to terrible sexual harassment; they were battered and all sorts. The lack of respect was about power; the use of women as sex objects is about enabling men to feel that they have power.</p><p>I learned about another terrible form of abuse when I did some work in East Timor. Women were being sterilised by the Indonesian occupiers of the country, as a way of preventing them from reproducing, because there was an attempt to transmigrate Indonesians into East Timor.</p><p>Abuse went on in Peru, too. I was there during the dictatorship of Fujimori. There was abuse of women by Shining Path and by the Government side. Women activists who were deemed to be getting a bit too lippy and mouthy were abused.</p><p>In the Parliament, I think that all members have listened to people&#8217;s testimonies. I remember in particular the testimony of a young woman from Rwanda&#8212;I think that Sarah Boyack was there to hear that, too&#8212;who had hidden in her village and watched all her female relatives being raped.</p><p>Unfortunately the problem is spread right across the world. In eastern Europe, we heard that people who were supposed to stop such things happening, including people who worked for the UN, were trafficking women and using them as sex objects.</p><p>The campaign will go on. Anything that we can do to raise awareness of the issue, such as the one billion rising campaign and the dance strikes, is good.

It is easy to judge that, if we look back over the period of the debate about the management of our oil.</p><p>As even Jack McConnell recognised some years ago, population change is a powerful measure of economic performance. Any country that has enjoyed the bonus of 40 years of oil revenues and development should be doing well internationally, retaining its existing population and attracting more. Uniquely, that is not the case for Scotland. Westminster managed the impossible in creating a population decline in an oil-rich country. In all our near neighbours&#8212;Ireland, the rest of the UK, Denmark, Norway and Iceland&#8212;the population grew between 1970 and 2010. In Scotland, it stagnated for most of that period and people left to pursue lives elsewhere.</p><p>At the beginning of the debate over Scotland&#8217;s oil wealth, two big unionist parties dominated Scottish politics: the Tories, who have been reduced to a rump across the country; and Labour, which has retreated into an increasingly narrow heartland.

With half the value of oil still to extract, it is time to recognise the truism that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</p><p>It is sad that, in its desperate efforts to bolster the union, even the Labour Party has lost any sense of acting in Scotland&#8217;s interests. It was so busy telling us that oil is not Scotland&#8217;s salvation that it allowed it to be drained off to fund an unsustainable boom in London, for which we are now paying the price. Scottish people are now paying the price. For 40 years, the driving force has been the needs of the London Treasury and not the prospect of building a sustainable energy future and a sustainable social future.</p><p>Opposition parties demonstrate their lack of concern for the long term every time they welcome Westminster&#8217;s misrepresentation of the industry&#8217;s future. We hear a lot about recent OBR forecasts. They bear little relation to those of other commentators, yet members of the better together parties, whether in the UK coalition or not, simply trumpet them as proof of Scotland&#8217;s lack of potential in the industry. I heard Willie Rennie on television the other night talking about the OBR&#8217;s track record. Margaret McDougall talked about that today. The OBR was only formed in 2010. How can it have a track record? It is ridiculous.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687480", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Financial Strength"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Taking energy into account, Scotland is one of the richest nations in Europe, but still the nay-sayers talk us down, as evidenced by today&#8217;s amendments from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.

The event in the Parliament was excellent. I learned an awful lot that night about, among other things, the absolute potential that so many people with autism have, which goes beyond anything I could ever aspire to. It was truly enlightening.</p><p>I welcome, too, Scotland&#8217;s first autism strategy and our Government&#8217;s investment in that. However, while it is great that our strategy is there, there are always further steps to take after first launching a strategy. I know that the minister, Michael Matheson, is always looking to see how the strategy can be improved. There is always more to be done: bits we might have missed or could add to. I do not necessarily mean that that is always the Scottish Government&#8217;s responsibility, because some things that could be much improved are the responsibility of local government, in its areas of operation, or of the Westminster Government&#8212;issues such as benefits, for example.</p><p>I would like to quickly outline a few examples of issues that I have come across through talking to constituents who have autistic children or are looking after autistic adults.</p><p>I always find the terminology difficult. Mark McDonald was saying that people just do not understand it. Part of that is because of the huge variation among people who are on what we call the autism spectrum. That variation can be physical, as well as in terms of ability levels. I am not an expert in these things but I am told that the autism of one young chap in my constituency is so severe that it affects him physically as well and gives him very particular special needs.</p><p>I find that, very often, at a local authority level, services are not quite matched up. I know one family in which there is quite a severely autistic child who needs a high level of looking after. His mother, Catriona, also has responsibility for looking after her mother, who suffers from dementia. She finds that she can get support to help with her mum and she can get support to help with her wee lad, but she can never get both elements of support at the same time. As a result, she never gets any time on her own because, on the day when she gets respite care for her lad, she is looking after her mum, and vice versa. Meanwhile, her husband is working every hour he can to give his family as good a life as possible. There seems to be no way of bringing the services together so that she gets a break every now and then. If there were someone who could sit down with a family and look at all their needs in the round, that might make things a bit easier.</p><p>The transition from childhood to adulthood is important. I recently had an interesting discussion with people with varying needs&#8212;some were autistic and others had various physical needs. They were a group of people who have gone to the wonderful Sanderson high school in East Kilbride together. All of a sudden, they are leaving school, they do not have a youth club to go to anymore, either, and they have nowhere to go where they can meet as friends and feel comfortable in their routine. There is nothing there to help them. In this case, parents are getting together to provide something, and we are trying to help with that as far as possible.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686991", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Count Us In (Autism)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much welcome the report, &#8220;Count us in: it pays to listen&#8221;, by the National Autistic Society.

However, when we talk about human rights at a domestic level, all too often that relates to bad publicity. Annabel Goldie alluded to the erroneous statements that are sometimes made about who benefits from human rights in this country.</p><p>The Human Rights Act 1998 has had a positive impact on the lives of many people across the UK. It has been used, for example, to ensure that the dietary requirements of patients in hospitals and care homes are met; to prevent or remedy abuse or neglect of the elderly, learning disabled or otherwise vulnerable; to prevent disproportionate targeting of black or ethnic minority people by police and other authorities; and to ensure that children with special educational needs are not prevented from receiving an education.</p><p>I am particularly interested in how the Scottish Human Rights Commission investigates those areas and comes up with recommendations. I commend its independent evaluation, care about rights, which has done much to inform those in the care sector about how people should be dealt with with dignity. However, we should not be complacent. We must monitor the situation because there are always things that can be improved. For example, I am working on a case concerning the right of a constituent&#8212;an incapacitated adult, whose care resulted in physical disability&#8212;to have the perceived shortcomings in his care properly investigated.</p><p>I am hugely concerned about the impact of Westminster&#8217;s welfare reforms. I have no time to go into all that, but I suggest that members read the Official Report of this morning&#8217;s Welfare Reform Committee. How people are being treated makes for harrowing reading.</p><p>I want to ask about the rights of someone who has lived in a social rented property for decades and who has spent years turning their house into a home only to be turfed out because of the imposition of the bedroom tax come April, with no consideration being given to why there is a spare room or, indeed, to the trauma and expense of their having to move house. That is further stigmatisation of the social rented sector. Is that not in itself an attack on the human right of dignity?</p><p>It is a bit rich of Lib Dems to talk about legislation in this place when they and their coalition partners are imposing heinous legislation on people in Scotland. A witness said at this morning&#8217;s meeting that he did not believe that people in Scotland wanted to behave in that way. I certainly do not want to behave in that way and I hope that no one in this Parliament does.</p><p>The motion in the name of Roseanna Cunningham is on promoting and protecting human rights in Scotland, Europe and the wider world. That is a recognition of the brotherhood of man, which is why we must tackle trafficking in this country and detention at Dungavel. We might have stopped the practice of keeping children in Dungavel for any length of time, but children are just being punted down the road to detention centres south of the border. That is not looking after human rights.</p><p>I want a national human rights action plan that is meaningful. I do not want it to be eroded by people in Westminster who think that we in Scotland want to be cruel to people who live in this country and to deny them their basic human rights and dignity. I am not about that and I do not want any member in the Parliament to be about that. I ask all members to think on, about how we can have meaningful human rights in our national plan.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683467", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Rights"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When we talk about human rights at an international level, people tend to understand very quickly and look to places such as Syria and recognise that the people there do not have human rights.

For me, the sentence in his motion that stuck out was this one:</p><p>&#8220;there is a false perception that young people who come straight from education are not ready for the workplace and ... this perception makes it harder for young people to gain work experience&#8221;.</p><p>The motion goes on to say that the UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey</p><p>&#8220;noted that 68% of businesses found that school leavers were ready for work ... and 86% of university leavers were ready for work&#8221;.</p><p>The perception that young people who come straight from education are not ready for work is therefore very much a false one. Over the years, when I have been fortunate enough to take on a young person on work experience, whether they were at school, college or university, I would have considered employing the young person straight away in quite a high proportion of cases, if only I had been able to do so. I suspect that if such a study were carried out with other age groups, we might well find that the differences between age groups are not great.</p><p>When young people are trying to gain experience but get rejection after rejection, they begin to feel hopeless and that no one cares. Their self-esteem is lowered and they can develop an attitude that becomes almost self-fulfilling. We very much have to guard against that.</p><p>All communities have a responsibility in that regard. I am pleased that in my constituency, East Kilbride, many businesses are fully engaged in programmes with schools and colleges to ensure that young people are aware of what employers are looking for and can work to achieve some of the required skills.</p><p>I want to pay tribute to a few groups. Rotary clubs are active in East Kilbride. For more years than I care to remember and certainly during my previous career, before I was elected to the Parliament, I was very much aware of Rotary clubs&#8217; work on skills improvement to help young people on their way.</p><p>Coca-Cola Enterprises has just welcomed its 30,000th visitor to its education centre in my constituency. It has been working hard with young people in our community for a long time.</p><p>However, it is not just the big companies that work with young people; small companies do that too. James Dornan mentioned the proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises that are capable of employing people, and I think that it was Margaret McCulloch who mentioned a programme in which companies take on a young person to help with a specific aspect of their work, which can be helpful.</p><p>It is important to make such initiatives local and to work with communities, because the programmes become much more personal for the people who can offer jobs and for the people who are looking for jobs. That is one of the reasons why we launched our youth employment initiative in East Kilbride recently. I want to show the young people in East Kilbride that their community cares about them and will work with them to try to secure a better future for them and give them the opportunities that they need if they are to succeed. We have done that in partnership with East Kilbride Jobcentre Plus, Voluntary Action South Lanarkshire, the inclusiveness project, the Scottish Government, South Lanarkshire Council, Ingenis, the Prince&#8217;s Trust and many others. It is early days, but I hope that we will see success.</p><p>A couple of young people have already been given opportunities to work through the scheme. For example, Jordan Campbell from East Kilbride has a work placement at the Optical Factory in the town. As MSPs, we all have a duty to be advocates for young people and to work as well as we can to promote just how capable our young people are.</p><p>I like James Dornan&#8217;s idea of an information pack for MSPs, because it is a difficult landscape to work our way through. We have some Westminster initiatives, some Scottish Government initiatives and some initiatives of associated agencies. I like the idea of an information pack, but I like even more the idea of something simple that can go out to businesses and young people on a local, community basis.

We have made much progress, and that progress continues with the strategy, which is to be very much welcomed.</p><p>I want to focus on two areas, which are inextricably linked: stigma and self-esteem.</p><p>Let us look at stigma and what goes along with it&#8212;bullying and humiliation. Whether we are talking about depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia, and whether it is a one-off, periodic or on-going condition, the effects on the individual concerned are marginalisation and isolation. Those effects do terrible things to people.</p><p>If something presents in childhood or adolescence, we can imagine the legacy that the person has to carry into adulthood having suffered stigma and its associated problems for so many years. That is why the work of the see me campaign is so very important. That campaign does tremendous work, and I do not think that any member of this Parliament has not at some point taken part in an event through the see me campaign and been very impressed by the work that it does.</p><p>I also believe that if we can alleviate the stigma along the way towards eradicating it, there will be a direct effect on wellbeing and self-esteem. I do not think that we should ever underestimate the value of self-esteem and wellbeing. That fact was brought home to me a few years ago by the work of the East Kilbride dementia carers group. I remember watching the joy of dementia sufferers who, even for a short time each day, took part in something that made them laugh or smile and made them feel good. It may have been that, later that evening, those people could not remember or tell their partner, daughter or son what they had been doing, but at the time they felt good&#8212;and that is important.</p><p>What helps to promote wellbeing and self-esteem? Two things are participation and creativity&#8212;in the arts, drama, song, dance or culture. That is not to deny necessary medication and treatments but to enhance and maintain wellbeing and, in some cases, to prevent progression.</p><p>The work of Theatre Nemo is well cited in relation to the use of drama and the arts in the health and justice services. Nemo began its life in East Kilbride but has expanded through its work and recognition awards, and it is now Glasgow based.</p><p>We heard Mary Fee and Christine Grahame talking about the justice system and prison. In an article in The Herald last summer, the governor of Barlinnie prison, Derek McGill, claimed, in giving a snapshot from that time, that</p><p>&#8220;Of a prisoner population at Barlinnie of around 1100, as many as 260 could be classed as having mental health problems.&#8221;</p><p>He also said:</p><p>&#8220;there are people routinely here who are mentally ill, but not so ill they should be in a hospital. If we can stabilise them, get them taking medication and improve their self esteem, there is less chance they will reoffend when they go back into the community.&#8221;</p><p>One of the Theatre Nemo participants talked about</p><p>&#8220;Working as a team, knowing you can contribute to society and create something positive, can see yourself in a new light as someone with strengths and skills.&#8221;</p><p>The group has done a lot of good work in Leverndale, Rowanbank, Stobhill, the Southern general, Gartnavel and Carstairs.</p><p>Over the years, I have attended many Theatre Nemo events. The first time one sees someone, they are perhaps standing on the sidelines, slightly away from the crowd, watching what is happening with a bit of disdain or shyness, and it has been an absolute privilege to see the difference three or four years later. In fact, that happened recently: there was such a person at the front of the choir, singing at East Kilbride arts centre. That is wonderful&#8212;the self-esteem that such experiences bring is absolutely tremendous.</p><p>There has been a long history of the creative arts helping people to adapt to or recover from mental disorder, and there have been many academic studies on the subject. Back in 2003 to 2005, there was the arts, creativity and mental health initiative. It evaluated four arts therapies trial services across sites in Scotland. In a summary of the project, Dr Andrew McCulloch, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation, said:</p><p>&#8220;the art therapies have a valid therapeutic role and ... arts in health projects can improve the resilience of individuals and communities.&#8221;</p><p>The findings showed that, overall, participants experienced significant improvement in their mental health and social functioning. In particular, they highlighted improved self-esteem, communication skills and social interaction.</p><p>That further emphasises the need actively to reduce the stigma that is associated with mental ill health. Society has overcome other deeply ingrained prejudices, and we must keep working on that one.</p><p>For academic and practical reasons, I am pleased that our mental health strategy has commitments. Commitment 4 concerns working with the see me campaign and commitment 15 concerns increasing local knowledge of social prescribing opportunities. We need more of that. Both those commitments work towards the prevention agenda and joined-up policy implementation. I look forward to that implementation.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682576", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Successive Scottish Administrations and this Parliament have made mental health a priority.

I also thank the Scottish Refugee Council and the Refugee Survival Trust for the open your eyes to destitution in Scotland campaign, the petition and of course the assistance that they have given today.</p><p>An example of what the motion talks about&#8212;destitution of asylum seekers&#8212;is a man who, having fled, sought asylum in 2007, hoping that his wife and children would be able to join him when his claim had been recognised. He was dispersed to Glasgow, but in 2008 his case was refused and he found himself destitute.</p><p>He was able to gather evidence to submit a fresh claim but, again, his case was refused and he found himself on the streets, suffering from a complex range of health problems, including hearing problems, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and depression. At one point he slept under a bridge; at other times he used the basic night shelter set up by the Glasgow destitution network in a church. He began to suffer from insomnia and additional mental health difficulties. His health continued to deteriorate as he struggled to survive without any support for food or shelter.</p><p>Earlier this month, he collapsed on a Glasgow bus. He was rushed to hospital in East Kilbride in my constituency, where he died. He was aged only 52. He had not received support since 2009, save for emergency grants from the Refugee Survival Trust and Positive Action in Housing. He had not seen his children for eight years.</p><p>It is because of cases such as his, seen daily by organisations such as the Scottish Refugee Council and the Refugee Survival Trust, that the campaign has been launched. I have deliberately not said where the man came from or explained his asylum case because those details do not matter. What matters is that in this day and age, in our country, we have people living in destitution and suffering in that way. It does not matter whether they fled here or were born here; they are flesh-and-bone people with human needs like the rest of us&#8212;for shelter, for belonging, for sustenance and for esteem.</p><p>How do such things happen to asylum seekers? People can become the victims of destitution for a number of reasons, including errors, delays and complexities at certain points in the asylum process and support system. The United Kingdom Government is following a deliberate policy of making refused asylum seekers destitute in order to force them to return to the countries that they fled and to deter new applicants. That is quite clear in the UK Government&#8217;s regulations.</p><p>If someone faced going back to a country where they believe they would be killed or tortured or become homeless and starve, what would be the incentive to leave the UK? The policy does not seem to be working as the UK Governments thinks that it is.</p><p>The UK Government says that those who do not qualify for international protection should return voluntarily to their country of origin. How many Iraqis from central and southern Iraq who have left there over the past few years would consent to go back, irrespective of how hard life is made for them in the UK or whether they were given a lot of assistance to encourage them to return to where they fled from?</p><p>Many in the Scottish Parliament have campaigned on this issue for many years. I think that it was about a year after the Parliament was set up that the dispersal programme started for folk coming to Glasgow. I can see the faces of members from all parties&#8212;starting with the Deputy Presiding Officer and going round the chamber&#8212;who have been campaigning on the issue since then.</p><p>Successive Administrations have tried to do the best that they could within their devolved competences. I think that in this Parliament we have always felt very strongly that these matters are not reserved. It does not matter whether asylum and immigration are reserved; regardless of party affiliation in this Parliament, we have felt that they are not reserved and that we shall do whatever we can do here about them. Meanwhile, those of us who have fought successive Westminster Governments over the way in which they have dealt with the issue will carry on that fight.</p><p>I want to be clear that having the right policy for dealing with asylum seekers not only is the right thing to do but pays dividends for the country. The UK topped a recent poll in Monocle magazine on international soft power, soft diplomacy and so on. That success owes much to this year&#8217;s Olympics, not least because the Somalia-born refugee Mo Farah, who came to the UK as a child from his war-torn homeland, won two gold medals for this country.</p><p>The campaign against dawn raids run by school pupils from Drumchapel high, fronted by a group of asylum seekers and indigenous girls, is well known to the Scottish Parliament. The National Theatre of Scotland has now translated that campaign into one of the most powerful pieces of modern theatre, which has been a big success at the Citizens Theatre and is off to Stratford. It carries a positive message of a community working together to challenge some of the injustices faced by asylum seekers. The campaign had successes, but I do not have time to go into them. Unfortunately, we still have people being carted off from their homes and sent away, but some gross excesses were prevented by the work of the Glasgow girls. I am sure that members who have seen the theatre production will recognise it as a particularly powerful expression of the values that we want Scotland to project to the world.</p><p>It is unacceptable that asylum seekers can be forced into destitution in this country and left in legal and financial limbo for months, if not years. The open your eyes to destitution in Scotland campaign is a reminder to us all that it is time to tackle that injustice. We need improved decision making and proper support, as well as something for which we fought for years and which was given for a short time but taken away again: why the heck should asylum seekers not be allowed to work, given the skills that they bring to this country, to support themselves and stop their stigmatisation?</p><p>I do not think that such things are an awful lot to ask for. I hope that the Scottish Parliament will again send that very clear message down to the UK Government.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers (Destitution)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank those members who supported the motion, with particular thanks to Patrick Harvie, Malcolm Chisholm and Mary Fee, who quickly signed up to allow the motion to have cross-party support and thus the debate to take place.

However, this debate is about a different Labour commission&#8212;the &#8220;let&#8217;s kill the principles of the Labour Party in Scotland stone dead&#8221; commission, or, as Johann Lamont called it earlier, the cuts commission.</p><p>The motion invites us to agree with Campbell Christie that we require open and transparent consideration, rather than consideration on the current polarised terms. Yesterday on BBC Radio, Johann Lamont called for &#8220;a mature debate&#8221;. However, last week, Johann Lamont made it clear that for her, the debate is over. In the language of The Daily Mail, she targeted Scotland&#8217;s elderly, her sick, and her young people to carry the can for the economic crisis that was precipitated by Labour and worsened by the Tories. The welfare state&#8212;trumpeted by the better together campaign as the &#8220;glue of the Union&#8221;&#8212;was dismissed by Johann Lamont as the &#8220;something for nothing culture&#8221;. She tells us that we misunderstand. She simply wants a debate and claims not to know in what direction Labour&#8217;s policy is heading. Unfortunately for her, we don't need to rely on Johann Lamont to see where Labour is going.</p><p>Watching Labour&#8217;s conference, I saw Margaret Curran, Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland at Westminster, rush ahead of Johann Lamont, leader of Scottish Labour, to greet Ed Miliband. That action revealed Labour&#8217;s true pecking order. It reminded me that, as long ago as January, Margaret Curran gave much the same speech as Johann Lamont gave last week. So, Margaret Curran at Westminster signals policy changes on devolved matters before Johann Lamont gets there.</p><p>That was of course reinforced by Liam Byrne&#8212;he of the note that said &#8220;there&#8217;s no money left&#8221;. Ironically, Mr Byrne is now Labour&#8217;s welfare spokesman. At the Labour conference, he said:</p><p>&#8220;There has always been a balance in the welfare state between universal benefits and targeted benefits and I&#8217;m afraid as part of Ed&#8217;s zero-based review that balance has got to be looked at&#8221;</p><p>So, what was trumpeted as being the leader of Scottish Labour laying out her stall in a grand speech was actually just a badly executed part of a London-led campaign aimed at the 2015 United Kingdom election. The more Johann Lamont struggles to align her actions to Labour&#8217;s UK campaign, the clearer it becomes that the term &#8220;Scottish Labour&#8221; is just an electoral fig leaf. London calls the shots and is more interested in Scotland&#8217;s voting strength than it is in allowing Scots to have the power to make decisions that affect their children, their families, their community and their country.</p><p>Scottish Labour even called in its fourth emergency service&#8212;Douglas Alexander&#8212;to try to rescue that speech. He invoked Aneurin Bevan, who said:</p><p>&#8220;The language of priorities is the religion of socialism&#8221;.</p><p>The priorities of the people of Scotland, socialist or otherwise, are different from those of United Kingdom Labour. The people of Scotland showed that clearly when they voted in May last year for the SNP&#8212;a party that espouses social democratic values and laid out an honest manifesto.</p><p>Of course Labour&#8217;s 2011 manifesto included a pledge that there would be</p><p>&#8220;no upfront or back-end tuition fees for Scottish university students.&#8221;</p><p>Scottish Labour has welcomed the abolition of prescription charges, and as we heard from the Deputy First Minister, Labour&#8217;s council candidates pledged council tax freezes and falsely accused the SNP of trying to do away with concessionary bus travel. Yet Labour members wonder why no one takes them seriously when they say that they want an honest and mature debate.</p><p>Yes, choices have to be made. The SNP Government has made hard choices and has competently and efficiently delivered balanced budgets.</p><p>The much-loved and much-missed Campbell Christie explained that a supportive and inclusive society is about much more than money. He said:</p><p>&#8220;People say we can&#8217;t afford things now but in 1948 we couldn&#8217;t afford the NHS and the pension schemes but we did it&#8221;.</p><p>It is about the common good. It is not about people wanting something for nothing.</p><p>That is not to pretend that there is no crisis&#8212;of course there is a crisis. So much for the union dividend. However, if we are to deal properly with the crisis, make choices, decide priorities and maintain the values that Scotland holds dear, we need power over all aspects of tax and welfare.</p><p>Whatever the outcome of the 2015 election, Labour cannot or will not deliver. The better-together parties want to maintain the status quo&#8212;Westminster business as usual&#8212;extracting maximum benefit from Scotland for the UK Treasury.</p><p>If we follow Labour&#8217;s line, the price will be wholesale withdrawal of benefits from low-paid Scots and a bloated bureaucracy to enforce means testing. Who would have thought, after all the years of the working people&#8217;s struggle, that the best that the Labour Party could offer would be an end to universal benefits and one-nation conservatism?</p><p>The only way to get the powers that this Parliament needs and to sustain Scotland&#8217;s values is by voting a resounding yes to a Scotland with the full powers of independence.

We have to acknowledge the role that having a breast cancer awareness month plays in promoting the early detection of breast cancer and the work of all the cancer charities in raising that awareness. I thank Breakthrough Breast Cancer in particular for the help that it has given me for the debate and for its very memorable breast awareness message&#8212;touch, look, check&#8212;which promotes knowledge of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and the importance of regular checking.</p><p>I know that many members want to speak, so I will just start by outlining a few facts about breast cancer in Scotland. It is the most common cancer among Scottish women, and nearly 4,500 women are diagnosed every year in Scotland&#8212;in 2010, 460 of those women were in the area covered by NHS Lanarkshire, where I live and work. Around 1,000 Scottish women die annually from the disease and Scottish women have a one in nine chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. I know that others will develop those particular themes, so I will concentrate on a few points.</p><p>I want to raise concern about breast awareness in the lower socioeconomic groups. Women in lower socioeconomic groups have poorer levels of breast cancer awareness compared with women in affluent groups. The 2011 survey that was carried out by Breakthrough Breast Cancer found that</p><p>&#8220;79% of women in group DE had knowledge of any sign/symptom of breast cancer compared to 93% of women&#8221;</p><p>in higher socioeconomic groups and</p><p>&#8220;only 47% of DE women checked their breasts once a month or more compared to 60% of women&#8221;</p><p>in socioeconomic group AB. That is an important point because, although breast cancer incidence is higher in affluent groups, women in more deprived groups have poorer outcomes and survival rates. Sometimes that is because they were diagnosed at a later stage; and sometimes it is because there can be an increased likelihood of there being other health problems. That means that it is important to improve levels of breast awareness. I know that Breakthrough Breast Cancer would like to see more focus on increasing breast awareness among those groups, combined with better public health messaging, so that people can improve their general health and improve their chances of a better outcome.</p><p>Another issue is older women. Over 80 per cent of breast cancers occur in women who are over 50. I know that there is a pilot going on in England on age extension from 47 to 63. I think, too, that the fact that age is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer makes it important that older women remain breast aware. Like Breakthrough Breast Cancer, I would like the national health service in Scotland to do more to focus on educating that age group about breast awareness.</p><p>That brings me to prevention. Some 80 per cent of breast cancers are not inherited. That figure surprised me very much. Although I had heard the other figures before, I realised, when I saw that one, that I suffered from what I believe to be a common misconception, which is that people are much more at risk if there is breast cancer in their family. Awareness must be raised about that figure of 80 per cent, which links into the breast awareness campaign.</p><p>Researchers estimate that around 40 per cent of all breast cancer cases could be prevented if women maintained a healthy weight, limited their alcohol intake and increased their level of physical activity. I am not going to say anything about anyone in here except me. I am not going to comment on my alcohol intake, but I certainly could increase my level of physical activity, and I do not think that my weight is particularly healthy. Again, that is a big issue.</p><p>If we can increase awareness of the fact that 80 per cent of breast cancers are not inherited and that 40 per cent could be prevented, that would be a worthwhile campaign. A 40 per cent reduction would be equivalent to around 1,800 fewer cases of the disease being diagnosed in Scotland each year, so we should try to make a big difference by changing behaviours around the risk factors that are modifiable.</p><p>That brings me to diagnosis&#8212;I am aware that time is short, and I am glad that others will expand on these themes. There is a view that some health professionals are not as breast aware as they should be. The evidence is anecdotal, but we are told that some general practitioners are less breast aware than the women who present to them. There is a case for GPs receiving better education on the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, whether that is part of their medical training or part of engagement, in a continuing professional development capacity, with programmes such as the detect cancer early initiative. I know that many GPs are very involved with breast cancer charities, so I am not putting anyone down; I merely want to make it known that this issue is also important.</p><p>Some people believe that screening is not the best way to check for breast cancers. However, I believe that we should not allow that debate to put women off going for screening, as it is important. Further, we should ensure that women remain breast aware in between screenings.</p><p>I welcome the Breakthrough Breast Cancer initiative that has just produced a guide that contains the award-winning touch, look, check breast awareness message, which is available by texting &#8220;signs&#8221; to 84424. I should say that text users will be charged only their standard network rate and that no premium number charges apply. It is a very useful initiative. When the minister responds to some of my points and to those that others will make, I ask him to ensure that we maintain the detect cancer early campaign. It has been a big success and a great initiative, so we would like it to continue.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674173", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Breast Cancer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is nice after the rambunctious debate that we have just had to know that we are going to speak about something on which there is consensus in the chamber.

The commission published its report and submitted it to the Government in December. RIAS put together the commission to reflect increasing levels of concern about public sector procurement in Scotland, not just from the architectural profession but from others in the construction sector and from senior public sector employees.</p><p>We recognised the need for improvement to ensure the effective use of resources. Among the concerns that were expressed and recorded, and which continue to be discussed, were</p><p>&#8220;the increasing barriers to entry for micro-organisations and for small and medium sized enterprises&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;the pricing, reliability and value for money of services provided through the public sector procurement process.&#8221;</p><p>Those are significant issues and they have implications not only for individual project procurement, delivery and value for money, but for Scotland&#8217;s infrastructure more fundamentally. We need to remove the unnecessary and unintended barriers that are put in front of small and medium-sized enterprises, and to ensure that there is proportionality in the procurement process.</p><p>There are ways of tackling those issues, and I am sure that submissions on the proposed legislation will reflect on that. For example, we could review and amend the use of prequalification questionnaires generally and the Government&#8217;s proposed standard PQQ specifically. The UK and Scotland could be much better placed in the European league tables for procurement costs and so on, and much of the work that is required on PQQs reflects that.</p><p>I know that the system is being revised. I can only relate what I hear through the grapevine, but given what I am hearing, I do not feel much confidence that the situation will get an awful lot better. I would like ministers to be fairly radical in looking at the matter again, and to simplify it as far as possible.</p><p>To underline all that, we also need to change the focus of attention away from the quality of the procurement process to focus more on the quality of the outcomes. Another thing that we really have to do is to look at ways in which to reduce the number of bidders while still delivering fair competition. I understand that, in the construction industry, there can be 50 to 60 bidders for a project, and in the case of one project that was looked at, there were 300 bidders. That cannot possibly represent value for money in the economy. We understand from research that it can cost the public sector &#163;70,000 to award a contract that is worth &#163;130,000. That cannot be good for business or the economy. Research underlines, too, that it can cost the private sector nearly &#163;250,000 overall to bid for public sector work.</p><p>What can we do? We need new guidance to public authorities regarding the handling of public procurement for projects that fall below the European and Scottish Futures Trust thresholds. We need to take steps to remove the artificial barriers to entry for smaller businesses in the construction sector, because that will result in benefits for both the local and national economies. We must ensure that the appropriate expertise is in place, because without it people become anxious and risk averse, which results in poor-quality work.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671829", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sustainable Economic Growth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Unlike Ms Eadie, I welcome the Government&#8217;s motion.

It is obvious to me that that would be in our own best interests, but it would also be in the interests of the wider world. The choice for Scotland is quite clear. We can choose to remain a bit player through the United Kingdom, being unable to advance our own interests, let alone influence the international agenda, or, as an independent country, we can take responsibility for our own actions at home and abroad.

Stability, flexibility and investment, as previously demanded by Alistair Darling, are not words that immediately spring to mind when one looks at the UK&#8217;s public finances; nor do they spring to mind when one considers the records of current and previous UK Governments.</p><p>On television recently, Ruth Davidson tried to make political capital out of her claim that Scotland&#8217;s welfare spend exceeds our oil revenue.

Many initiatives have been announced during past decades, and successive generations have been party to numerous pilot projects in schools. Indeed, as a child, I was among a group of primary school children who were the first in the country to receive French lessons by television. It was a long time ago; if I say that the programmes were in black and white, I am sure that members will be amazed. Although that project did not last long, it instilled in me a curiosity about other languages and cultures that led to senior school studies.</p><p>As I have said, I do not believe that we, as a nation in modern times, have persevered seriously enough with learning of languages. We can call it complacency, arrogance or whatever, but it is a fact.</p><p>I looked back to 2006 when I last spoke on this issue. My research at that time showed that the number of school pupils who were taking a foreign language at standard grade had dropped by almost 9,000 since 1999. We have not properly addressed that decline during the intervening years. I am glad that we are now going to take a serious look at the issue because it is time we turned things around.</p><p>We should start by taking seriously the report of the languages working group. More important than that, we need to stick with it as a long-term strategy rather than using it in the short or medium terms. We are way behind and, for the future of Scotland, we will have to compete. It is a fact that English is no longer the international language of businesses and that the old imperiousness does us few favours. The 1.5&#160;billion residents of China, 1&#160;billion people in India and most of the 500&#160;million people in the European Union would not disagree. In much of South America, Spanish is spoken and in Brazil, one of the BRIC countries, Portuguese is spoken.</p><p>I understand that long ago, it was not possible to get a degree from a Scottish university unless one had spent a year working abroad. Moving to modern times, Maureen Watt talked about low take-up of the Erasmus programme. The number of students coming to Scotland to study for a year far outweighs the number of Scots going abroad. A monoglot is less likely to be enamoured by the prospect of a year abroad than is a student who is confident in his or her command of the native language of the host country. Stuart McMillan spoke very well about that.

That said, Kezia Dugdale made a positive point.</p><p>There are many issues on which we can be positive. Let us, for example, be positive about our children, who are more than capable of meeting the standard. The on-going success of Gaelic education has shown that learning and ability in other studies can be improved by learning another language and culture. At Mossneuk primary school in East Kilbride, the children learn German. The teachers have told me that that has led to success in other subjects.</p><p>Willie Neill reminded us in his poem</p><p>&#8220;Scotia est Divisa in Voces Tres&#8221;</p><p>that Scotland has three old languages&#8212;Gaelic, Scots and English.</p><p>Maureen Watt and Hanzala Malik told us about all the international languages that are now here in our country. That is a good basis for learning modern languages. We must follow that path if we want future generations to make an impact on the world.</p><p>Historically, Scots had, among other things, the reputation of being among the world&#8217;s best diplomats, at a time when the international language of diplomacy was court French. The influence of Scots has been felt around the world for centuries. We should remember that, we should be pleased about it and proud of it, and we should take advantage of it. However, in order to do that, we have to be able to communicate with our colleagues and friends around the world. We must get our language skills up there with the best in the world. If Poles can leave school with four or five languages, and increase their business skills and employment mobility in the process, there is no reason why Scots cannot do the same. If the French, with what some would say is a chauvinistic attitude to their language, can achieve a 65 per cent engagement with other languages, surely Scots can do the same. It is not a matter of achieving the impossible; it is a matter of having ambition for our nation. We must ask ourselves how much we can do rather than telling ourselves that we cannot do very much.</p><p>If Scots see themselves as part of world society as well as being part of Scotland, they will offer the nation a greater chance of stability and prosperity.

I know about localism at first hand because my previous career in housing was spent in communities who wanted and demanded more say in the decisions on issues that affected their lives every day&#8212;issues that defined their past and determined the future for them and their families.</p><p>That taught me an awful lot. Principally, it taught me that when decision making is grasped by the people whose lives will be directly affected by the decisions, sustainable futures can result. Community-based housing associations and co-operatives proved that point, because their management committees got to grips with slum tenements and post-war housing estates, improved the stock and managed it well. To illustrate that, we should consider the stock in comparable peripheral estate streets in Glasgow in the context of sustainability, capital expenditure and social fabric. We can also consider the wider action that housing organisations took.</p><p>My experience taught me that all too often people got fed up with initiatives that received ring-fenced funding for a wee while before it suddenly ended. I also learned about the perceived distance of local authorities and elected councils. That is not to say that individual elected members were not committed to their wards and were not working hard in their own ways. However, the municipal machine grinds on, and decisions are taken far from where their effects will be felt. The problem is exacerbated by centralisation of power and decision making at national level.</p><p>The Scottish National Party has long had a policy of there being a power of general competence for local government. For eight years, when we were in opposition to a majority Government in Parliament&#8212;a coalition of Labour and the Lib Dems&#8212;we witnessed national-level micromanagement of issues that would clearly have been better dealt with by the people at the coalface.</p><p>Labour&#8217;s councils and councillors recognised the ineffectiveness of that approach. As we know, they were among those who very much welcomed the transformation of relations with local government to successful partnership status&#8212;the historic concordat, in fact. There is joint development of policy&#8212;most recently in relation to the abolition of council tax benefit.</p><p>The approach can go further, through recognition that national planning issues necessarily run alongside local issues and initiatives that do not need run at strategic level, although they form part of an overall agreed strategy. Our policy is for true subsidiarity, whereby power and decision making are devolved as far as possible to the people who will be most affected by the decisions. Decision making is devolved from the UK to Scotland&#8212;a nation making its own decisions&#8212;from Scotland&#8217;s Government to local authorities and from local authorities to communities.</p><p>John Mason was right to say that different parts of a local authority area will have communities that have different needs and aspirations, which should be recognised and encouraged. He was talking about Glasgow; I can talk about South Lanarkshire, which is a vast local authority area. My patch&#8212;East Kilbride&#8212;has different issues, needs and aspirations from Douglas in south Clydesdale, and therefore needs different policies. Larkhall&#8217;s issues, needs and aspirations are very different from those of Thorntonhall, which is on the other side of East Kilbride. We should acknowledge that people can decide what is best for their local areas. I would like local councils and elected members to take much more cognisance of that.</p><p>I understand that there must be strategic policy across a local authority area, but for the life of me I do not understand why policies must then be rationalised across areas. Our Government in Scotland recognises that, as was demonstrated to some extent in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010, in the context of how we can truly empower people&#8212;to use the jargon&#8212;to make decisions for a sustainable future.</p><p>I am excited about the proposed community empowerment and renewal bill, which is mentioned in the amendment in the minister&#8217;s name, because there are great community initiatives. For example, in East Kilbride a group that is seriously concerned about the prospect of our village theatre closing is working towards perhaps taking over the theatre. We were unfortunate that we lost out in the potential community buy-out of the Hunter House museum in the town, which celebrates the Hunter brothers. I hope that that historical resource will not be lost in the plans that are going forward.</p><p>There is good potential to let people make their own decisions. We can all work together on that, and we should have the grace to acknowledge that the Government has opened up an awful lot in that regard. We should move forward to true localism. I support the amendment in Derek Mackay&#8217;s name.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Localism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise for being late this morning&#8212;particularly to Jackson Carlaw who, I understand, made the speech of his career, and I missed it.

Despite the fluster and bluster that we are hearing today, the committee worked in a very reasonable manner. There was sensible discussion, which was reflected in the discussions between the two Governments in the efforts to reach agreement.</p><p>We have agreed measures to resolve concerns about the risks that the bill as originally conceived would have posed to Scotland&#8217;s public finances. There is agreement on implementation issues and, of course, the Scottish Government has said that it will seek the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s agreement to changes in Scotland&#8217;s funding arrangements now and in the future. That is what democracy is about. The main thing is that the financial risks inherent in the block grant adjustment as originally proposed by the Calman commission have been changed, which is extremely welcome. Key changes have been made, and the bill now differs substantially from the one that was introduced in 2010.</p><p>It is important that things have clearly moved on since 2010&#8212;indeed, they have shifted quite a way from the time of the Calman commission recommendations. The country is still having a debate, and it is generally agreed that we will move further. There is a Lib Dem commission and a Labour commission, and even the Prime Minister says that further devolution will come. The question, of course, is when. If the original bill ever was a line in the sand, as one person called it, that line has been well and truly crossed. That is the problem with lines in the sand: the tide of public opinion washes them away.</p><p>Almost everyone now wants even more powers than there are in the bill. I certainly do. I want independence. I want those who live in Scotland to have the right to make the decisions that affect us; after all, those who live here are surely the best placed to do that. I look forward to the referendum in 2014 and believe that people will recognise then that the current bill was a missed opportunity and that they will not trust the anti-independence parties, which consistently make promises but do not deliver when the opportunity presents itself.</p><p>The bill was an opportunity to get powers to give Scotland the tools to stimulate the economy and create jobs, to make our control over income tax greater so that, for example, the Scottish Parliament would have flexibility on income tax rates for all bands, and to get welfare benefit powers to balance economic and social policies. Even on that issue, on which a degree of unanimity exists, no quarter was given.</p><p>I am sure that David Stewart&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate tonight will reinforce the consensus in Scotland on the devolution of the management and revenues of the Crown estate. Indeed, it is incongruous that, in 1998, the Lib Dems wished to amend the Scotland Bill to devolve the Crown estate but that the proposal is now opposed by a Lib Dem Secretary of State for Scotland.</p><p>Perhaps we should not be surprised that, in 1998, the Lib Dems also proposed amending the Scotland Bill to allow Scottish Executive ministers to have the right of statutory representation in the Council of Ministers. Of course, in his submission to the Calman commission on behalf of the Scottish Lib Dems, Tavish Scott, who was then their leader, called for corporation tax to be devolved, with</p><p>&#8220;all revenues accruing directly to the Scottish Parliament&#8221;.</p><p>Then there is broadcasting.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is interesting that we have just heard two representatives of the anti-independence parties, but they have not said anything yet about what they would wish to offer to Scotland.

Getting to where we want to end up&#8212;where fair trade is the norm at home and overseas&#8212;is all about baby steps, moving forward and lots of hard work, so the motion has a good title.</p><p>The work of the Scottish Fair Trade Forum has been commended: it should be, because it has done great things. It has been supported across the chamber and by all the Governments that Scotland has had. I picked up the forum&#8217;s annual review the other night.</p><p>Of course, everyone is talking now about Fairtrade nation status. Through the Fairtrade Foundation, the targets for that status reflect the targets that the forum is considering. I must say that I have some concerns, but I do not want that to be taken badly. Sometimes, setting such targets creates a rush to achieve them, so they are achieved by going de minimis, thinking that the box has been ticked and moving on. I do not think for a minute that that is what the Scottish Fair Trade Forum or anybody in the field is about, but we must guard against it and we must ensure that once we achieve a target we constantly monitor it, to ensure that it does not slip. I will make a couple of comments in that regard. We are looking at local authorities having active groups that work towards Fairtrade zone status&#8212;that is a target. That is great and lots of groups have worked towards it over many years. We should not forget that some folk have been doing this stuff for decades, before it became something that many more of us talked about.</p><p>We are looking for local authorities to achieve Fairtrade zone status. Local authorities in Scotland almost all declare themselves to be Fairtrade local authorities&#8212;I think that 30 out of 32 do so now. That is fine, but I would like us to dig a bit deeper into what that means. For example, it is all very well for a local authority to say, &#8220;We serve fair trade food in all our establishments.&#8221; However, if part of a local authority&#8217;s operation has been hived off to a private enterprise such as a leisure trust, does the local authority always ensure that those companies also serve fair trade food? No, they do not. That is another issue that we must continue to look at.</p><p>Procurement is very important; George Adam mentioned procurement of cotton. There is also procurement of many kinds of equipment, including leisure equipment and instruments that are used in the national health service. There is an organisation that looks at how that can be done. I do not believe that we are pushing hard enough on procurement; I do not believe that the United Kingdom Government is doing enough to make the case in Europe. Other countries have done more. For example, in Madrid&#8217;s bid for the Olympic games, it stated in its tender documentation that some stuff should be fair trade. It was not just about the coffee and the tea; it was about&#8212;I was going to say outfits, but I do not think that sporting guys talk about outfits&#8212;kits or strips.</p><p>Let us not get carried away too quickly with saying, &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it wonderful that Scotland is a Fairtrade nation?&#8221; Until we really tackle some of the big issues, we will not be a Fairtrade nation. We must tackle those issues so that when we get Fairtrade nation status, we can hold it up to inspection and be proud of it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fair Trade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It would be a novelty for me to speak in a debate on fair trade and not to mention that Strathaven was the first Fairtrade town.

Tonight, I am introducing the debate, so I begin by thanking Mr Chris Sinclair from East Kilbride and his guide dog Hugo, who initially brought the issue to my attention&#8212;or perhaps I should say &#8220;Hugo and his man Chris Sinclair&#8221;, as there have been a couple of occasions over the past wee while when assistance dogs have, indeed, made the Parliament their own.</p><p>In particular, I thank Guide Dogs Scotland for the help and information that it has given me and, more than anything else, I want to reassure our very own Parliament additional member, Mr Q, who has recently taken a bit of a huff with me because I have had other guide dog friends coming to the Parliament.</p><p>I am delighted to open the debate and to pay tribute to the assistance dog organisations that do such sterling work: Guide Dogs Scotland, Canine Partners, Therapet and the Search and Rescue Dog Association. I know that there are guide dog owners and volunteer puppy walkers in the public gallery. I thank them for attending the debate and for bringing the issue to my attention and to that of a number of my colleagues across parties and Parliaments and, of course, that of the many people throughout the country who have now signed the petition that asks for the United Kingdom Government to change the VAT legislation in respect of assistance dogs. I hope that members who are unable to be here for the debate will take the opportunity to sign that petition when they get a reminder to do so.</p><p>I have found that most people naturally assume, as I did, that guide dogs, hearing dogs and other assistance dogs are classed as working dogs, given the nature of the tasks that they perform for their owners. They are loved, but they are very different from the average family pet. When Chris Sinclair first told me that there is a VAT issue, my natural instinct was to say, &#8220;This can&#8217;t possibly be right.&#8221; We do, after all, have legislation that ensures equality of treatment. I was sure that there must have been a mistake somewhere, but after some investigation, I found that it was true that guide dogs and other assistance dogs are not defined as working dogs under the Equality Act 2010, so their food is not VAT exempt.</p><p>Let me turn to the definition of a working dog. A working dog is a &#8220;canine working animal&#8221;&#8212;a type of dog</p><p>&#8220;that is not merely a pet, but learns and performs tasks to assist and/or entertain its human companions, or a breed of such origin.&#8221;</p><p>Assistance dogs would certainly meet that criterion, especially as their duties mean that they are physically active for the majority of the day, but the current HM Revenue and Customs definition of a working dog appears to be based on the type of food that it consumes rather than the role that it performs. Working dogs are broadly defined by HMRC as sheepdogs, gun dogs and racing greyhounds. The food that is formulated for those types of working dogs is high in protein in order to provide them with enough energy to be active for long periods of time and thus to work effectively. That type of food is not suitable for assistance dogs, which require a specific diet to ensure low faecal output. That allows a guide dog to work out in public and provides the guide dog&#8217;s owner with greater control over their dog&#8217;s habits. It seems to me that that is not a sufficient reason to deny such dogs working-dog status. Their food is selected to best support the person with a disability whom they are assisting, and HMRC should take that into account.</p><p>Assistance dogs have a right of access, which allows them to accompany their owners everywhere and offers their owners confidence and independence. Assistance dogs greatly enhance the lives of an often-disadvantaged minority of people in Scotland and throughout the UK. They help their owners to perform everyday tasks, which increases their owners&#8217; physical, emotional and mental wellbeing, and they contribute to improving their owners&#8217; self-esteem. They are trained to assist with everyday tasks around the home and out and about, including unloading the washing machine, opening and closing doors and drawers, helping people with undressing and bedtime routines, retrieving items, assisting with shopping, and fetching help in an emergency. They do wide-ranging and fascinating work, and they are working dogs.</p><p>Assistance dog charities do remarkable work in training the dogs to perform those jobs, in raising funds and in ensuring that dogs are given to people who need them and not just to those who can afford them. To take guide dogs as an example, it costs about &#163;50,000 to breed, birth, wean, train and support a guide dog through its working life. Guide Dogs Scotland pays for the majority of the food that is given to its dogs. In 2011, the charity was responsible for 1,000 dogs. It incurs a yearly VAT spend of &#163;40,000 on dog food. If we made that food VAT exempt, we could provide a much-valued guide dog to another person with a disability in Scotland. In the UK context, in 2010, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association supported 8,000 dogs, incurring a VAT spend of &#163;300,000. That would provide a lot of help to more people if the charity could use that money in another way.</p><p>Folk donate to assistance dog charities not to see part of their donation ending up in the UK Treasury, but to support the services that those charities provide to people with disabilities. At a time when we are all too aware of the financial difficulties that many disabled people face in Scotland and the UK, I hope that the Westminster Government will take this opportunity to do the right thing. I accept that that might be difficult in terms of VAT exemptions for some individual owners who rely on their assistance dog and buy the dog food themselves, and that that would need further discussion; I get that. However, I believe that the situation with regard to VAT exemption for food for working dogs for registered charities could easily be sorted and very quickly implemented. I ask that the UK Government consider the matter without delay&#8212;I have done that in the form of the petition to Westminster&#8212;and, once again, I urge members to sign it. Legislation could be amended, if necessary, to make the food for assistance dogs that are funded by these charities VAT exempt.</p><p>I ask that the Scottish Government note the debate, take on board the issues and perhaps write to Westminster on behalf of people in Scotland who rely on assistance dogs.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22660706", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Assistance Dogs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When one speaks in a member&#8217;s business debate, one usually thanks whoever lodged the motion.

I am pleased that today we can further address the issue of legitimacy.</p><p>Surveys have demonstrated that it is, in fact, the belief of Scotland that the Scottish Parliament and not Westminster should speak for Scotland. I feel that we are doing that by taking forward debate on the extension of the Parliament&#8217;s powers towards independence. We have heard Opposition members talk here today and in the media about the need to consult civic Scotland. As the Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation paper shows, we all agree about that. However, we acknowledge today, as we did in 1989, that parties that are represented in the chamber consulted civic Scotland and the Scottish people. They attracted sufficient support to press successfully for the re-establishment of a Scottish Parliament. They did that not just by pressing a political case but by pressing the constitutional principle that sovereignty rests with the Scottish people.</p><p>It seems, in that case, that we are all agreed on where sovereignty does, in fact, rest:</p><p>&#8220;The ultimate sovereignty of the Scottish and Welsh peoples is a fact. Whatever the niceties of international law, Scotland and Wales can claim the right of self-determination if that is what they want&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, House of Commons, 22 May 1997; Vol 294, c 872.]</p><p>That was said by a Conservative, Bernard Jenkin. Then there is this:</p><p>&#8220;I believe that sovereignty lies with the people of Scotland rather than with any Parliament. That is a view established in the claim of right 1989.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Lords, 3 July 1996; Vol 573, c 1514.]</p><p>That was said by the Lib Dem peer, the Earl of Mar and Kellie, in a House of Lords debate. Indeed, our late First Minister, Donald Dewar, said in 1997:</p><p>&#8220;If they want to go for independence, I see no reason why they should not do so. In fact, if they want to, they should. I should be the first to accept that.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Commons, 21 May 1997; Vol 294, c 725.]</p><p>That seems to me to be unequivocal. So, why then do the UK anti-independence parties, even in this Parliament in Scotland&#8217;s capital city of Edinburgh, continue to deny the Scots the right to that self-determination and to determine the form that it should take?</p><p>In the 1970s, there was the wheeling and dealing that stymied the 1979 devolution referendum, which was of course a response to the SNP&#8217;s 1974 election result. The process leading to the 1989 claim of right and constitutional convention is well known and documented; it was of course supported by Labour and it followed the SNP by-election win in Govan in 1988.</p><p>Since the establishment of our Parliament here in 1999, the constitutional question has been raised many times by the anti-independence parties. We have had the Calman commission in response to an SNP minority Government that was elected in 2007. We have had a Scotland Bill that was introduced by the Labour UK Government and a Scotland Bill that was introduced by the current coalition Government. Incidentally, as convener of the Scotland Bill Committee, I am concerned that we have not had a substantive response to our report on the bill, given that it goes into the Lords this week for potential amendment.</p><p>All those things were introduced against a backdrop of certainty that Scotland&#8217;s legitimately and democratically elected SNP Government has always been clear in its belief in independence for Scotland, and that it stood on a manifesto commitment to hold an independence referendum. One could almost suspect that all the anti-independence machinations are about no more than spiking the SNP. After all, despite the Calman commission, two Westminster-instigated Scotland Bills and discussion that was supposedly about additional powers for Scotland, Labour and the Lib Dems seem to be intent on denying civic Scotland and the people of Scotland the right to discuss and determine the future of the nation.</p><p>I understand the Conservatives because they are at least consistent in their unionist viewpoint. As I said earlier, Labour and the Lib Dems pressed the constitutional principle that sovereignty rests with the Scottish people. Now, however, it seems that Westminster says different. My view is that it is time for all to choose what side of the constitutional question they are on. The Advocate General for Scotland, who is a Lib Dem, now tells us that the Scottish Parliament has no power to question the devolution settlement. He tells us that the union in its entirety is a reserved matter and beyond the powers of this Parliament to consider. That man was a leading member of the Calman commission&#8212;the Commission on Scottish Devolution&#8212;which was funded by this Parliament. It seems to me that there is a bit of a contradiction there.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659946", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Claim of Right"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I feel that this debate is a logical extension of the recent debate that we had on the future of Scotland, which focused on legalities.

That prompted me to reread the exchanges that I had with Mr Moore in November last year. I asked a very straight question:</p><p>&#8220;I am asking you to ensure that there is nothing in the Scotland Bill that interferes with the right of the Scottish Government, representing the Scottish people, to set the timing and wording of the questions for the referendum.&#8221;</p><p>His answer seemed straight, too:</p><p>&#8220;Those issues are not part of my bill, nor do I intend to bring them forward.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 17 November 2011; c 628-9.]</p><p>What a difference two months makes&#8212;or perhaps it is the difference that a Tory Prime Minister makes when the secretary of state&#8217;s party has tied itself to his apron strings.</p><p>It is not just the timescale or the question that the secretary of state&#8217;s party is backsliding on&#8212;it is voter eligibility too. The Lib Dems, who have long campaigned for votes for 16 and 17-year-olds, now do not believe that 16 and 17-year-olds on the electoral register should be entitled to vote in the referendum. As well as referring to the Liberal Democrats&#8217; 2010 manifesto pledge, I am sure that many of my colleagues taking part today will be able to cite many examples of Lib Dem MPs and MSPs going on record to support this cause&#8212;that is, the cause of votes for 16 and 17-year-olds, as opposed to the abolition of tuition fees.</p><p>Some Labour members also signed up to the votes at 16 campaign. In addition, as we heard from Mark McDonald and the First Minister, more than 180 Labour MPs supported an amendment to allow votes at 16 on the AV referendum, including Margaret Curran, who is currently on side with Messrs Moore and Mundell. Not many members who are here today have not at some time or other stated, or at least agreed with the statement, that our young people are our future, so why on earth are they trying to deny Scotland&#8217;s 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote on that future? There is no logic in that position, and nor is there logic in Scottish Labour&#8217;s motion, which calls for discussion with all quarters of civic Scotland to ensure a single question. Civic Scotland has called for greater powers for our Parliament over and over again, and that call is due respect from members of the Parliament. Therefore, let us continue the discussion, not dictate the answer.</p><p>I believe in independence for my country and believe that Scotland&#8217;s future will be best served if we rejoin the family of nations, as so many have done over the past decades. I believe that independence can bring us prosperity and a fairer society, which is why I will always campaign for it. I respect the views of others, sincerely held and stated, but I find it difficult to thole the denial that Scotland has the right to make its own decisions through the mandate of its democratically elected Government. The Government in Scotland has been democratically elected by Scots, but let us not pretend that the current UK Government has been, despite what David Mundell, Scotland&#8217;s only Conservative MP, insists on repeating.</p><p>Scotland has been told for long enough what it cannot do. Sadly, that has too often been by those whom we have elected to represent us. I ask those who have been elected to the Scottish Parliament to think long and hard about why they came to it. We should ask and talk about what Scotland can do and what we can achieve. That starts with Scotland making it clear to the Westminster Government that the referendum is ours and that it is our right to decide its timing and terms.

That is why I am so pleased that the Government&#8217;s motion talks about cultural identity and that the cabinet secretary put so much emphasis on the social, environmental and economic success of cities, towns and rural communities and how architecture contributes to that.</p><p>In that regard, she also mentioned the Doolan award, which is in memory of the late Andrew Doolan, who will be celebrated in this Parliament on 17 November. I am delighted to be hosting that event. The Scottish Parliament building won the award in 2005, so it is fitting that it is being presented again in what is arguably its natural home. Of course, the Government supports that award, which indicates that it regards architecture as a major contributor to Scotland&#8217;s economy and the quality of life of Scotland&#8217;s citizens.</p><p>Over the centuries, Scotland has excelled in many disciplines, such as engineering, medicine and education, and of course in many art forms. Among those, I would say that architecture and literature have profoundly shaped our perception of the world, our international profile and, of course, our national identity. The impact of the enlightenment on the physical form of Edinburgh is well known. The contrast between the rationally planned, bright, wide streets and formal gardens of the new town and the dark, narrow passageways of the old town is illustrative of changing ways of thinking&#8212;architecture is embedded.</p><p>We cannot talk about Edinburgh without talking about Glasgow. Charles Rennie Mackintosh is celebrated worldwide for his unique contribution to architecture. His buildings and his style continue to influence architects from New York to Tokyo, and his finest achievement&#8212;the Glasgow School of Art building&#8212;still operates, not as a museum but as a fascinating and vibrant art school.</p><p>The development of new, distinctive places is something about which I feel very strongly. We need to look ever more closely at the questions of identity and our built environment, and the creation of places of real character. How do we work towards achieving that? I would like to see a public that has greater expertise and skill in contributing to the shaping of its built environment. An interest in the built environment and a concern for architecture are not solely the preserve of a privileged few. My colleague Kevin Stewart mentioned the charrettes in that regard, and although that may well be a start and an idea to consider, I am not convinced that it is the answer to getting the public to make a real contribution.</p><p>Everyone in Scotland has a legitimate interest in the quality of our built environments and how they are formed. Everyone is entitled to live and work in a built environment that they can enjoy. From my own experience in the housing association sector, I know how vital the input of informed users can be in creating places that work technically and in which communities can thrive. I have seen it in action; it can be done, with some forethought.</p><p>If we wish to drive up the quality of architecture, we need to provide a favourable climate in which it can flourish. A favourable climate is one in which the quality of architecture is widely valued. In order to get that climate, we must promote, through education and encouraging informed discussion, a greater understanding of the value and benefits of good architecture. We should be innovative when given the opportunity to create new places and innovative in protecting the rich architectural legacy that we have inherited. That is, we should be innovative in terms of the architectural product and in enabling that to flourish.</p><p>In that regard, I am glad that our Government has the policy of promoting community asset transfer of precious old buildings. In that context, I refer to Hunter house in East Kilbride. A community asset transfer of such a building could stimulate community involvement in a sense of place, history and culture. That is particularly important in new town communities such as East Kilbride, where we have a couple of bits of really good modern architecture, such as the Dollan baths and St Bride&#8217;s church, which was a Gillespie, Kidd and Coia design. However, we also have historic architecture that should be cherished.</p><p>Reducing VAT for renovation, repairs and home improvements would be an innovative support for such initiatives and many others. It is innovative to promote good environmental practice. It is also innovative to ensure that procurement in Scotland is as efficient as possible and that costs are reduced as far as possible so that small and medium-sized businesses in Scotland are not disadvantaged, whether they are architectural practices or businesses in the construction sector.</p><p>The cultural strength of our nation is fundamental to our sense of national identity. The place that is in our minds, our ideals, our history, our aspirations and our vision of the country is implicitly linked with the physical place.</p><p>Few people have conveyed that better in the Scottish context than our own Alasdair Gray did. In his novel &#8220;Lanark&#8221;, the stunning visual artist and great writer has a character describe Glasgow as a magnificent city that we hardly ever notice, because nobody imagines living there. He contrasts Glasgow with Florence, Paris, London and New York&#8212;cities where, according to Gray,</p><p>&#8220;Nobody visiting them for the first time is a stranger because he&#8217;s already visited them in paintings, novels, history books and films.&#8221;</p><p>We should have such a confident sense of place here in Scotland and show it to the rest of the world. We have artists, designers, engineers, conservationists and people with other skills&#8212;working here at home and internationally&#8212;who are capable of doing that. We should support them and move forward with a recognition of the importance of place making to the wellbeing of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654653", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy (Architecture and Place Making)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I first declare an interest as an honorary fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.

Although I knew that it would be emotional, I was truly unprepared for the depth of emotion that I would feel at the needless carnage and the continuing effect that the severe loss of young life has had on the future of our communities, our towns and cities and our nation. Regardless of our personal views on the rights and wrongs of any war, as a nation we respect those who fall in the line of duty in conflict, and on remembrance Sunday this month we will publicly show that respect, lest we forget.</p><p>Those who continue to serve should not be forgotten and those who have served and retired to civilian life should not be forgotten or neglected either. Many men and women who leave the services slot back into civilian life with seeming ease, but some do not. The reasons are many and varied and can be physical or non-physical. It is not for us to judge them, but we should deal with them because we have ignored them for too long. It is right that there is a degree of unanimity in the Parliament on supporting the initiatives that the minister outlined today.</p><p>The Scottish veterans fund was designed to run as a complementary programme to the veterans challenge fund, which is administered by the UK Ministry of Defence. The introduction of the Scottish veterans fund, which was launched in May 2008, marked the first time that services for ex-servicemen and women had been provided directly through Scottish Government funding. The fund covers healthcare, transport, education, justice and housing, among other things.</p><p>As a former housing professional, I particularly welcome the housing strand of the veterans policy. In my job in housing, I often felt helpless and frustrated at being unable to assist or, indeed, prioritise applicants and families who were leaving forces&#8217; accommodation and trying to settle in social housing, although I am sure that I did not feel as helpless and frustrated as the families. The housing situation for single men and women trying to fit into civilian life was really difficult, so it is right that that difficulty is being addressed somewhat.</p><p>We have heard much this morning about the physical and mental health of veterans. Sadly, among affected veterans, as in our society in general, there is a particular stigma attached to the breakdown of mental health. As members have noted, that is evidenced by post-traumatic stress being masked by drugs and alcohol. Although I do not remember the figures, I remember an interesting members&#8217; business debate that Angela Constance secured some time ago on the subject of veterans who end up in prison and the mental health issues that are involved.</p><p>All in all, there is much more to be done and I await the minister&#8217;s review. I wonder whether it will consider further how veterans&#8217; experience can be put to good use by being passed on to others. I do not mean that it should merely be passed on to fellow veterans; it could be used more generally. I am sure that many young people would benefit from the experience of those who have served in the armed forces. Veterans&#8217; experiences&#8212;not just the traumatic ones, but those that taught them skills in sport and fitness and in conflict resolution&#8212;are very precious. This is just a thought, but perhaps some of the cashback for communities fund could be well used in that regard.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that we must mind the rights of serving personnel and of those who die while in the armed forces but not in conflict. The armed forces in general are a reserved matter, but I hope that the UK Government and Scottish Government discuss jointly concerns about our army, navy and air force personnel, as they do concerns about veterans, and act jointly to improve services and treat the issues. I raise that point today as I am dealing with the family of a young deceased serviceman and I am extremely perturbed at the experience the family has had and is having of not just military services but civilian services. I shall say no more today, because the issue is very personal to them, but will the minister agree to meet to discuss those issues further?</p><p>With remembrance week in mind, I conclude with a tribute to Mr Andrew Nicoll of Annan, Dumfriesshire. I know that Elaine Murray will know him well. Andrew and his colleagues are the veterans of the jungle conflicts that followed world war two in Malaysia and Borneo. Following a six-year campaign that they brought to the Public Petitions Committee of this Parliament, which many members of the Scottish Parliament dealt with by writing to Westminster, Mr Nicoll has told me that at last the Pingat Jasa Malaysia medal can be worn with pride, with royal authority and without restriction. That will happen for the first time on remembrance Sunday 2011. We should all respect the work of Mr Nicoll and his colleagues.

It is a history of maximising our capital spending, which we have also done this year, to support infrastructure investment and, of course, jobs.</p><p>In spite of the Westminster cuts, we have accelerated capital projects and front loaded the European social fund projects. However, we are now at the point where Scotland needs substantive capital borrowing powers to truly support economic recovery and enhance our infrastructure. To paraphrase what the First Minister said some time ago, Scotland needs borrowing powers that are appropriate to its size, ambition and potential.</p><p>That has been recognised across the board, and I am pleased at the consensual nature of the debate. The Scotland Bill Committee was clear that there was no principled basis for the particular capital borrowing limits that are proposed in the Scotland Bill. If I remember rightly, it recommended a cumulative limit of &#163;5 billion as opposed to &#163;2.2 billion. Even the Westminster Scottish Affairs Committee asked that the Government reconsider the proposed limits.</p><p>Borrowing is important to finance the capital investment that we all require. However, sources of borrowing are also extremely important, and that is reflected in the motion. How Scotland should borrow is important. Should we borrow only from the UK Government? I do not think so. Because it has control, it would share none of the risks.</p><p>Should borrowing only take place under the conditions in the Scotland Bill as introduced? Probably not. It seems to me plain that any privately or publicly funded organisation that borrows should have in place a Treasury strategy and an asset and portfolio management policy. Therefore, it is sensible and right for John Swinney to call for</p><p>&#8220;joint work to agree a clear, long-term and principles-based approach&#8221;.</p><p>One of the first principles of that must be that Scotland should be able to decide what capital projects it wants to do. We cannot rely on Westminster to decide that for us, because Scotland&#8217;s economy is different from that of the rest of the UK and we have differing priorities. We cannot allow our nation to rely on Westminster to decide what capital investment funding and what type of funding to propose when it suits Westminster. We need that degree of borrowing autonomy to increase the range of options and policy levers that are available to us to stimulate the economy during times of economic necessity. The Scotland Bill still has to go through many stages and there is still time to make changes.</p><p>On bonds, the command paper that came with the Scotland Bill explicitly states that the Scottish Government will not be allowed to issue bonds. That seems strange to me when Transport for London is using what are, in effect, bonds for its crossrail project, and Birmingham City Council is similar. States in the United States, Canadian provinces and regional and local governments can issue bonds to raise money for capital projects, so it is bizarre that we cannot. The Scottish Government is one of the few national or federal Governments in the world that cannot borrow. Indeed, in these islands, local authorities, the Northern Ireland Executive, and even English parish councils can borrow. As we have just heard from Colin Beattie, the Northern Ireland Executive can borrow at a much higher rate than that which is proposed for Scotland.</p><p>Today, it was interesting to hear from the cabinet secretary that Nick Clegg had already said that he thinks that we can start to borrow more quickly than had previously been envisaged. I was reading back over some of the comments that Michael Moore made when he came to give evidence to the Scotland Bill Committee. He said that he hoped to make &#8220;positive noises&#8221; about bringing forward unrestrained borrowing powers earlier than 2015. It would seem that Nick Clegg stole Michael Moore&#8217;s thunder when he arrived today.</p><p>Michael Moore also said that the &#163;2 billion was not set in stone. Nick Clegg did not say anything to suggest that he was talking about increasing that capital borrowing limit as well as conceding that we should have borrowing powers more quickly than was previously suggested. I hope that that figure is not set in stone and I hope that the Westminster side is prepared to offer the same level of co-operation that the cabinet secretary and the Scottish Government have advanced. Everyone in the chamber wants the best for Scotland and will support moving forward towards what is best for Scotland in relation to borrowing powers to enhance our economy.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648395", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill: Borrowing Powers and Growing the Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is worth stating that the motion by the Scottish Government comes against the background of sound financial management over the past four years by the Scottish National Party.

It is fitting that our first debate in the new session of the Parliament is about taking Scotland forward, because that is something to which we should all aspire.</p><p>The First Minister&#8217;s statement outlined the Government&#8217;s aspirations to build on the record of the past four years and the SNP&#8217;s vision for our nation&#8217;s future. It is crucial that a nation and a people have a vision and something to aim for, as should our cities, towns, villages and communities&#8212;geographic and thematic.</p><p>I am delighted to represent the community of East Kilbride, which is Scotland&#8217;s first, largest and most successful new town. I wish my predecessor in that honoured role, Andy Kerr, well and hope that he has a good future in front of him.</p><p>East Kilbride is full of aspirational people with a great pride in their town. Although it is a new town, it was built round East Kilbride village, which has a fine history. For example, it was the home of renowned medical pioneers the Hunter brothers. Sadly, South Lanarkshire Council has decided to close the Hunter house museum and I hope that the Government&#8217;s proposed community empowerment bill will enable active East Kilbriders, such as those in the East Kilbride Development Trust, to maintain that asset for the town.</p><p>The voluntary sector in East Kilbride is strong. Across the public services and the arts, people of all ages contribute to the wellbeing of the town&#8217;s residents. That is why the Government&#8217;s commitment to public services and the voluntary sector is welcome. I look forward to further information from the Government about social impact bonds, for example. I also look forward to the results of the Christie commission on public services and to an expansion of social and charity banking. I hope that credit unions and the co-operative movement will be very much involved in that. I also look forward to procurement policy that will assist the third sector as well as local businesses.</p><p>East Kilbride has a successful business community too, from large firms such as Rolls-Royce and Robert Wiseman Dairies to international award-winning companies such as Controlled Therapeutics (Scotland) Ltd and Glencairn Crystal Studio. It also has many small companies that have benefited from the SNP&#8217;s small business bonus scheme over the past four years and will continue to benefit from it. The export growth fund is also ripe for companies such as those in East Kilbride to benefit from.</p><p>The town has many innovative companies and new industries based in the technology park. They are backed up by world-renowned scientists in facilities such as the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre and, in South Lanarkshire College, a further education facility that is second to none.</p><p>East Kilbride has aspirational people who moved to Scotland&#8217;s first new town from 1947 onwards. The East Kilbride Development Corporation was wound up in the early 1990s and local government was restructured so that East Kilbride District Council disappeared and the town became subsumed within South Lanarkshire Council. Although the aspiration still exists, there is a sense in the town of lost identity and a perception that East Kilbride has been disadvantaged by being part of the larger South Lanarkshire Council. There is a view that the town has deteriorated and that its fine assets have been stripped in order to fund initiatives in other parts of the bailiwick of South Lanarkshire Council. Perhaps East Kilbride has been the victim of its own success. At the moment, that is particularly clear in the huge issue with social housing in the town. Under the right-to-buy scheme, there was an aggressive sales policy, as a result of which social housing is now suffering&#8212;or, perhaps I should say, the residents who wish to maintain their families and communities within the town are suffering.</p>", "hdate": "2011-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to kick off the debate this afternoon.

I will talk about an issue that has not been given much consideration. I have concerns about the way in which the committee was put together and the way in which it worked. While I do not wish to personalise the issue, the Parliament should ponder it.</p><p>The first thing that gave me concern was the fact that the committee appointed as its independent advisers those who were directly concerned in creating the bill. Asking those whose work underpins the bill to serve as independent advisers was not just bad practice&#8212;it inhibited the committee from carrying out its function. Those people should have been giving evidence, so that the MSPs on the committee could openly probe the thinking behind the bill, test its limits, feel its scope and use that evidence and the evidence presented by other witnesses to frame their thoughts on the legislation.</p><p>I have heard others say today that Wendy Alexander did very well as convener of the committee. I am sure that she did, but I feel quite strongly that instead of being convener, Wendy Alexander should have been able to make herself available to give evidence to the committee. We hear over and over that Wendy was one of the architects of the Calman commission. In fact, Pauline McNeill said today that it was Wendy who brought it about. It would have been useful for the committee to have heard evidence from Wendy Alexander.</p><p>Then, of course, there were Jim Gallagher, the former civil servant who was secretary to the Calman commission and probably the principal author of the report, and Professor Ulph, who was a member of the Calman commission panel of economists. They were both employed by the committee to provide advice and criticism of their own work. That is problematic. Knowing the genesis of proposed legislation is as important as testing its parameters. The committee lost that opportunity when it decided to appoint people whom it should have called as witnesses.</p><p>No minister, in the Scottish Parliament or the UK Parliament, sits on a committee scrutinising a bill that that minister has originated. The Scottish Parliament&#8217;s standing orders explicitly prohibit a minister in charge of a bill from sitting on the committee that scrutinises it. They also prohibit the sponsor of a member&#8217;s bill from being a member of a committee while it scrutinises the bill.</p><p>The principle underpinning those restrictions is to ensure that the scrutiny of legislation is impartial, that committee members are as free of bias as possible and that the committee feels free to call as witnesses everyone and anyone who seems to it to be appropriate, to give informed evidence on a bill&#8217;s provisions.</p><p>Committees have to serve the Parliament and help it to be better informed. We should never be in a position in which we can be subject to the criticism that a committee is being used as a vehicle for one faction to run legislation through it unchallenged. In a single-chamber Parliament, that is a particularly vital responsibility. It is one that the Scotland Bill Committee failed to discharge.</p><p>In common with many others, in my party and beyond, I have great concerns about what I believe to be the damaging effects that the Scotland Bill could have on Scotland if it is passed in its present form. There would be a deflationary impact on Scotland&#8217;s public spending&#8212;that is a major issue.</p><p>Another major issue, and one that is just as important for the long-term health of Scotland, is that legislation that is passed in such circumstances cannot serve anyone any good, no matter which side of the debate they are on. I ask the Parliament to reflect on those points so that they can be further considered in the next parliamentary session, after 5 May.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646515", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been interesting listening to all the different points of view.

One was the involvement of Scotland&#8217;s Futures Forum. The committee&#8217;s clerks and its convener and deputy convener are to be commended for taking such a forward-thinking approach and for adopting such an innovative way of looking at things. The other important factor was our report on the reform of public services, because I do not believe that it is possible to look truly at a preventative spend model without looking at how we reform public services. That is a big issue in this country.</p><p>Much of the report focused on the early years. That is as it should be, because there is nothing more important to any society than its children. However, achieving a significant turnaround of society as far as our children are concerned involves taking a long-term view and I am concerned that, because of that, it is far too easy not to even start. People think, &#8220;That&#8217;s away off in the future. We&#8217;ll get round to doing that.&#8221; When it comes to prevention, there is a mindset in our society that has to change. It needs to be realised in the health service that it is better to prevent than it is to treat and in the criminal justice system that it is better to prevent than it is to punish, for example.</p><p>Among the six points that emerged from the committee&#8217;s event on Friday, which was excellent, was that the debate on preventative spending needs to go much wider than just the early years and health and social care, and I think that that is very true. It is often the case that we deal with issues in crisis situations. That came out in some of the evidence that we took during the inquiry. Alan Sinclair, who helped us a great deal with his evidence, said:</p><p>&#8220;The overwhelming mindset that lurks behind how our public services are delivered is that we should invest at point of impact when things have gone wrong ... instead of going back and putting something in systemically.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 21 September 2010; c 2496.]</p><p>NESTA took a similar view when it wrote that</p><p>&#8220;The prevalent approach to tackling these challenges is to deal with the symptoms rather than striving to prevent their development.&#8221;</p><p>Sometimes simple and effective solutions can be put into place when we look at the short and medium term. Members will have their own examples, but one that comes immediately to my mind is the service gap facing those people in our prisons, hospitals and communities who have chronic mental health problems. This morning, I heard about the gap facing people who have to move from child to adult psychiatric services. Surely, if we intervene early enough and use prevention, that will be better than what we will end up with in the future. This morning, I also visited the Up-2-Us project, which is an early intervention to help young people to avoid ending up as pawns in the criminal justice system. These are fairly simple and straightforward potential solutions, so what stops us from putting such ideas into practice?</p><p>When taking evidence, the committee was frustrated to pick up on bureaucratic barriers, budget defensiveness, issues of ring-fencing and people saying, &#8220;That&#8217;s our budget.&#8221; A lot of work has to be done to change that mindset, which appears in all sectors. We do it in this Parliament. Local authorities, health boards and the voluntary sector do it. Everyone is looking after their own budget and closing their minds to the idea of being a bit more innovative in looking for solutions that can prevent social problems and save a lot more money down the line.</p><p>It does not always have to be about extra money. I was struck by a tiny bit of evidence that we heard. Somewhere in the south of England&#8212;I cannot remember where&#8212;a local health board paid to have roads gritted in an area in which there are a lot of elderly people. The result was that the health board had to treat fewer casualties and fractures over the winter, which meant a net saving to the public purse. We do not see much evidence of that sort of thing happening in our country because everyone is looking after their own budget. Perhaps Mr Swinney&#8217;s change fund will help to alleviate some of the pressures that mean that people think that they have to protect their own professions, services and organisations.</p><p>Such an idea must start from the top. We must all show a commitment to working together. There must be a recognition that we can do things differently and better. There is a responsibility on us all to stop making some of the populist sound bites that we are all guilty of and to work together.</p><p>The committee convener has already commended the report to the Finance Committee&#8217;s successor committee, with a view to it taking the recommendations on board. The committee&#8217;s legacy paper will also reflect that view. I can end only with the committee&#8217;s words about</p><p>&#8220;the need for a consensual approach in moving towards a more preventative approach to public spending&#8221;.</p><p>That will require leadership across all political parties and locally in communities. As the parliamentary session comes to an end and a new one approaches, I hope that we can commend that approach and make a difference to Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646049", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Report on preventative spending&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the Finance Committee, I, too, was very pleased to take evidence in the inquiry into preventative spend and to help to compile the report.

It was quite clear to me that Mr Swinney had listened and, against the background of the cuts, had balanced as far as possible a reasonable and good budget for Scotland that, as he said, will give people certainty. It has also happened despite the opposition to the supermarket levy. I have to say that I still cannot understand why the Lib Dems and Labour oppose that move but, as I think Bob Doris also said, we are where we are.</p><p>The Tories, the Lib Dems and, of course, Margo MacDonald have been very reasonable in thinking about the way forward. Derek Brownlee is always fairly reasonable and Jeremy Purvis was as reasonable as it gets, which is always a bonus. What did we get from Labour? It was all so predictable. We got the usual negativity, a lot of bluster, no real substance and certainly no ideas. Andy Kerr might well get up and talk about the &#8220;full measures&#8221; that Labour want, but his glass is half empty. I hope that when David Whitton speaks he will be a bit more reasonable, considered and thoughtful and, indeed, show some humility in what he puts forward.</p><p>We also keep hearing an awful lot from Labour about what it would not do, but what would it do? What is its policy? Perhaps its policy is to shut accident and emergency units to pay for GARL. I do not know, but I certainly think that people should be told.</p><p>We have heard all that despite the fact that John Swinney has come to the chamber with some really important initiatives and compromises. He has listened. I am delighted, for example, to hear about the voluntary sector initiative, which will be really important. There is also money for the freight facilities grant and urban regeneration companies. All of those measures have been taken against the background of the maintaining of the council tax freeze and pledges on prescription charges. Such moves constitute a crucial social contract with the people of Scotland. After all, it is important that people have confidence in the way that their Government acts in moving forward: I certainly think that people have confidence in this Government.</p><p>The other big issues include apprenticeships. The increase in the number of apprenticeships from 20,000 this year to 25,000 next year is really good news. That is against the background of having exceeded last year&#8217;s target of 18,500 modern apprenticeships: more than 20,000 were delivered.</p><p>Many members have said that we have had a lot of lobbying from students who have been concerned about bursary cuts. We are all in the same boat. Again, the cabinet secretary has listened, and I am pleased about that.

It has all been said already, so it is difficult to add anything other than to say on a personal note that I will miss him very much. In case you feel put out, Deputy Presiding Officer, I will miss you, too.</p><p>What really jumped out of the motion for me was what it said about the success of Angus College&#8212;and other colleges, of course&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;in providing high-quality training and resources&#8221;</p><p>and in making an</p><p>&#8220;exceptional contribution to building Scotland&#8217;s skills base for the future.&#8221;</p><p>I will speak about South Lanarkshire College in East Kilbride. As members may be aware, the college has been mentioned many times in the chamber. The building of the Aurora house, an eco-house that is a model for the future and a great training ground, has been highlighted, as has the college&#8217;s success in the skillbuild competition in 2009, in which its students were very successful in obtaining medals. Those successes are a great tribute to the innovative thinking of the college&#8217;s board, staff and students, who are always willing to look at new ways forward and at what is best for the students.</p><p>That is reflected in the report by Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education that the college received this week. I am not seeking any one-upmanship&#8212;or one-upwomanship&#8212;today; however, for the second time in four years, South Lanarkshire College has been deemed to be the best college in Scotland. The inspectorate said that it had &#8220;full confidence&#8221; in all aspects of the college. The report is super and provides great building blocks for the future. It refers to &#8220;excellent&#8221; practice and &#8220;sector leading and innovative practice&#8221;, and contains not one main point for action. That shows the level of excellence that can be reached with the full commitment of everyone who is involved.</p><p>I note some of strengths on which HMIE reported. The report states:</p><p>&#8220;Attainment rates for FE level programmes ... are consistently very high ... and well above sector average values.&#8221;</p><p>It makes the extremely important point that</p><p>&#8220;Sustainability is embedded in much of the college&#8217;s provision.&#8221;</p><p>It also notes:</p><p>&#8220;The college prepares learners very well for employment and further study.&#8221;</p><p>Both Elizabeth Smith and Margaret Smith picked up that issue in their speeches. These days it is extremely important that we prepare people for the workplace. Colleges all over Scotland have taken that on board and are doing it very well.</p><p>Time runs out quickly when there is so much to say. Andrew Welsh spoke about the community aspects of our colleges. HMIE said that, in South Lanarkshire College,</p><p>&#8220;learners enhance their employability and citizenship skills by participating in a range of relevant activities within the college and the local community.&#8221;</p><p>I mention in that regard the college&#8217;s involvement in the East Kilbride cross out child poverty campaign, which is extremely important.</p><p>I leave the last word to Katie McCall, the president of South Lanarkshire College&#8217;s student association, who said what HMIE already recognises&#8212;that</p><p>&#8220;our college is a fantastic place to study!&#8221;</p><p>That is a great tribute to everyone who is involved.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644071", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education Colleges"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I am pleased to speak in the debate, not only because of the subject, which is so very worth while, but because&#8212;as others have said&#8212;this is Andrew Welsh&#8217;s last stand.

I have a lot of sympathy with bits of the Green party motion. For example, land value taxation is worth exploring and I agree that the wealthier should pay more, which is why I am surprised that Opposition members do not agree with the supermarket levy. Considering that Sainsbury&#8217;s makes &#163;2.5 million per hour in the UK, I do not understand why that levy is such an issue for it. I also agree that the cuts that the UK Government has imposed have a disproportionate impact on poorer people.</p><p>I am afraid, however, that there we start to differ. For example, ending the council tax freeze now, which has been funded in each of the past three years, would cost Scotland&#8217;s hard-pressed local taxpayers an extra &#163;70 million in 2011-12 for a 3 per cent increase. I believe absolutely that the council tax freeze is good for Scotland.</p><p>Talking about taxation, I also have issues with what the Green party&#8217;s motion says on the Scottish variable rate, because if it were used, the power to vary the rate of income tax would create a regressive tax that would hit lower-paid workers the hardest. The tax bill of someone on the minimum wage, for example, would increase by 15 per cent. That is why I am surprised, as I have said previously, to see the Green party calling for that tax to be imposed. It is all very well for Patrick Harvie to say that the Greens just want the power to be there&#8212;the power is there in legislation&#8212;but they have proposed using it, despite the fact that Patrick Harvie said only in September of last year that</p><p>&#8220;a form of tax-varying power was designed that makes it very difficult, although perhaps not impossible, to justify using it.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 9 September 2010; c 28401.]</p><p>In the context of taxation, the Labour amendment asks for</p><p>&#8220;the introduction of tax-raising powers recommended by the Calman Commission and contained in the Scotland Bill currently before the UK Parliament&#8221;.</p><p>I was under the impression that the purpose of the Scotland Bill Committee was to consider how the best benefit for Scotland could be achieved. It seems to me that Labour members are predetermining the outcome of that process.</p><p>We face issues. It cannot be denied that times are hard, and I believe that it is incumbent on all of us in the Parliament and in the public services to think innovatively about how the best services can be delivered and who is best placed to meet the needs of their constituencies, whether geographic or thematic. We should strive to break down the institutional barriers that stymie progress on joint working, and we should consider disposal of community assets to viable community groups that are best placed to tap their potential. I cite the campaign in East Kilbride to save the Hunter House Museum and the sterling local work of the voluntary East Kilbride Development Trust.</p><p>Across Scotland, people are working together for local benefit. I believe that every member of the Scottish Parliament should be working for national benefit in the difficult times that we are going through. I would like to see recognition across the chamber that there are some big issues that are sacrosanct and precious, and on which we should all be working together. Good work has been done in the Parliament through its committees and on its behalf by Scotland&#8217;s Futures Forum. That is the kind of work that we should be looking at and pledging that we want to achieve. That is why, for me, John Swinney&#8217;s amendment is the only one that we should be considering and working towards.

Under the new proposal from the Conservative-Lib Dem Government at Westminster, Scotland has an opportunity to use its Parliament to advance its interests. That means having full discussions and debate, and refining proposals under which Scotland&#8217;s interests are not always sidelined for the sake of taking a standard UK approach.</p><p>As the motion in Iain Gray&#8217;s name says, the bill has its basis in the Calman commission. Calman was conceived in a very different world, however. At the end of 2007, the economic crisis was still in its infancy and the full effect of Gordon Brown&#8217;s failure as Chancellor of the Exchequer was yet to engulf his successors. The election of May 2010, which resulted in Westminster&#8217;s first coalition Government in 65 years, was more than two years away. As we look at the proposals in the bill, we should remember how quickly things can change. <place-holder colnum=\"31370\"/></p><p>We should recognise that, under its proposals, the most significant changes&#8212;the tax-raising and financial powers&#8212;are at least five years away.

We need to use our time wisely to ensure that the changes that emerge from the debate live up to Scotland&#8217;s ambition.</p><p>At the Finance Committee a couple of weeks ago, Danny Alexander spoke, as we would expect, of his aim &#8220;to give the Scottish Parliament significantly increased financial responsibility&#8221;.&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Finance Committee</em>, 25 November 2010; c 2818.]</p><p>He also used neutral jargon, such as &#8220;policy spill-over&#8221; and &#8220;no detriment&#8221; to reassure the Scottish people about the risks that are associated with the proposals. However, his promise of &#8220;no detriment&#8221;, even if it is real, extends only to further actions by Westminster. If the powers of this Parliament are inadequate or badly designed, as they were under the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish economy and our public services could face detriment indeed.</p><p>We have been there before. Given the incomplete powers at our disposal and the straitjacket of the funding agreement with the Treasury, the abolition of the council tax became unviable. Before that, on free personal care, Westminster took a windfall benefit when this Parliament acted within its powers, and continues to do so. Unless we are to operate on the premise that the last Labour Government was uniquely truculent regarding devolved matters, we should work together to ensure that the Scotland Bill mark 2 delivers a better relationship between the Governments and Parliaments in terms of responsibilities, risks and powers.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21137349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the publication of the Scotland Bill, not because I agree with it all but because, if it is passed in a suitably improved form, the bill could mark the beginning of a new phase in the devolution process.

Mr Purvis wants us to consider an innovation-driven economy, in which</p><p class=\"indent\">\"new ideas and skills ... emphasise the high end of the value chain, rather than replication.\"</p><p>We could all get behind that idea and there are examples of how we can move forward on that, such as renewables, which Stuart McMillan mentioned. I would cite biotechnology as a cutting-edge industry in Scotland, for example Controlled Therapeutics in East Kilbride, which makes medical products. The company has been a great success story, having won export awards and a Queen's award for enterprise. We have to celebrate our achievements rather than talking ourselves down all the time.</p><p>I recently chaired an event about exporting architectural skills. Scotland's architects and engineers are working all over the world. Some have done so with the help of SDI but many have gone out there and done it on their own. We have the entrepreneurs and the innovation-driven trailblazers.</p><p>I was interested in the section in the paper about science. That ties in with the Government's science strategy. There are issues in the paper with which we are all in accord and that we can take forward.</p><p>Debates such as this are good because we get to bang on about things that really matter to us. I have managed to find a reference in Mr Purvis's paper to something that I care hugely about, which is languages. Jeremy Purvis is right when he says:<place-holder colnum=\"31146\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Language skills are crucial to the competitiveness of Scotland.\"</p><p>I am glad that we have strategies in place to improve Scotland's language skills&#8212;strategies that can be backed by everyone.</p><p>Ross Finnie talked about small and medium-sized enterprises, which comprise 95 per cent of businesses in this country, and about business start-ups. It is true that Scotland's record on business start-ups has not been great, pre and post-recession and, indeed, pre-SNP. The SNP is improving things. The small business bonus scheme has helped businesses to survive the desperate times that mismanagement of the UK economy has brought upon them and will help them to thrive when they have a chance to get out from under the cloud.</p><p>Leaving some disposable income in the pockets of Scotland's council tax payers has helped, as have social benefits. The policy of freezing the council tax has meant that more money circulates in Scotland's economy, giving it a boost. I contend that those and other policies of the Scottish Government have helped the economic recovery programme. They have helped the Scottish economy to survive and have been innovative in themselves.</p><p>We can use Government to improve the economy but we could do a lot more with full economic powers. Imagine how much more we could do if the Secretary of State for Scotland had decided to put the findings of the Steel commission rather than of Calman up for consideration as the basis for the Scotland Bill. A debate on that is taking place next week so today I will only repeat what I have said before, which is that it is my firm, unshakeable belief that the Scottish Government should have substantial authority over the levers of power that most affect the Scottish economy: infrastructure; education and skills; business regulation; and taxation. Of course, only the first two are under Scottish control. As the Steel commission said,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there is a need for Scotland to have its hands more effectively on these four key levers and be able to pull all of them together.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21121594", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I have read Jeremy Purvis's paper, \"Making Scotland the Most Innovative and Entrepreneurial Economy in the World\".

It continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We believe that poverty should be defined more widely than lack of money, that it encompasses a lack of education, of health, of welfare, of self-esteem and of love. We believe that poverty corrodes children's health, their happiness, their safety and their aspirations. We recognise that children whose lives are blighted by poverty are at higher risk of educational failure ... We recognise that a life lived in poverty can lead to a life of drug abuse and exploitation.\"</p><p>We see that far too often. It concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We believe that only through the elimination of child poverty can we expect the children of Scotland to live their lives to the full, and to be able to enjoy the opportunities that the rest of society take for granted. We ... believe the time for change is here.\"</p><p>The initiative was well worth launching on Scotland's national day, but it should not end there&#8212;we should not just launch something, sign the declaration and then feel that the job is done.

George Osborne has said that he will make changes to the Scottish departmental expenditure limits and annually managed expenditure in his budget in March, so why should we announce spending plans that would then have to be changed?

Its leader told his conference that he would create a single police force, reduce the number of health boards and scrap quangos. There was no mention of discussion; just a unilateral decision.

After Calman, that will no longer be guaranteed. Instead, for more than 10 per cent of its budget, the Parliament will be able to rely only on the funds that can be raised from the basic rate of income tax. However, as announced in its 2010 budget, the UK coalition Government is making changes to income tax allowances that are designed to lift lower-income earners out of taxation and to increase the number of higher-income taxpayers&#8212;both of which changes will reduce income from the basic rate of tax. The number of people paying the higher rate of income tax will increase by up to 700,000 throughout the UK and perhaps by 60,000 to 70,000 in Scotland, and any income that is earned above the basic rate of tax is exempt from the Calman tax.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21103848", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: A Budget for Scotland's People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, thank you.

It was particularly clear that the Labour group had no real response to it. Labour members' contributions showed a lack of real understanding or acceptance of the need for unity for the benefit of Scotland.</p><p>The second point that requires to be clarified yet again is that tax powers have not been removed from the Parliament, as some have suggested. They are in the Scotland Act 1998, which only the Westminster Parliament can amend. I suspect that suggesting that they have been lost would be close to misleading Parliament. That is why I have real issues with Labour's amendment. It says that the Scottish Government has abandoned the Scottish variable rate of tax, but it has not. It goes on to express outrage that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a power given to the Parliament by the people of Scotland in a referendum should be taken away\".</p><p>It has not been taken away. Why, all of a sudden, are the Labour Party and those who support the amendment, their friends the Lib Dems, so concerned about referenda? Why is that suddenly so important when they are willing to shove through the proposals of the Calman commission, which are a major constitutional change, with no referendum? It seems that Labour and the Lib Dems have selective principles on display.</p><p>There is a concentration on process and a fuss about the cabinet secretary not reporting a change to Parliament. Why then did Labour not tell us that HMRC had mothballed the project? Why did the finance ministers Mr McConnell, Mr McCabe and Mr Kerr not tell us that?

This evening, I have learned a lot more in addition to what I found out from the excellent IUCN and RSPB briefings.</p><p>As a bit of an urbanite and someone who was raised in the city, I always thought of peatlands as being in the Highlands, the north or on the islands. I learned otherwise and my awareness rose. My interest was stimulated when I first visited Langlands moss, courtesy of the friends of Langlands moss voluntary group, which was formally constituted in 2006. Under the convenership of Richard Naismith, the group has worked extremely hard, along with South Lanarkshire Council and others, to improve and conserve Langlands moss local nature reserve for the benefit of all.</p><p>Langlands moss is a lowland raised peat bog that is situated on the southern fringe of the new town of East Kilbride. In 1994, the importance of Langlands moss was recognised and it was decided to restore the bog. The aim was to improve public access and to safeguard the site's long-term future. As part of the restoration, dams were installed to block drains and raise the water level. I think that it was Elaine Murray who spoke about the problem of conifer plantations being located on peat bogs. That was the case with Langlands moss, but the conifer plantation was felled and a boardwalk was built across the bog to allow public access. I suggest to my colleague Bill Wilson that if he comes to Langlands moss near East Kilbride, he will not be knee-deep in water and sphagnum moss Langlands moss was designated as a nature reserve and formally established in 1996, but much has gone on since then. To date, the friends of Langlands moss have been successful in raising a substantial sum of grant aid through the Big Lottery Fund, which has been match funded by a generous contribution from SNH. Other partnerships have been formed with the South Lanarkshire Rural Communities Trust, which financed the provision of materials for path improvements, and the South Lanarkshire criminal justice scheme, which supplied the labour for those path improvements. Kenny MacAskill visited Langlands moss fairly recently to see the work that had been carried out and the work that remains to be done.</p><p>What has happened at Langlands moss is an example of a community coming together, recognising that it has an extremely precious asset and using a variety of methods to restore that asset for the benefit of the community. There is still a way to go. In the few years since I first visited the reserve, I have already seen a difference in the plant life and the insect life. I say to Bill Wilson that I have not seen otters cavorting <place-holder colnum=\"30129\"/> yet, but perhaps that will come. I would love to sit at Langlands moss, with the wind farm in the distance, the high rises down the road and the otters cavorting. That is a lovely picture.</p><p>On a more serious note, I have recently learned just how urgent it is that Scotland's peatlands are dealt with appropriately. I know that the Government has already done work on that&#8212;a variety of peatland restoration policies and funding measures are in place, which the minister will no doubt tell us more about.</p><p>Aside from all the technicalities and the science of what we must do for future generations, we should recognise the potential value of our peatlands for the current generation. I have seen parties of schoolchildren at Langlands moss learning about nature and the wonderful resource that they have in their midst, which will open their imaginations and their minds to the bigger issues around our peatlands and the central part that Scotland has to play in the world and the way that it wants to be. The process of restoring and looking after our peatlands is of benefit to society now and will be of benefit in the future.

It is interesting that when the benefits system changes were announced, Labour's big concern was for the higher earners who would lose out in child benefit.

We have heard them talk disparagingly and, sadly, somewhat gleefully about an \"arc of insolvency\" that includes Ireland, Iceland and Norway. That is not only crass; it is a faulty analysis. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects those countries to recover from recession more quickly than the UK. The figures already show that they are moving in the right direction, and each of them has a better economic future than the UK, to which Scotland is currently tied. The UK is the only one of these nations that has a balance-of-trade deficit. Moreover, its growth rate is exceeded by that of Ireland, and Norway has exports that are worth almost three times as much as those of the UK. The arc of prosperity is now the arc of recovery, and Scotland should join that arc. Scotland should take control of its own finances so that it can join those independent countries, which best serve their populations.</p><p>The Calman proposals, which have been discussed many times here already, will not serve Scotland well or give us any powers to address the country's real and deep-seated problems.

Scotland needs more than that. We need the economic freedom to move in a different direction and to provide a different set of economic and fiscal alternatives and incentives.

In the document that we are debating today, the profile of carers section notes that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For those undertaking a caring role within the household, over 70% of carers have been providing care for over 5 years\".</p><p>The reality is that, within that 70 per cent, some will have been caring for those they love with learning difficulties for between 30 and 50 years&#8212;indeed, in some cases, towards 60 years. That is a lifetime of devotion, commitment and hard work.</p><p>In my area, the Murray Owen Carers Group includes such carers with a lifetime's experience of all these issues. Two of the members are, of course, Madge Clark and Jeanette Kelly, who many members know for their work with Enable Scotland and their awareness-raising petition to the Parliament's Public Petitions Committee in 2004.</p><p>That work has made it clear that this group of parent carers has specific and unique needs that are being neither recognised nor supported properly at present. As Enable Scotland noted:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is a generation of older carers who have a lifelong responsibility for looking after sons and daughters.\"</p><p>Great physical and mental pressure is involved in doing that.

Although it is in my name, it was jointly developed by me, Johann Lamont and Hugh O'Donnell. The motion</p><p class=\"indent\">\"welcomes the Older Families Charter launched by Enable Scotland, Quarriers, Edinburgh Development Group and the Learning Disability Alliance Scotland\".</p><p>The charter for change</p><p class=\"indent\">\"outlines 5 simple steps that can be taken to make life easier for this group of people and to plan for the long term needs of older carers and the needs of those that they care for.\"</p><p>First, the charter states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Local government should collect accurate information on the numbers, needs and location of older carers and adults with learning disabilities living in the family home\".</p><p>That is the way to get good planning. Secondly,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every adult with a learning disability living with an older carer should be able to have a person-centred plan that supports them in leading full lives, making and keeping friends and keeping in touch with their families if they leave home.\"</p><p>Thirdly,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In each local authority area there should be a dedicated officer for older families to provide local information, support access to services, identify their needs and plan for how they will change over time.\"</p><p>Fourthly,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every adult with a learning disability living with an older carer should be able to have an Individual Emergency Plan which identifies what could be done in specific crisis situations.\"</p><p>Fifthly, on the subject of advocacy services, which Mary Scanlon mentioned earlier, the charter states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Every family with older carers across Scotland should have the opportunity to access independent advocacy services.\"</p><p>Some local authorities are already taking some of those steps.

On my initial reading of the document, the part that I found most welcome was the intended further simplification of the skills system, to which other members have referred. As with so much within our society's constructs, I hear time and again about duplication of function and regulation and about the bureaucratic brick wall that well-intentioned employers and potential employees often slam into. I take on board the minister's point that one reason for that is the difficulty of working across agencies and indeed across borders. The strategy mentions promoting leadership development in Scottish businesses. Of course, we should all be doing whatever we can to help and promote Scottish businesses, thus allowing further training and employment and a contribution to Scotland's economic future.</p><p>Again, however, there are issues. The public sector procurement portal was a welcome development. It was planned that the portal would lead to simplification of systems and ease of use and access. I understand that it is being monitored, as any new system should be, but I ask the Government to do all that it can within the constraints of Scots law and European procurement legislation to ensure that opportunities for employment in Scotland are <place-holder colnum=\"29498\"/> maximised and that recognition is given to the value of local procurement and its ability to help to regenerate communities. That is surely a sensible way in which to support efforts to retain and grow the skills base.</p><p>Some sectors also face the burden of professional indemnity fees in relation to public sector contracting. I am told that that is a growing problem throughout the country. Again, in such times, I stress the necessity for all who are involved in public procurement to make sure that no disadvantage is inadvertently created for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>As well as supporting our businesses to allow them to support potential employees, the Government has given much to support Scotland's colleges, and they, in turn, pass on that support. For example, South Lanarkshire College in East Kilbride hosted skillbuild last year and its students won medals in that competition. This year, again, students at the college won construction medals when the competition was held in Wales. Students in our colleges are trained to a high standard and both South Lanarkshire College and the students should be applauded for their efforts and congratulated.</p><p>South Lanarkshire College recently retrained 400 former Freescale Semiconductor employees in East Kilbride through the partnership action for continuing employment programme, renewing a current workforce with new skills to take advantage of new opportunities. When we talk about skills and training, we sometimes focus on young people and fall into the trap of forgetting about retraining. Lifelong learning is important. It is only a few months ago, too, that I held a members' business debate about the Aurora house, which has been developed by Dawn Homes and South Lanarkshire College. The need for homes and skills for the future is recognised by the Government's refreshed skills strategy.</p><p>The briefing paper from Scotland's Colleges states that colleges are at the heart of their local communities and play a major role in social inclusion. That is true. Folks from all walks of life attend our colleges, which have an innate understanding of the needs and requirements of their local areas. The building of community builds towards economic and social success, and the colleges in Lanarkshire collectively work towards that. We should encourage our colleges, but we should never be complacent when it comes to good practice. We should always look at what others do, contrasting and comparing, and we should never be shy of investigating what works elsewhere.</p><p>I have a particular interest in our built heritage and therefore design and construction skills. One element of that is our traditional building trades. <place-holder colnum=\"29499\"/></p><p>There has been a fairly recent resurgence of interest in such trades because of the recognition, for example, that sensitive rehabilitation of older housing stock is both cost effective and sustainable. Research demonstrates that older buildings can perform well in energy terms&#8212;for example, because they have natural insulation&#8212;and rehabilitation can be a natural way of recycling building materials. Whether it is our castles, our tenement housing or our dry-stane dykes, specialised traditional skills are required to preserve our heritage, so we must preserve those skills.</p><p>Some other European nations hold their traditional skills, and therefore their traditional skills practitioners, in great esteem. That does not apply only to construction trades, of course. I am grateful to Mr James Simpson, heritage architect, for pointing out to me the compagnons du devoir system in France, under which young apprentices and journeyfolk train in French traditional skills. It is a rigorous system that takes a minimum of seven years. It involves a lot of off-the-job training, mentoring, the systematic use of older and retired workers, and the management of movement and change through a network of colleges. Perhaps we can learn something from that. Scotland still has lots of active trades guilds, for example, with a massive reservoir of skills and experience in those workers who are slightly more developed in years. Those skills and that experience are ready to be tapped for the benefit of young apprentices and trainees and the on-going benefit of Scotland. Can we look towards making that link and using that talent and experience?</p><p>We have opportunities in the short, medium and long term to tool up our country for the coming years. We should take full advantage of those opportunities and, as so many others have said today, ensure that Scotland is indeed ready to face the future.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006955", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Skills Strategy (Refresh)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The skills strategy refresh is welcome and necessary in the current economic climate.

The number of signatures is a mark of the respect that members of the Scottish Parliament have for Richard Demarco and his work.

How does one condense achievements such as Richard Demarco's into a paragraph? Similarly, how can I do justice to Richard Demarco and his career in just a few minutes in this debate? I am sure that all members feel the same as I do.<place-holder colnum=\"28803\"/></p><p>One could list just a few milestones in Richard Demarco's career. He launched the Traverse theatre and gallery in 1963, and he opened the Richard Demarco gallery in 1966. One can mention his long tenure as director of contemporary visual arts exhibitions for the Edinburgh international festival, his directorship of Sean Connery's Scottish International Education Trust, and the establishment of the Demarco European Art Foundation and the incredible Demarco archives.</p><p>During his long career, which continues, Richard Demarco has been at the forefront of Scotland in Europe. He has promoted cross-cultural links, taking Scottish art abroad and bringing other European artists here. He has not done so in a timid or safe manner. This is a man who has always taken what others would perceive to be risks&#8212;he would perceive his actions to be the right and necessary things to do. His contribution to the understanding of European art between 1968 and 1989, through his journeys behind the iron curtain and his related lecture work, is immense. His drawings, paintings and prints are held in more than 1,200 collections.</p><p>One could also list the honours that have been bestowed on Richard Demarco, aside from his honorary fellowships: chevalier de l'ordre des arts et des lettres de France, commander of the British Empire, Polish gold order of merit and the freedom of &#321;&#243;d&#378;, and professor emeritus of European cultural studies at Kingston University. Of course, I am particularly pleased that he is a fellow cavaliere della Repubblica Italiana.</p><p>Richard Demarco is a Scot, a Scots-Italian, a European and an internationalist whose worth is recognised the world over. His current work with the foundation and archive has been recognised by the University of Z&#252;rich and Washington State University, as well as by educational institutions from Blackhall primary school in Edinburgh to the Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance in Kent.</p><p>That brings me neatly to the educational resource that is the archive, most of which is currently housed in Craigcrook castle in Edinburgh. The castle might be said to be an ideal location. It has had a great history, not least during the 19th century, when it was used for literary soir&#233;es attended by Scott, Dickens, Eliot and Hans Christian Andersen. It was the home of Francis Jeffrey, editor of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>.</p><p>I used the word \"currently\", because Craigcrook is just one of the locations that has been used for the archive over the years. I am in awe of the tenacity and dedication of Richard Demarco and his team in keeping this national resource together. The archive has not benefited from local or national funding but has been maintained by <place-holder colnum=\"28804\"/> people who have a love of art and who recognise its importance to Scotland and to the family of nations to which Scotland belongs. Richard says that art is a language that links everything. The archive is a unique resource that links Scotland and Europe through many artists: Abakanowicz, Mach, Beuys, Maclennan, Yule and countless others.</p><p>What a gift to the Scottish nation. What an opportunity for a national institution to cherish and maintain. It is sad that if we are to keep the archive housed it might be necessary to sell some of its assets&#8212;unless something is done. I am glad that the Minister for Culture and External Affairs acknowledged the archive's importance and worth when she visited Craigcrook recently, by assigning officers to look into the funding of archivists. I am sure that she recognises the importance of keeping the Demarco archive in Scotland and I look forward to hearing her response to the debate. Richard Demarco might be only 80 years young, but he should be able to devote himself to promoting and enjoying the archive, rather than having to spend so much time raising money to maintain it.</p><p>When Richard Demarco is honoured later this year by the opening of the Royal Scottish Academy exhibition that will mark his 80th birthday, the collection at Craigcrook will be complementary to the exhibition at the national gallery. I hope that some security for the archive can be achieved now that it has received long-overdue recognition.</p><p>I urge everyone here and beyond to attend the RSA exhibition, which opens at the end of November and runs through to January. I also urge everyone to visit Craigcrook castle and the imminent exhibition of artists associated with the history of the Traverse gallery, the Demarco gallery and the Demarco European Art Foundation from the 1960s to 2010. I had to take a deep breath to say that long title, which reflects Richard Demarco's long career.</p><p>It was difficult to begin this speech, and it is difficult to end it. I have already made it clear how highly I regard Richard Demarco in a professional sense, but my motivation for requesting this debate to honour his birthday was personal as much as professional. He is quite simply one of the most inspiring and delightful human beings I have ever had the pleasure of knowing and spending time with. My respect for him is immense. He has travelled many roads.

Its points about resource availability are important in the context of the massive cuts in budget that the Scottish Parliament faces, which will reduce our ability to deliver for our communities, including on the provision of much-needed new housing.</p><p>The cuts flow directly from UK Government action to reduce the public sector deficit, and the CIH discussion pieces remind us that, despite Labour's 13 years in power, the UK still uses a definition of public expenditure that counts more housing expenditure in public sector net borrowing than is the case in most of the European countries with whose deficits the UK's is being compared. The CIH has campaigned on the issue for years. The previous UK Government understood the issue at an intellectual level but chose to do nothing about it, which has a bearing on the impending cuts. Perhaps the minister will raise the issue with the current UK Government, to ascertain whether there can be movement on it.</p><p>I move on to the role of co-operative and mutual models in delivering good-quality housing. After a discussion in the Scottish Parliament cross-party group on co-operatives, the minister and I visited a housing co-op in Easterhouse to meet representatives of the sector. It is clear that a great deal can be done in Scotland and in Westminster to strengthen the role of housing co-ops. It is worth recalling that the Monks co-operative commission, which Tony Blair established and which reported in 2001, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is currently no legal framework in UK housing law in which rights of occupancy of residential property can arise from membership of a democratic mutual provider.\"</p><p>The absence of a legal framework for co-operative housing is part of a wider neglect of the mutual sector in the UK. Since the Monks commission reported, some of the most significant developments in the legal framework have been taken through Westminster through private members' bills. How can we expect wider society to take co-operative and mutual models seriously, when Governments seem so uninterested in their operation? Mary Mulligan had a go at the minister about housing associations; I find puzzling and shameful Labour Governments' neglect of the mutual sector and, in particular, co-operative housing.<place-holder colnum=\"28607\"/></p><p>The sector has suffered from a serious lack of backing from Government and it has faced a number of obstacles&#8212;intended or unintended&#8212;to its growth. There is the unhelpful division between fully mutual and so-called non-mutual co-operatives, which appears to be driven by the tax regime but feeds through to all aspects of regulation. Government-supported mechanisms for rented housing and owner occupation have historically inhibited the development of mixed-tenure co-operatives, and differing treatment of housing providers has disadvantaged co-operatives that deal with people in housing need compared with providers that are registered as charities. As the minister knows, an advance since devolution has been the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator's decision to allow housing co-operatives to register as charities. He will also be aware, as many members are, that the approach is threatened by the Calman proposals. I would welcome his comments on the matter.</p><p>A recurring theme in the many debates that there have been on housing policy has been the need for communities to be empowered to make choices about how they want their housing to be provided and run. People who have wanted to choose the co-operative model have found that the obstacles are far too difficult to overcome, so their choice has been limited. In my experience, few communities are more empowered than communities that have a well-functioning housing co-operative. It is a pity that, after so many years of Labour administration in Scotland and in Westminster, we do not have more housing co-operatives in Scotland.</p><p>The minister has acknowledged the need. For the first time in the Scottish Parliament, housing co-operatives have been mentioned as a viable proposition in discussion papers on housing. I remember a time far back when I was a member of a parliamentary committee with responsibility for housing and I tried to get co-operatives recognised in legislation, only to be voted down by Labour members.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997167", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will focus mainly on an issue that has been overlooked for far too long by UK Governments and previous Administrations in Scotland: housing co-operatives.

It is a worthwhile topic. I am sorry that, unlike her, I was unable to attend the launch of the there for them campaign, which I understand was very successful. The award that was given by the <em>East Kilbride News</em> was well deserved. That was the first time that I had come across SAVI and Annmarie Campbell, its founder. I have since visited the office in East Kilbride and, like Margaret Mitchell, I have been impressed by the work that is being done there and the absolute commitment of the volunteers. I do not have much to add to what Margaret Mitchell said&#8212;she has covered all the bases&#8212;but I will raise some specific issues.</p><p>It must be borne in mind that it is only comparatively recently that society has started to discuss openly the fact that child abuse happens within and outwith families and the huge psychological effect that it has on the victims and those who are close to them. It is quite daunting for families to have to deal with such an issue on their own or with help from social work departments, health boards and institutions. Therefore, it is very important that there is now an organisation in Lanarkshire that is staffed by people who have had direct experience of dealing with such sensitive issues.</p><p>I was hugely impressed by the informality that is apparent at SAVI and the knowledge and commitment of the volunteers. I understand that there are now 23 volunteers on a waiting list for training, which shows the recognition of the issues among people who want to help and do the best that they possibly can.</p><p>I was impressed by the manner in which SAVI deals with clients and those who come along for a chat. The service is described as non-directive but holistic, and it aims to create an atmosphere in which people almost feel at home and have <place-holder colnum=\"27368\"/> confidence in those who are counselling them and offering support.</p><p>I was interested to learn about the effect that such abuse can have on people, and the way in which it manifests itself, whether that is through eating disorders, substance or alcohol abuse or self-harm. I learned about the importance of practical things such as housing: where people stay and the type of support that they get. The befriending element is important, because everyone who has been through a traumatic experience needs friends, and it can take quite a while for someone to build up those relationships again when they have a natural distrust of those around them.</p><p>SAVI has noted some key issues that require to be addressed. One major issue, to which Margaret Mitchell referred, is the time that elapses between an incident being reported and the start of the trial process. I understand that the Crown Office has been trying to address the matter, but the reality is that those cases are simply not being fast-tracked.</p><p>Court processes need to be managed to ensure that people feel confident in working their way through the system. The buddying element of what SAVI does is extremely important in that regard. I learned about schools, and how difficult it is for someone who has been abused in that way to try to fit back into the school system when their whole way of thinking about life has changed.</p><p>I see that time has moved on quickly&#8212;there is so much to say on this subject. I will finish by saying that although we talk a great deal about the voluntary sector&#8212;the third sector, as it is sometimes called&#8212;being very precious in dealing with various issues, the experience of groups such as SAVI is very important in dealing with this particular issue. SAVI is the only service in South Lanarkshire that offers this type of support. I would like the health board and the local authority to recognise the value of such a service, and to have detailed discussions with the volunteers at SAVI on how we can all move forward in the best interests of those who need this type of service.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20850644", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sexual Assault Victims Initiative East Kilbride"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Margaret Mitchell for bringing the issue to the chamber tonight.

Less than three months ago, my colleague Jamie Hepburn led a members' business debate on and praised the work of the Airdrie Savings Bank. I echoed that praise in my speech that day, and I will add to it now. Jim Lindsay, the chief executive of the Airdrie Savings Bank, has done an excellent job of keeping that bank on the straight and narrow. He and his staff have stuck to their guns over the years, and they maintain the proud traditions of Scottish banking&#8212;prudence, care and good relationships with customers.</p><p>Credit unions, too, have forged fine paths of fiscal rectitude, and their work should be encouraged, while we seek to maintain proper regulation, so that they do not head off the same cliff as the American savings and loan institutions. The success of credit unions should encourage us to examine other models of mutuality. What about the return of the Trustee Savings Bank, or truly mutual building societies? It was those proud traditions of banking that served us well in the past. Surely, as Iain Smith said, that is the purpose of banking, rather than the pursuit of profit purely for shareholder gain.</p><p>I contend that things might have been markedly different had those guiding principles been carried through in the regulation of the UK's financial services industry. Our banking system was <place-holder colnum=\"26832\"/> severely damaged by the decision in 1997 to establish the reactive FSA. It was and is an organisation unsuited to the task that it was handed, lacking in-depth knowledge of the bodies that it was to regulate and lacking the respect of the client institutions.</p><p>The collapse of England's Northern Rock bank was precipitated by the first major run on a bank in the UK for more than a century. Those who were running banks such as Northern Rock&#8212;including the chief executives and non-executive boards of RBS and HBOS, global banks based in Scotland&#8212;were swimming with the tide, viewing banking as the pursuit of profit and the delivery of results for shareholders. They did it remarkably well. However, that lack of responsibility should have been countered by the regulators, so that swimming with the tide did not have to mean drowning at the end. They failed. The lack of regulatory skill did much damage to our banks.</p><p>It is noticeable, however, that the Clydesdale Bank, for example, chuntered along quite well throughout the storm&#8212;it is part of the National Australia Bank group, and Australian and Canadian banks remained fairly well regulated throughout, avoiding the worst of the damage that banks in other nations suffered. Japanese banks also did better than might have been expected, because their regulation had been tightened up in the wake of the collapse of the 1990s. We might have thought that lessons had been learned.</p><p>When the committee began its inquiry, it noted that it wanted to consider how to ensure that such a crisis could not be allowed to happen again. There will always be banking crises of one sort or another, but we should take steps to ensure that such a crisis cannot be precipitated by such irresponsibility. We must make it perfectly clear to the banks that consider themselves to be too globally interconnected and too big to be allowed to fail that their current subsidy-junkie status is a temporary one-off.</p><p>We should take some financial services under our control. Discussions are going on around the world, among nations, between continents and internally within states. It is important that we make the sector work for the greater good of society at home as well as internationally. SNP members have long favoured the introduction of a currency exchange tax and I am pleased that the move towards a Tobin tax continues. Some 350 economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Jeffrey Sachs, recently wrote to leaders of the G20 nations to suggest that such a mechanism be given recognition.</p><p>We need a better model for Scotland's banking industry and financial sector in general. We also need to consider the worth of the banks, insurance companies and other financial services in the <place-holder colnum=\"26833\"/> sector. With help from the Scottish Government, the sector has begun to grow again. There are 1,500 new jobs in Glasgow and Edinburgh with Tesco Personal Finance and the insurance company, esure. More than half of Scotland's financial services companies will recruit this year and three quarters of them are optimistic about the future.</p><p>There is a lot to change and improve in Scotland. There is a lot to put right. Of course there is; no one denies that. However, Scotland has the strength to rebuild and to become stronger. There is a lot of good stuff going on in Scotland and we should praise the people who are doing the good stuff and help them to build on that success. We should hold on to the fact that Scotland can come out of this UK mess stronger than she was when she went in.</p><p>The committee's report is valuable and worth while.

It is worth discussing the relationships between the UK Government and the Scottish Government, so the debate is welcome.</p><p>The political landscape here at home certainly changed in May 2007, when the Scottish National <place-holder colnum=\"26642\"/> Party formed the Government. However, it should be noted that change also took place in Wales, where a governing coalition was formed between Plaid Cymru and the Labour Party, and in Northern Ireland, where the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein share power. Those arrangements were a big shift in democratic political representation because, for the first time, not all parts of the UK were ruled by the same political party. Since 1999, it was often said that the true mark of devolution in Scotland would be when a different party from the London party was in control, and no doubt the same was said about the Welsh Assembly. I believe that the shift in UK politics started then, and that that change continues, with the coalition Government in Westminster and the proposed changes in the electoral system. After all, to paraphrase, this is a process, not an event.</p><p>I welcome the respect agenda that is being talked about in relation to relationships between our Government and the UK Government, and I trust that the joint ministerial committee system will now work with an ethos of mutual respect for ministers of all Administrations.

We should never forget the horrors of world war two. Folk in my generation&#8212;and Stewart Maxwell's and Murdo Fraser's&#8212;cannot possibly imagine the horror of being directly involved in a war of that magnitude, or indeed the joy and relief that came at the end, on VE day. Stewart Maxwell has referred to the memories of people in Clydebank and elsewhere. The services that are required in the aftermath of war are intense. We cannot imagine the horror and what it does to people. Psychological support is obviously needed. That is as valid today, with our armed forces still at war, as it was on VE day.</p><p>Angela Constance recently secured a members' business debate that is relevant to this debate, on veterans in the criminal justice system. Stewart Maxwell mentioned some figures, which more than suggest that issues remain in that regard. Reference has been made to the campaign in the Parliament this week for signatures to a petition&#8212;I understand that the members of the Equality for Veterans Association will be in the Parliament <place-holder colnum=\"26116\"/> again tomorrow, fighting for pensions equality for all veterans, regardless of when they served in HM forces. I had heard about the campaign before, but I was shocked to discover the extent of the problem. All that those people are doing is seeking justice for people who left the forces before 1975 with less than 22 years' service, who, I was amazed to learn, do not qualify for any military pension. Like Stewart Maxwell, I urge people to sign the EFVA petition.</p><p>Many people served with great honour during world war two, and their efforts culminated in our ability to celebrate VE day. I pay tribute to one of the groups involved: the Territorial Army. The TA fights alongside the regular military in all conflicts. Having looked into the history a wee bit, I note that the TA was formed way back in 1908, when the voluntary army was combined with parts of the yeomanry and militia, which date back to the Napoleonic wars. The TA was first mobilised to fight in the first world war, serving alongside the regulars. We should never forget that the lives of those in the TA are also on the line. In 1939, as war approached, the size of the TA was doubled, and it was mobilised when hostilities broke out. It was reconstituted, in the form that we know now, in 1947, as a part-time reservist force.</p><p>The TA currently provides about 1,200 troops each year to support the regular Army in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. The TA does extremely important work&#8212;and none more so than the signal squadrons. I am pleased that 51 signal squadron (V) troop is based in the constituency where I live&#8212;I must find out whether that V stands for 5. I have visited the troop many times. The TA in East Kilbride is very much part of the community, with open days and other forms of support for the cadets.</p><p>Among the components of the TA's success have always been the good will, support and encouragement that it gives to young people in the communities where it is present. Tribute must also be paid to the employers who support their employees who do TA service. It is the willingness of employers to champion the men and women of the volunteer reserve force that makes the TA's role possible.</p><p>The TA's role is huge and does not just involve front-line fighting alongside the regular troops. The signal regiment, for example, provides vital communications support for emergency services during times of crisis. The regiment responds to terrorist threats and attacks, flooding, industrial action and outbreaks of disease. The TA uses some of the most up-to-date communications and information technology equipment.</p><p>There is no time in this speech&#8212;or even in the entire debate&#8212;to begin to pay tribute to all those who contributed to our ability to celebrate VE day <place-holder colnum=\"26117\"/> in the manner that Stewart Maxwell discussed, or to repay the debt that we still owe them all. Let us not forget that there are still people heading out from this country to the front line&#8212;to war&#8212;who are putting their lives on the line for the rest of us. We owe them such gratitude.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: VE Day (65th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Stewart Maxwell on securing the debate.

Before it comments on construction, the report mentions</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The emerging positive outlook evident in Scottish business in the second half of 2009\"</p><p>and the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"cautious optimism in the early months of this year.\"</p><p>The Scottish Chambers of Commerce indicated some of the things that have been causing problems, such as the severe winter weather and VAT going back up to 17.5 per cent. Neither of those things happened as a result of a Scottish Government policy.</p><p>The report makes it clear that one of the biggest cost pressures on Scottish businesses and one of their heaviest burdens is transport costs. Labour's fuel tax hikes have hit Scottish businesses hard and are becoming a major problem in Scotland. Jobs will be lost in our economy unless those rises are reversed.</p><p>Another SCC publication, \"Down to Business in 2010\", says:<place-holder colnum=\"25573\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Government must avoid tax increases that could penalise wealth creation or complicate the overall tax system. The planned increases in National Insurance Contributions will make it more expensive to take on new employees at a time of rising unemployment. We urge politicians of all parties to reverse this as soon as possible.\"</p><p>Mr Kerr's motion refers to the construction industry. The detail in the section on the construction industry in the report that is mentioned shows that the sector is less pessimistic about the future than it was a year ago, and that 20 per cent of construction companies are recruiting new staff. Andy Kerr claims that nearly 30,000 Scottish construction jobs have gone. The latest Office for National Statistics labour market statistics show that 7,000 construction jobs were lost in Scotland during the final year of the Labour-Lib Dem coalition, which was, I understand, a time of boom. Some 16,000 construction jobs have been lost in the past three years, at a time when Labour's recession has hit us all hard. Becoming unemployed is hard for anyone, and the struggle to get back into work is an individual challenge that should never be underestimated, but it is clear to me that Scottish Government policies and actions have worked to reduce the number of Scottish construction workers who are losing their jobs, and that the continuing actions of the Government should help them to get back into work. Those efforts have not been helped and nor will they be by Labour talking down Scotland, its economy and construction industry. Not only are Andy Kerr's figures wrong, his dismissal of Scottish workers is wrong too.</p><p>The Scottish Building Federation writes a lot about Scottish construction, which is its business and its blood.

The opening of the Aurora house will be welcomed by members of all parties.</p><p>Just before the Copenhagen conference on climate change, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth came to South Lanarkshire College in East Kilbride for the second time&#8212;he had been there to cut the first turf for the great initiative that I am talking about. On that day, Mr Swinney officially opened Scotland's first affordable low-energy, low-carbon house. The Aurora house has an A-rated energy certificate, a heat recovery system, thermal energy pumps and the capacity to create more electricity than it uses. Great congratulations are due to the college and all the partners who have been involved in the fantastic initiative.</p><p>The Aurora house was a great conception, in particular when we consider that it will be used as a training facility for students and apprentices who aim to work in the construction industry. South Lanarkshire College has a good record in everything that it teaches and is involved in, particularly construction. Not long ago the college successfully hosted the skillbuild 2009 competition, in which two of its students, Douglas Robertson and Stephen Butler, won medals for carpentry and roof slating and tiling respectively. <place-holder colnum=\"24363\"/></p><p>The college deserves much praise for its achievements, particularly since it moved into its new campus in the centre of East Kilbride. I praise in particular Ian Macpherson, the chairman, who oversaw the project; Stewart McKillop, the principal; Angus Allan, the depute principal; and their team of staff. Special commendation goes to the construction skills team at the college.</p><p>I will get back to the Aurora house. It is a flagship project that gives Scotland the potential to become a world leader in building a new generation of affordable low-carbon homes, thereby helping to combat climate change and addressing fuel poverty, which is hugely important in this day and age. Scotland is leading the way not only in climate change legislation, but in methods of delivering what is in that legislation.</p><p>The Aurora house is the result of a successful and unique partnership between South Lanarkshire College, Dawn Homes&#8212;part of the Dawn Group, which is made up of Dawn Construction, Dawn Homes and Dawn Development&#8212;and more than 50 private sector partners. The design of the house is also very important because that design has not been compromised by the building's functionality, so I will mention the architects: Jewitt Arschavir and Wilkie Architects.</p><p>The house showcases low-energy technologies and high insulation levels, is capable of reducing energy use and energy bills to zero, while contributing to the challenging Government targets to reduce greenhouse gases and carbon emissions. The house exceeds the building standards requirements that it is recommended should come into force in 2013 and then in 2016-17, so it is a blueprint for eco-friendly house construction, with the added bonus of being a training facility, that is unique in the United Kingdom, for teaching students the principles behind low-energy buildings.</p><p>It is one of the few houses to be built that easily achieves an A rating, which is the highest possible energy performance rating. When we consider that most older housing achieves only a D rating, and that most new build housing achieves only a C rating, we can see that the house is very special and something to which others can aspire.</p><p>It is a great initiative. A sensible design approach was adopted in the design of the timber frame, the placement of the windows and the inclusion of the heat recovery units and rainwater harvesting system. The house has photovoltaic panels, solar hot-water panels, an air-heat recovery system, ground-source heat exchanger, and one third of the air leakage of a typical new house. There are energy-saving light tunnels on the upper floor and water-saving sinks and baths. <place-holder colnum=\"24364\"/></p><p>When it is operational, the house will be net zero carbon.</p><p>We are talking about a four-bedroom detached house, but it is fully scalable and will allow smaller and larger properties in semi-detached or terraced styles to be produced as the market demands. I have limited time to speak, but I have many fact sheets with me. It would take a whole afternoon to fully extol the benefits of the project for learning and the economy, so if anyone wants to learn more about it, I have all the information available.</p><p>I would like to mention Dawn Construction here&#8212;of course, I mean Dawn Homes, but I have always known it as Dawn Construction&#8212;which has gained a proud record over many years of housing rehabilitation and now new-build housing. The company looked at and adapted the house because it realised that future discerning home buyers will prefer energy-efficient properties to those that are less energy efficient. The Aurora project has allowed Dawn Homes and its operatives to learn the complexities of what is required in the design of such a house, so that it can make an affordable and replicable product that will exceed Government targets. Dawn Homes has had the learning experience, and its workforce is learning new and different skills, which, through South Lanarkshire College, will allow the workforce of the future to learn new skills. It also means that a company has done some very innovative thinking and has now placed itself in the right place to accelerate out of the current recession and to be successful at the other end of it. That ethos of innovation must be congratulated.</p><p>Yesterday afternoon we had a debate about community regeneration; the Aurora house is a great example of that. It involved the college and learning, skills development and employment, along with all the agencies that worked together, including South Lanarkshire Council, which helped with building regulations and so on. It involved good design, but most important for regeneration of the community, it gave pride in achievement. Everyone who was involved in the Aurora house project can be proud of their achievement.

When Patricia Ferguson spoke about it in January or February 2007, she spoke about the status being serious and enduring. The current Government has also spoken about seriousness and said that the designation must be meaningful. We should hold on to that. Being a fair trade nation is about more than just the products that are bought in shops and having Fairtrade towns, councils and schools; it is about carrying on lobbying Westminster and Europe&#8212;and the Scottish Government, to an extent&#8212;to ensure that work that can be done through procurement and other big things continues to be embraced.</p><p>After an event that Bill Wilson and I attended a couple of months ago, he lodged a motion about ethical procurement in the national health service.

We must empower communities, which brings me back to the volunteers that I mentioned&#8212;the people who know what is best for their area.</p><p>Mistakes were made in the past in the planning of communities. The peripheral estates that started to appear in the middle of the previous century tore the heart out of communities. Lots of houses were created, but there was no infrastructure that would enable people to feel that they were part of something. It is certain that the architectural and planning communities have learned from those mistakes and are now talking about place making. That is not just another term that is loosely thrown about. We missed the importance of place over the decades and we must get our heads round what it means. Communities that feel that they are part of something have a sense of security, of belonging, of history and of continuity.</p><p>We have started to rectify the mistakes of the past in our approach to inner-city regeneration. For example, we are rehabilitating existing tenements. Members talked about housing associations and community ownership. Housing co-operatives are a model that offers tenants truly democratic empowerment&#8212;another word that we like to use a lot&#8212;and control of the housing stock that they occupy. That gives people an incentive to make their area thrive. Co-ops, whether they are fully mutual or not, are not just experts in housing; they are involved in community facilities, training and employment and public art, whose value to communities is often ignored but is extremely important.</p><p>There are great models of co-ops around, whether the South Lanarkshire Council one in West Whitlawburn, Easthall Park Housing Co-operative in Glasgow or Tenants First Housing Co-operative in Aberdeen. Those organisations, which are volunteer led, are truly working within their communities towards what we keep calling regeneration.</p><p>I am delighted that the Government and the minister recognise the value of the housing co-operative as a social and economic model around which communities can be built. As the minister said, we have had so many initiatives: the GEAR, the cities growth fund and then the town centre regeneration fund. Some successful work was done under the latter fund. The North Lanarkshire town centres received more than &#163;2 million for a worthwhile cause and East Kilbride &amp; District Shopmobility received &#163;100,000 for soft play and the sustainability of the organisation.</p><p>The sustainability of communities is at the heart of this debate. It is not just about pumping in money through some new initiative then cutting the initiative off because it has been successful <place-holder colnum=\"24149\"/> and looking for something else. It is about sustainability and continued growth.</p><p>In my last minute, I will consider the new towns as an example of what has been carried out. I am fortunate to represent two new towns: Cumbernauld and East Kilbride. East Kilbride is held up as Scotland's most successful new town&#8212;it is certainly the oldest one, having been established in 1947. It works in the place making sense that I talked about. Part of the reason why it works is that the new town was built round an existing community, albeit a small village community&#8212;East Kilbride village&#8212;with a recognition of the rural community that was round about the area. Its wonderful history&#8212;I commend Mr Bill Niven, our East Kilbride local historian, who documents it all well&#8212;gave the town the important sense of place, the security of belonging and the sense of continuity that define a sustainable place that people feel proud of and want to make and keep successful.</p><p>My plea for today is that we recognise that people need places where they feel comfortable and happy.

He accused the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth of \"deception\"; I suggest that the deception comes directly from Andy Kerr's colleague at the Scotland Office. The Scotland Office's report was entirely selective in its statements, with a lack of balance and analysis but much imagination. It excluded large chunks of the revenue that is gathered from Scotland, but managed to lever in expenditure that did not actually occur. It also excluded council tax revenue but included local authority expenditure, thereby creating a phantom gap in Scotland's accounts.</p><p>There are other anomalies and analytical failings in the Scotland Office document, as there are in the posturings of the Labour group here today. I emphasise my disappointment at the fact that the Secretary of State for Scotland, supposedly <place-holder colnum=\"23385\"/> Scotland's man in the Westminster Cabinet, rather than the other way round, would wish to tell the people whom he represents&#8212;the people of Scotland&#8212;that they are not paying their way, that they are subsidy junkies and that they are too poor or stupid to be let out alone. I find that sad and strange and I ask whether the Secretary of State for Scotland is a little out of touch with some of his colleagues here, who have clearly grasped that perpetual negativity is in no one's interests, either individually or collectively.</p><p>Two weeks ago, I said that we must think about how changes to public spending will change the economic and social outlook of our country. There must be a rethinking of the priorities of Scottish public spending, and every politician in Scotland will have to think hard about what they want to do. The sums of money that all of us wish were available for distribution are not in the budget. Every member of the Parliament would want more money to be available for public services, even if we disagree in some measure about how to spend the funds. The point is that we are where we are and must take the appropriate decisions.</p><p>As we know, the cab sec has taken decisions that he thinks are appropriate. I note the decision that he has taken on the boiler scrappage scheme and on Sarah Boyack's motion in the <em>Business Bulletin</em>, which was signed by every member of the Labour group, calling for that. John Swinney has delivered, yet we still hear from the Labour group that it will not vote for the budget. What do we have to do to get some degree of positive outlook from the Labour group? We have a limited pot of money to use. The cabinet secretary has done the best possible job of apportioning the resources in the budget.</p><p>There has been constructive dialogue with some colleagues from other parties, but sadly not with the front bench of the Labour group, which has lodged an amendment calling for the reinstatement of GARL. I ask those who intend to support that amendment&#8212;from Jeremy Purvis's speech, it seems that Lib Dems intend to do so&#8212;to consider and to reflect further on two things. As my colleague Kenny Gibson mentioned, the original feasibility study by SKM, which was published during the term of the previous Administration, was not convinced of the perceived benefits of GARL&#8212;in fact, it was quite damning in some regards. I suggest that members look at that study.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20544402", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 4) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A fortnight ago, we passed stage 1 of the budget.

The cabinet secretary promised &#163;1.6 billion over three years for housing, and that is what we got. When the ill winds of recession blew north from London, it was John Swinney who argued that we needed an acceleration of capital spending to keep the worst of the wolves from Scotland's door, and he got it. That is why housing spend was higher in the previous budget than it is in this one. The Scottish Government was protecting Scottish jobs by accelerating spend.</p><p>If Mr Swinney had had his way, there would have been further acceleration of capital spend this year, with associated housing expenditure. Credit must be given to Iain Gray for backing the cabinet secretary's call to London. Sadly, it was to no avail: as we learned, the chancellor was less agreeable and the request was denied.

We must face reality and, like every family in this country that faces straitened circumstances in the recession, we have to make serious decisions about what we should spend our money on.

Their work has obviously been hard because the commission report refers to the lack of empirical data on the subject on which to accurately base measurement and comparison and it cites data from the range of sources that it used. It has not been an easy job to pull the report together.</p><p>Regardless of what people think of the detail in the commission's report, it certainly shows that we should not be complacent, but, a bit like Christina McKelvie, I do not believe that we should put out a message of doom and failure either. As Cathy Jamieson and others mentioned, since 1999 this Parliament has recognised the importance of education incorporating functional literacy from nursery schooling right through to lifelong learning. <place-holder colnum=\"22750\"/></p><p>Indeed, in 2006 when the OECD followed up its 2001 international adult literacy survey, the Scotland background paper noted the learning opportunities accessed by adults in Scotland, which prompted envious praise from practitioners in England.</p><p>We must have balance in our discussions and in our terminology. As Rhona Brankin pointed out, too often people understand the phrase \"functional illiteracy\" to mean that people cannot read or write a word or a sentence. The terminology gives a false impression of the subject under discussion. However, we have to recognise the disadvantages that deep-seated functional illiteracy brings to individuals of all ages. As was ably outlined by Hugh Henry, it brings great disadvantages to individuals, families, groups and communities. Hugh Henry referenced the Dugdale and Clark study, which looked in great detail at the effects of community illiteracy. That leads directly to the introductory paragraph to the commission's recommendations and its call to recognise that socioeconomic issues are the main underlying cause of illiteracy and the need for programmes to address those problems.</p><p>Socioeconomic issues underpin so many problems in our society, right across the board: in the areas of justice, education, attainment and many others. Many programmes over many decades have purported to address those problems. I must be getting on a bit because I can think back to urban aid programmes, social inclusion partnerships and so on. As others have said, those programmes have not always been hugely successful. The Labour motion mentions pilot schemes and I make two pleas in that regard. The first is that although a pilot scheme cannot be long term, it should look at long-term solutions to address the problems, which are deep-seated, as Hugh Henry said earlier. We should not undertake pilot schemes, walk away from them and then come up with another initiative; something sustainable has to be done.

Sadly that did not happen, but I hope that the campaign continues by both the Scottish Government and the Labour group.</p><p>I will address a couple of points that members have raised. Wendy Alexander talked about the Scotland-based banks. Scotland is, unfortunately, currently part of the UK, so international banks are based in Scotland in that context. We keep hearing the accusation that Scotland could not have afforded to bail out the banks on its own, but the straight truth is that the UK could not afford to do so, either. We should include Northern Rock among those banks&#8212;it is not just the Scotland-based banks that were bailed out. That massive increase in Government indebtedness will hang around the necks of future generations like a millstone&#8212;it is the fault of the UK Government and its regulatory failure.</p><p>I return to the topic of Scotland and the pre-budget report. The Scottish Government's economic recovery plan is good and it is useful; those points have been proven. There is much in the plan that supports business, and we had hoped that the pre-budget report would complement some of the plan because the small business bonus scheme in Scotland has been highly successful.</p><p>One thing that I welcome in the chancellor's pre-budget report is that the corporation tax issue has been deferred until 2011. That is good news in a <place-holder colnum=\"22216\"/> way, because it means that there will be another year before the drivers of Scotland's economy are hit by it. However, the fact that it is happening at all is cause for concern, as is the rise in national insurance and its effect on business, which members have also mentioned today.</p><p>It is interesting to hear how eager the Labour group in the Scottish Parliament is to quote the Confederation of British Industry; these are changed days. However, I will quote the CBI back at Labour members. Richard Lambert, the CBI director general, said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Government had made a serious mistake imposing an extra jobs tax at a time when the economic recovery will still be fragile.\"</p><p>I have no idea why, if the chancellor is really interested in using business to stimulate the economy, he thinks that that is a good idea.</p><p>I have to admit that the following points suffer from a lack of detail from the chancellor, but I am also concerned about the extra &#163;500 million of credit that will be made available under the enterprise finance guarantee. As commentators throughout the country keep telling us, the banks are still not lending or operating the existing enterprise finance guarantee, even with the UK Government's assurances that the lending is covered. Indeed, I am sure that all MSPs have had evidence from small businesses in their areas that the system is simply not working properly. Perhaps the banks do not think that the Government is good for the money these days, but even the banks that are to all intents and purposes publicly owned are not following the Government's line and extending credit facilities to business. Perhaps the UK Government should use its position as majority shareholder in those banks to ensure that such credit, which will be used to stimulate the economy, is forthcoming.</p><p>I also note the announcement of a growth capital fund for businesses that cannot get credit. As a result, not only is the public purse standing guarantor for credit under the enterprise finance guarantee, but the Government is going to provide funds to businesses that the banks are refusing to give money to under the very guarantee that is about to receive an extra &#163;500 million of credit. All that smacks of chaos at the heart of the Treasury's attempts to address the economic turmoil, which I suggest again was partly caused by the lack of proper regulatory control of the financial markets.</p><p>I do not have time to say much more, but I certainly think that we need a lot more detail on the measures to control bankers' bonuses. The one-off tax on bonuses of more than &#163;25,000, which will be paid by the banks and not the individuals concerned, sounds a bit populist; it seems like a good idea that should raise some <place-holder colnum=\"22217\"/> money. However, Roy Maugham, tax partner at UHY Hacker Young, has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is one of the most easily dodged taxes in years. Almost all banks will be able to put off formal agreements on bonuses until after April. The ease with which this tax can be ducked raises the question of whether this is a political move to appease voters rather than a genuine attempt to raise money for the Treasury.\"</p><p>I share his concerns. The promises that we have been given lack a lot of detail, and I am sure that Parliament will agree that we need the same fiscal stimulus that the other G8 countries introduced. We are the only country that did not put in place such measures, and we are the only country that has yet to come out of recession. We must get together and keep making the argument to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8212;whoever he or she might be in a year or so&#8212;that the Scottish economy must be provided with the stimulus that it needs.

It is fascinating to see who is taking part. The world march was a humanist proposal, but people of various belief systems&#8212;people of religious faith or of no faith&#8212;and pacifists and non-pacifists are coming together to say, \"Enough. What is happening in our world today is ridiculous. There is too much violence of all sorts.\" That is not as simple as if it were just about nuclear weapons; it encompasses the world. We find that more civilians are being killed in conflicts than ever before, because of the changing nature of war. We have Governments that actively carry out what I would say are terrorist acts against their own populations in order to do no more than maintain control.</p><p>I am really pleased that Bill Kidd managed to bring the beacon of peace to Scotland, which is so important. For all that we have a military history, which we talk a lot about, we also have a good history of peaceful reconciliation and of finding ways forward in conflict resolution.</p><p>I often think that Scotland is in a great position, particularly since the Parliament reconvened more than 10 years ago, to take a bit of a lead in such issues. We are a small nation that is in the process of re-establishing itself through self-government, but we should never underestimate the fact that we have achieved significant constitutional change in a totally peaceful and democratic fashion. For all that we shout and bawl at each other and take stances in here, we should never underestimate what we have achieved. In today's world, which is a very dangerous place, that is to be lauded and applauded.</p><p>We should recognise the number of people from countries and legislatures throughout the world who come here to learn from this Parliament about <place-holder colnum=\"22177\"/> how those things can be achieved. In case I am accused of plagiarism, I should say at this point that I am referring to something that I wrote myself. We have had delegations from eastern Europe, Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa. A few years ago, this Parliament endorsed a visit by the Palestinian Legislative Council and agreed to share good practice. That is extremely important in today's world and very forward-looking for an institution that is as young as ours.</p><p>Scotland should be staking its place in Europe and the world and it should have the vision to promote peace and stability actively. Bill Kidd said that sometimes these aspirations are seen as a bit idealistic and naive. Elaine Smith said that, too, when she was promoting peace education during a debate in Parliament some time ago. As I said when we talked about the peace stone&#8212;the Sconestone&#8212;going around the world, if we cut off the roots to any kind of idealism, we will never advance and we will never get anywhere.</p><p>Our reputation for democratic and peaceful constitutional change means that we could be established in the world as a force in aiding conflict resolution. We can invite people here from overseas and provide a peaceful setting for mediation and negotiation. I cannot remember which countries were involved, but that was done a few years ago&#8212;I think that Angus Robertson headed it up&#8212;with some eastern European states that were suffering conflict at the time.</p><p>We can invite people here and we can send Scots outward, too, in the spirit of international co-operation and world stability.

It was established in 1999 because we had news of the dispersal of asylum seekers in Glasgow. The group was indeed cross party and members will excuse me if I name a few folk who were active in it: Sandra White, of course, James Douglas-Hamilton, Donald Gorrie, Elaine Smith and Tommy <place-holder colnum=\"21775\"/> Sheridan. There were others, and Patrick Harvie is the group's current convener.</p><p>Not just those members but most members, including the previous Executive, felt the same way about the issue. The current Government feels the same way. I remember that an attempt by Jack McConnell and Nicol Stephen to establish a protocol on dawn raids was scuppered by the then UK minister.</p><p>To that group of people I can add civic Scotland, churches, voluntary support groups, people who worked at Dungavel in various roles and even the locals in Strathaven, where I live. People came from all over the country to take part in vigils at Dungavel.</p><p>Scotland cares about the detention of children. Concern about the issue is not the preserve of a single person, group or political party. There is consensus: it is wrong to lock up children. It is wrong to lock up someone who has done no wrong, whatever their age, but locking up children is much worse. It is immoral, unethical and brutal to lock up a child, whether they are with one parent, two parents or unaccompanied&#8212;and to add to that experience the experience of seeing a parent in handcuffs.</p><p>The evidence of the effect on children is there for anyone to see, as a result of the pilot study at Yarl's Wood. I experienced particular horror when I read that one child reported the re-emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder. I have seen the effects of PTSD on someone close to me. How on earth can we justify inflicting such horror on a child in this country?</p><p>We all care and I suspect that we are all frustrated that despite the existence of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 there seems to be a little piece of Scotland&#8212;wherever an asylum seeker family happens to be&#8212;that is not Scotland and over which we have no jurisdiction.</p><p>Many people have tried to tackle the issue and there has been progress, but the last resort or exceptional circumstance criterion is not being applied. According to Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People, more than 100 children have been detained at Dungavel during the past year, so the detention of children is not an exceptional occurrence but a normal part of the process of deporting a family. The detention of children at Dungavel is limited to 72 hours, but a stay in Dungavel is often a precursor to a move to detention elsewhere in the UK. We send children who have been part of our community and sometimes have been born in Scotland away from Scotland and the people that they know, to be locked up.</p><p>There is no doubt that the UK Government is wrong to detain children. It is right that Scotland <place-holder colnum=\"21776\"/> stands against the detention of children.

Understandably, it has been very much centred on Edinburgh and the Lothians. I thought that I would redress the balance a wee bit and talk about what was done in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.</p><p>The first women's suffrage society in Glasgow was formed in 1870. Then there was the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage. As Christine Grahame said, that association soon became the Women's Social and Political Union and the breakaway, non-violent Women's Freedom League.</p><p>There was peaceful revolt, and some quite noisy revolt in Glasgow. The Glasgow suffragettes went down to London and took part in window-smashing raids in 1912. Dorothea Chalmers Smith was imprisoned for housebreaking with intent to set fire in Park Gardens in 1913. That took place in the culture of society in relation to women that some members have mentioned.</p><p>As we know, history always favours the victors. There is an awful lot of history in Scotland, the UK and Europe where the part played by women is not mentioned. Women were very active in all sorts of campaigns to make society a bit better. Looking back at the trades movement, for example, we can see the roots of the women's suffrage movement. Elspeth King wrote some really interesting stuff about the subject. She wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The weaving trade ... was totally female in Scotland\",</p><p>unlike in the north of England, where it consisted of men, women and children. Wages were consequently lower in Scotland.</p><p>The first women's strike took place as early as 1768, in Paisley. It was reported:<place-holder colnum=\"21707\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"a female combination ... has been entered into by the young women of this place ... who refuse to work, unless on higher wages.\"</p><p>And quite right, too. It was a woman weaver, I think in 1832, who called for the vote, and that takes me back to the radical uprising in 1820. We rightly talk about the men who suffered at that time, but there were women who were part of that movement, too, as can be seen in the progress that was made.</p><p>I know that there are women in the chamber who have read Marion Reid's book, \"A Plea for Women\". That book was way ahead of its time, and it is a reference that we should all look at often. It was first published in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century. Marion Reid spoke about the roles of men and women in society. I love the quote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the effects on men of an artificially inflated sense of their prerogatives are just as unfortunate as those of constant depreciation on women.\"</p><p>She was not just shouting about giving women rights; she recognised that those are human rights that have an effect on everyone in society. That is how it is: it is a human right to be treated the same as anyone else. As Johann Lamont said, with all this talk about positive discrimination, it is as if women are trying to get something very special that nobody else has. When one part of society holds the power, it is only right that society considers how to rebalance that power. Women do not hold the power in our society today.</p><p>I will end with a poem from another Glasgow woman, Marion Bernstein, written in 1876. She wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I dreamt that the nineteenth century<br/> Had entirely passed away<br/> And had given place to a more advanced<br/> And very much brighter day</p><p>For women's rights were established quite<br/> And man could the fact discern<br/> That he'd long be teaching his grandmamma<br/> What she didn't require to learn</p><p class=\"indent\">There were female chiefs in the Cabinet<br/> (Much better than males I'm sure!)<br/> And the Commons were three-parts feminine<br/> While the Lords were seen no more!\"</p><p>Although the intervening century and a quarter has thankfully seen our focus shift away from Westminster towards Holyrood, it is disappointing that, in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we still have not got as far as Marion Bernstein hoped for by the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. I hope that, as our Parliament develops, we will no longer need to measure the progress of women towards equality but will be able to take it as a given.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20411180", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Votes for Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Shirley-Anne Somerville on securing the debate.

The name of the campaign is extremely positive and reflects the fact that song is an important way to spread a message, particularly in places such as South Africa, which has a tradition of activist songs and singing. It is a way to create solidarity and communicate messages because people are encouraged and inspired by singing.</p><p>That is particularly important when we consider the stigma that AIDS and HIV have around the world. It is a big issue. There are communities in sub-Saharan Africa in which people are scared to be tested to find out whether they are HIV positive because of the stigma that it brings upon them. As Annie Lennox mentioned&#8212;and I emphasise&#8212;those with the best intentions can often inadvertently make that problem worse. Where particular religious persuasions have issues with some of the preventive measures that can be used to combat HIV, that becomes a big problem and the stigma becomes even worse.</p><p>I cannot remember the name of the group of visitors from Africa that I went along to listen to one day, but I was fascinated by them. They were a group of clerics&#8212;ministers&#8212;who were actively working in their respective villages to promote awareness of HIV and preventive measures. That is very important and it was very brave of those religious people to do that within their communities. It is to be welcomed.</p><p>Although she was inspired in Africa, Annie Lennox also talked about the situation here. It is a problem. We should never bury our heads in the sand, although, as Jack McConnell says, we are fortunate that we can manage the condition here. The HIV infection and AIDS quarterly report up to March this year said that, cumulatively, there were almost 6,000 HIV reports and 1,500 AIDS cases. It also said that the total number of deaths was 1,594.</p><p>I am pleased that the Government is taking action&#8212;Shona Robison, the Minister for Public Health and Sport, will speak about that in her response to the debate. It is extremely important that we have a much more co-ordinated approach to improve access to specialist HIV care and to prevent HIV transmission. It is also important that we get that co-ordination right.</p><p>Great stuff is being done all over Lanarkshire for world AIDS day on 1 December. There are awareness-raising events involving colleges, North <place-holder colnum=\"21543\"/> Lanarkshire Council, South Lanarkshire Council, general practitioners, dentists and pharmacists. I also mention the west Lanarkshire girl guides. Those young women have a link with Ghana and some of them hope to go out there next year. One thing that they want to talk about when they go is AIDS awareness. Young people relating to other young people across the globe can help to make a big difference.</p><p>I echo the call for the Parliament to take seriously Annie Lennox's offer to be in some way an ambassador for international development for the Parliament. We should never underestimate the impact that people such as Annie Lennox can have. She is known internationally; people love her and the way that she cares about the issue shines from her. We should back the sing campaign and the Parliament should seriously consider taking up that generous offer.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20410699", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World AIDS Day 2009"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jack McConnell on securing this important debate.

It is important that we all pay tribute to the fire prevention work that is being done by fire boards and Scotland's firefighters. The report makes it clear that there is a long-term downward trend in fire-related deaths in Scotland, and much of that must be due to the hard work of the fire boards and firefighters in preventing fires and persuading people to take responsibility for their own safety. The downward trend is also due to the continuing improvements in the fire service that have come about through hard work and continuous training. We should note that contribution to the overall health of our nation.</p><p>However, I pick up on John Lamont's comments, as did the FBU, about the lack of evaluation. Surely we can work towards changing that. I also understand that there is a problem to be addressed in the number of fires that are started deliberately and without concern for others. That must be addressed through the actions of a number of agencies such as our police forces, and the educational efforts of our fire boards.</p><p>Looking at the report, I see that there is a bit of an elephant in the room. According to the report, alcohol plays a part in 62 per cent of fire deaths across Scotland. Almost two thirds of all fire deaths are connected to the consumption of alcohol, as far as is known, but the figures might be underreported; in fact, the report speculates that the figure probably is underreported, because there is no requirement on fire investigators to look for evidence of alcohol consumption being related to fire deaths. The figures will report only when there is overwhelming evidence that alcohol consumption was a factor in the fire. We are left to speculate on what the true figure might be; Nigel Don also referred to that when he mentioned analysing the figures from the top of the pyramid down to the base.</p><p>I assume that there is no way of determining how many fatalities are caused by a fire that has no link to alcohol consumption. However, the effects of alcohol on a sleeping resident could have played a part in their death. Senses are dulled by alcohol and lack of awareness certainly precludes precipitate action.</p><p>I know that my colleague Stewart Maxwell will talk more about safety cigarettes, and they can help, but we do not have such things as safety chip pans, frying pans or toasters, for example.</p><p>In addition, the report deals with fire fatalities without taking into account injuries that are caused by fire. It might be rather interesting to see how the breakdown of figures shows up circumstances in which the fire does not result in a fatality. A whole load of injuries might be caused by fires, but we do not have a note of them today. It would be <place-holder colnum=\"21206\"/> instructive for us to have that information, so I encourage the minister to consider the possibility of pulling together more information to let us all see the extent of the problem.

I was intrigued, and I became even more so when, along with Neil Galbraith as the first keeper, I went to Hunter primary school in East Kilbride. Along with all the pupils, I learned more about the stone and how its sculptor Warren MacLeod, from Nova Scotia, was inspired.</p><p>Warren MacLeod lived in the north-east of Scotland for some time, and was fascinated by the neolithic carved stone orbs&#8212;more than 380 of them&#8212;that have been found there over the years. When Warren was given the bronze cast of the stone that had been found on the Brahn estate, just north of Inverness, he was hooked. He combined the concept of our 17<sup>th</sup> century Brahn seer with the neolithic orbs, and created the Sconestone, which is, I understand, currently in Austria.</p><p>The stone is a six-sided orb with three carved portals, each of which represents a view into the past, the present and the future. It represents wisdom: the wisdom to learn from the past, understand the present and plan for the future.<place-holder colnum=\"21093\"/></p><p>Today&#8212;November 11&#8212;is armistice day, when we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice. It is a day on which we remember the past and those who still serve in the present and, I hope, on which we consider a future that is free of war and conflict.</p><p>When Warren MacLeod spoke to Calum MacDonald of Runrig about the possibility of launching the stone at the band's homecoming Scotland 2009 concert in Scone, Calum suggested that it be called the Sconestone, which links it to the stone of destiny upon which the kings of the Picts and of Scotland were crowned. Warren liked that idea&#8212;he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"my stone is a new stone ... with a new destiny ... to go on a never-ending journey of kindness from hand to hand, keeper to keeper around the world.\"</p><p>That is simple, straightforward and inspiring, as many of the best ideas are.</p><p>The children at Hunter primary school were certainly inspired. They loved the story and the stone. Every one of them who was there that day touched, rubbed or held the stone and pledged to perform an act of kindness. They made a kindness tree to mark the day on which the stone visited their school. They endorsed entirely the ethos of the stone and they were delighted that such a beautiful object&#8212;essentially Scottish in form and symbolic values&#8212;was heading round the world. The stone is travelling round the world, to Nova Scotia, where the House of Assembly unanimously endorsed resolution No 683 in favour, to the United States, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Austria. It is only a little over two months since its launch.</p><p>The rules of the Sconestone are simple. Whoever is honoured to be the keeper must do at least one act of kindness; they must keep the stone for no more than seven days; they must encourage friends and strangers to touch the stone and pledge an act of kindness; and they must pass the stone to a person who can be trusted to honour its purpose.</p><p>I urge members to log on to the Sconestone.com website to track progress and see the marvellous initiatives that have been carried out by the keepers so far. I do not have time to detail them all, but I will mention a couple. In Hungary, the keeper, political correspondent Tamas Szalay, and the clown doctors took the stone to the Pen Heim children's hospital to spread magic and kindness. It went from there to a ceilidh at the Caledonia pub in Budapest, where I am sure that magic and kindness were further spread.</p><p>Franciscan brother Bojte Csaba, as keeper in Romania, spread the word about the needs of street children. So far, Brother Csaba's Saint <place-holder colnum=\"21094\"/> Francis Foundation in Transylvania has adopted and fostered almost 1,500 children. Sadly, that work still has a long way to go.</p><p>In New York, Barbara Mahon, the third keeper, took the stone to the 9/11 2009 gathering, where it was warmly received by the families, friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives eight years ago.</p><p>As I said, an inspiration to Warren MacLeod was that wisdom is to learn from the past, understand the present and plan for the future; the hope is that, all over the world, the Sconestone and its inherent ethos will further inspire. That is certainly the case here in Scotland, where the Rev Neil Galbraith is already working on a legacy plan. Many here will know the good work that Glasgow the Caring City has done in the provision of humanitarian assistance and care in more than 50 countries around the world&#8212;the charity provides care and support wherever there is a need.</p><p>The Rev Neil Galbraith's view&#8212;shared, I am sure, by all in the Parliament&#8212;is that here at home, in Scotland, there should be no such thing as child poverty. After all, Scotland's children deserve better. There is cross-party support for Glasgow the Caring City's cross out child poverty in Scotland initiative. I understand that the statement of intent, compiled by the Rev Neil Galbraith and Tom Harris MP, has been signed by the First Minister. Again, the aspirations are simple and straightforward. They include the statements that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"no society can be truly at ease with itself while significant numbers of children live in poverty\"</p><p>and that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the elimination of child poverty must be a priority for us all\"</p><p>because</p><p class=\"indent\">\"poverty corrodes children's health, their happiness, their safety and their aspirations.\"</p><p>Furthermore,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"only through the elimination of child poverty can we expect the children of Scotland to live their lives to the full, and to be able to enjoy the opportunities that the rest of society take for granted.\"</p><p>Those are only a selection of the statements from the Cathcart declaration. I am sure that members will be further informed about the initiative before too long. I urge everyone to support it.</p><p>All too often, initiatives such as the Sconestone and aspirations such as spreading kindness can be considered naive and, some would say, over idealistic. However, if the children of Hunter primary school in East Kilbride can be inspired and understand the concept of spreading good, so can adults from all walks of life. If the life of any one person in this world is cheered by the Sconestone, <place-holder colnum=\"21095\"/> it is worth while. If the legacy of the first keeper is to help eradicate child poverty in Scotland, we should all embrace the concept of using Scottish symbolism and values to stimulate acts of kindness. I learned earlier today that this week is world kindness week and that Friday is world kindness day.</p><p>Again, I thank members who are present for the debate. I hope that they will pledge to perform an act of kindness on Friday, which is world kindness day, and to pass the word to all those who were, unfortunately, unable to be present this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20370892", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: The Sconestone"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members who have signed the motion, and those who are in the chamber.

I was on the Transport and the Environment Committee at the time, and I think that I am right in saying that Sarah Boyack was the minister. I remember the general consensus on the designation of national parks. As Liam McArthur and Gil Paterson said, they were long overdue when one considers the international work of John Muir. As Sarah Boyack said earlier, it was essential to protect our outstanding landscape and heritage.</p><p>That worthy statement is so important because we do have outstanding landscapes and a wonderful heritage. I look at the principles and objectives of our two national parks as written and followed in the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. Those of the Cairngorms talk about conserving and enhancing biodiversity and landscapes, as well as sustainable deer management, which is very particular to that area. The Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park recognises that it represents some of Scotland's most iconic landscapes and reflects Scotland's identity through the natural and cultural heritage that it promotes and protects. So we start from a good base of what national parks are about.</p><p>However, as we have heard from the minister and others today, also behind the national park designations and their progress were issues such as the economic and social development of communities. Our national parks are about people, as well as wildlife and landscapes. We have heard today about the successes of both parks in that regard. For example, there is tourism and its inherent business, transport initiatives, training schemes and grant administration.</p><p>I know that there are concerns. Jamie McGrigor spoke about concerns about planning requirements. I hope that he takes comfort in and supports the measures that came into effect in August to create a more effective planning system in order to support economic recovery. Those measures will impact on the planning functions of national parks. The changes include the establishment of local review bodies so that councillors rather than the Scottish Government can review decisions about small-scale local developments. That change was introduced because, historically, a large volume of planning applications were routinely notified by planning authorities to ministers for consideration, but around 90 per cent of those applications did not require decisions to be taken at the national level.</p><p>The changes also mean that there is a requirement on developers to consult communities before they submit major development proposals. That is more important in our national parks than anywhere else. More information on planning decisions will also be made available. It is <place-holder colnum=\"20805\"/> extremely important that we consider those things in the round and the benefits that can be brought to our national parks as a result of them.</p><p>I was interested in what Jackie Baillie said about local occupancy conditions, which are an issue. That is one example that shows why it was important to recognise that the time was right for review. We can consider our experiences over the past nine years and try to make improvements for the future. A lot has happened in the nine years since the 2000 act was passed; it is time to review what has happened and implement measures. I therefore welcome the minister's statement. She outlined sensible measures, particularly the designation of a defined term for the ministerially chaired strategy group, so that it does not go on for ever. That is extremely important.</p><p>Rob Gibson's speech was interesting. We should never think that one solution fits all; rather, we should always consider what is best for local communities and how that will serve Scotland's national interest.</p><p>Over the decades, successive committees of inquiry, way back to the Ramsay committee in 1945, have recommended other locations for national parks. Different locations have been mooted over the years, including Glen Affric, Glen Cannich, Strathfarrar, Ben Nevis, Glencoe, Loch Torridon, Loch Maree and Loch Broom. As recently as February 2009, Harris in the Western Isles voted in a local referendum, by 732 votes to 311, to petition the Scottish Government for the parish area to be recognised as a national park. When he was the Minister for Environment, Michael Russell said that he would consider such a request if it had the community's support. I understand that the request is still open to consideration. There is a democratic element. That takes us back to what Rob Gibson talked about. The wish must come from the community. Things that are community driven are always more sustainable. We should never try to impose a model that has worked in one place on to somewhere else.</p><p>We have talked about the economic benefits of the parks, and I opened my speech by talking about the absolute requirement to protect our fabulous landscapes and heritage. However, we should not forget that our national parks can also be about fun and enjoyment. Indeed, the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority talks clearly about special places and co-ordinating the efforts of local communities and all the different sectors to deliver better integration of activities, the best use of resources and better results in terms of environmental, economic and social benefits. We should never underestimate the sense of wellbeing that being out and about in <place-holder colnum=\"20806\"/> our wonderful landscapes creates for people. That is important.</p><p>National parks are to be welcomed and I support our having the debate, which has been interesting. National parks are about sustainable development, biodiversity and economic development, but they are also about the health and wellbeing of the people of this nation. I return to what Chris Harvie said. I will not quote Gerard Manley Hopkins; rather, I will paraphrase him. We have all those things, but let us never forget the absolute joy and importance of preserving our wildernesses for future generations.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20287305", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It amazes me that it is nine years since the National   Parks (Scotland) Act 2000 was passed.

I have to say that, much as she is a cheery wee soul, she is looking even happier today than I have seen her looking for a long time. She is just beaming, which is a mark of the honesty and integrity with which she has been campaigning on dementia for so long. To have achieved another step forward in how we deal with dementia is to be commended. I will not try to mention everybody who has been involved, because I will miss somebody out and someone will take the huff, but everyone has done a tremendous job.</p><p>I am not an expert on dementia, and I do not know as much about it as many other people do. I have been fortunate in that my family and those who are close to me have not been sufferers&#8212;yet. We all know that it can happen to anyone at any time. I remember that many years ago, when Nicola Sturgeon and I were out campaigning in a by-election, we spoke to a couple and the lady was suffering from dementia. Nicola and I still talk about it, because even at that time the lady was younger than I was. She was between Nicola's age and mine. Although the vast majority of <place-holder colnum=\"20519\"/> sufferers are over 65, as the figures show, there are people who suffer from pre-senile dementia, which must be a huge burden for their families.</p><p>The projected figures for South Lanarkshire, where I live and which my constituency covers, bear thinking about. It is reckoned that, during a 10-year period, the number of sufferers in South Lanarkshire will increase by 25 per cent. However, the increase in East Kilbride is estimated at 51 per cent, which raises issues. Dr Simpson spoke a lot of sense about how we ask service providers to deal with the issues.</p><p>Talking of service providers, there is a group in my constituency that I have come to know well&#8212;the East Kilbride dementia group. The group supports dementia sufferers who are still living in the community and works to maintain their independence. I am hugely impressed by the work that it does, particularly as it was founded in 1991 and has been working all this time. It has accepted a massive challenge and it has succeeded because it pushed out the boundaries and did so with a great passion and belief. It believes in a homely environment with small groups of service users and that the ideal setting has a service user to staff ratio of no more than 3:1.</p><p>The group helps people to maintain their independence, supports and helps people to live at home and provides opportunities for social activity. I thought it was great when the group told me that, although the users might not remember that they had a day out or where they went, as the old clich&#233;s might suggest, they will have the sense of wellbeing that is so important because it maintains the sense of life and of being worth while. We should never forget that, because it is just as important as many of the other aspects.</p><p>The last thing I want to mention is a wonderful example of community spirit. A small company in East Kilbride called Ecebs recently did a team-building exercise with its staff and it decided to help a local charity. It went to the East Kilbride dementia group and 30 Ecebs staff&#8212;the entire staff complement&#8212;turned up for an away day at the group's premises. From the managing director Alan Moody right down, the entire team spent the whole day completely redecorating the group's premises and doing all the gardening and handyman and handywoman jobs that needed to be done. Is that not a wonderful example of community spirit? There were benefits for both sides. Ecebs benefited from its teamwork and the dementia group benefited from the work that was carried out for them. That is to be commended. I hope that other small and large companies that tune into some of what we talk about in Parliament will take up that idea, rather than pay consultants a fortune to run team-building exercises, which can be done in the local community.<place-holder colnum=\"20520\"/></p><p>Again, I congratulate Irene Oldfather and everyone else.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20207615", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dementia"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Irene Oldfather is going to become very embarrassed by the praise that is being heaped on her tonight.

Even when the corner is turned and we are told that we are no longer technically in recession, the unprecedented level of borrowing that is the result of the UK's management of the economy will have serious consequences for Scotland's public spending profile, well beyond the short term. As Professor Bell concludes:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the more profound effects on public services will arise due to the 'overhang' of debt that has to be repaid by the UK government and the negative effect that will have on public spending throughout the UK ... over at least the next decade.\"</p><p>Under the current constitutional settlement, if interest rates rise the effect on UK finances will again mean that the Scottish budget is hammered. The Scottish Government will be constrained by the Barnett squeeze, by increasing payments for inherited PFI projects and by the ridiculous situation whereby, unlike Scottish local authorities, the Northern Ireland Executive and even English <place-holder colnum=\"19540\"/> parish councils, the Scottish Government is unable to borrow.</p><p>There has been talk recently about how we must all pull together. Of course we should do so. An important step that the Parliament could take would be to campaign unanimously for borrowing powers for Scotland, which would give us the flexibility prudently to allow Scotland's Parliament to be more responsive to Scotland's needs. Many people support that approach, from Unison and the Scottish Trades Union Congress to the Royal Society of Edinburgh and our churches. We should work together for borrowing powers.</p><p>On the subject of political consensus, I will seek consensus with Mr Kerr. We must get beyond the game of ping-pong in which members argue, \"It's a cut\", \"No it's not\", \"Yes, it is.\" That is not constructive for anyone. Let us consider the facts. At the beginning of the three-year spending review, a settlement was agreed and publicly funded organisations were given an indication of their spending capacity for the period. Then, &#163;500 million was wheeched away by the chancellor in his 2008 pre-budget report. The budget is now &#163;500 million less than was previously advised. Public bodies will receive &#163;500 million less than was expected. Some MSPs have worked in public services and some of them have probably been budget holders in public service organisations. If they had been promised funding and then had it withdrawn, they would have been in no doubt whatever that there had been a cut. That has to be faced.</p><p>The Finance Committee urged subject committees carefully to reflect on its report. Hard times are ahead, and the Parliament and Government must face them together.

Nevertheless, I thank my colleague, Willie Coffey, for initiating the debate and for initiating&#8212;with Kilmarnock Football Club&#8212;the petition that is moving towards its aim of attracting 100,000 signatures. The wide spread of signatures that the petition has received from all around the globe emphasises the reach of the Johnnie Walker brand.</p><p>East Ayrshire Council, too, has been extremely effective in developing a response to Diageo's proposals. Councillor Dougie Reid and his team, with the support of opposition group leaders and their respective teams, have provided important leadership in the community's response to the threat to the local economy. The threat to the local economy is major&#8212;a fact that has been recognised and acted on by the Cabinet Secretary <place-holder colnum=\"19173\"/> for Finance and Sustainable Growth and by the Scottish Government.</p><p>In questions on the cabinet secretary's earlier statement on Diageo, I spoke of the importance of heritage and provenance to the premium brand that is Scotch whisky. The importance of the Johnnie Walker brand was a feature of the speeches that we heard from Willie Coffey and other members in the debate. The whole Scotch whisky industry is widely respected around the globe&#8212;its reputation has been hard fought for and built up over many years.</p><p>Recognising the presence of whisky in the international market, I was surprised to see the analysis that was carried out by Donald Blair, which highlighted the poor rate of growth in the production of whisky since the 1970s. Apart from a short upswing in the lead-up to the recession, growth has averaged no more than about 1 per cent per annum for the past 25-30 years. Diageo's decision to shed such a large number of jobs has turned attention to the industry in a way that has not happened for many years. Communities and workers up and down Scotland are asking, \"If jobs at Johnnie Walker&#8212;the world's leading whisky brand&#8212;are not safe, what jobs in the industry are safe?\" Willie Coffey's suggestion that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee conduct an inquiry into the future of the industry is helpful. That could help Parliament and the Government to identify barriers to growth of the industry, and give further consideration to the issues of heritage and provenance. That could help to set the industry on the path towards sustainable volume growth&#8212;not the growth in value that helped Diageo to pile up more than &#163;2 billion of profit while throwing hundreds of workers on to the streets. The committee could address how we might gain a proper understanding of the place of whisky in the UK domestic market. Despite significant growth in the consumption of spirits in the UK, sales of whisky have declined by some 40 per cent. I understand from Willie Coffey that Johnnie Walker Red Label is not even offered for sale in some supermarkets in the Kilmarnock area. Also, despite its international profile, Johnnie Walker does not feature in the UK's leading brands.</p><p>The committee could also consider alcohol duty. Some have said that the Johnnie Walker issue has no link to the debate on alcohol duty, but the future of the industry cannot be examined without consideration of all the issues.

To do other than apply the 10p tax would be to risk the sort of quagmire of negotiation with the UK Treasury from which this Parliament and Scotland have already suffered the consequences.

The Gurkhas are almost the stuff of legend. People hear about those strong and committed soldiers and the fiercely contested recruitment process that goes on in Nepal to win the right to be a Gurkha soldier. There was therefore general revulsion when people realised, as a result of a campaign, how the Gurkha widows were being treated. There was also outrage with the recognition that the Government at Westminster tried to put what I would call disingenuous conditions on the right of retired Gurkhas to live here. Jim Tolson talked about the very basic condition, which was that soldiers had to serve 20 years for automatic qualification, but rank-and-file Gurkhas serve only 15 years. That seemed a very strange condition.<place-holder colnum=\"18659\"/></p><p>The Gurkha campaign did not arrive from nowhere. A lot of people have worked for the campaign for many years, and it has been fuelled by individual cases of injustice. At the time, I was shocked by the story of Honorary Lieutenant Tul Bahadur Pun, who had to get special leave to enter the UK for medical treatment in 2007 and in fact had to rely on the charity of the Gurkha brigade for welfare support while he was here. This was a soldier who won the Victoria Cross for his bravery in Burma in 1944, when he took on and defeated Japanese machine-gun bunkers single-handedly after they had killed the rest of his section. After he was refused treatment at a national health service hospital, he was so disgusted that he turned in his medals at Downing Street. I understand that he was told that he was due the NHS thousands of pounds in payment for the treatment that he had already received. I pay tribute to Nick Clegg, who joined Mr Pun on that demonstration in June 2008.</p><p>By one of those strange coincidences that come round, it turned out that that soldier had saved the life of Joanna Lumley's father by carrying him back to a medical post under fire after he had been shot. As we all now know, it was after reading her father's diary that Ms Lumley became involved in the Gurkha campaign&#8212;and a very good profile she gave to it. We should all honour her for that, as well as honouring all the other people who have campaigned so hard over the years, such as Major Bill MacKay of Dunfermline, who was mentioned by Jim Tolson and who is mentioned in the motion.</p><p>As I said, those who fight for this country deserve equal respect, whether they come from Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, Commonwealth countries or Nepal. I believe that the armed forces have that feeling and give that recognition. My colleague the Minister for Schools and Skills, Keith Brown, served alongside the Gurkhas in the Falklands when he was a marine. As Jim Tolson said, Gurkhas have been part of the army for almost 200 years, and 200,000 Gurkhas fought in the two world wars, with 45,000 believed to have lost their lives fighting for Britain. I absolutely endorse the point that, if someone is willing to die for this country, they should be allowed to live in it.</p><p>When the then Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, made her announcements about the UK Government turnaround, she made some commitments, one of which was that the 1,400 outstanding applications for settlement that were currently with the UK Border Agency would be processed on the basis of the new policy as a matter of urgency before 11 June. That date has now passed, and I have been unable to find out whether the target was met.

Still Labour defended PFI. The contract for West Lothian College had to be bought out at a cost of &#163;20 million, because 35 per cent of the college's expenditure was on property costs and an average of only 9 per cent was on further education. The companies behind the deal to build Hairmyres hospital&#8212;that Labour flagship project&#8212;gained around &#163;145 million from an initial investment of just &#163;8.4 million.

Among the range of successful companies there is Controlled Therapeutics, which develops and produces pharmaceuticals. The workforce in East Kilbride developed a vaginal insert to aid childbirth in cases where the birth is medically induced.

It direct-sells memory upgrades for computers and other electronic devices. Filtronic Comtek designs, manufactures and markets components for cellular infrastructures. We are also fortunate to have the headquarters of the Worldmark group, which began in East Kilbride. Its logo is \"Global Solutions ... Locally\". Worldmark's operation in East Kilbride includes the company's research and development functions, as well as manufacturing. That is crucial.</p><p>We all recognise that business enterprise research and development expenditure is not as high as it should be in Scotland and that it does not reflect our capabilities. Studies have shown that, despite Scotland's universities having punched above their weight for research framework programme grants from the European Union, for example, that is not reflected in the private sector. Some of that can be put down to methods of accountability, with some company branches in Scotland having their R and D work registered at headquarters elsewhere, but it is vital to recognise and to promote further the interface between academia and business. The cabinet secretary recognises that, through objectives to increase public-private knowledge transfer, to address issues of intellectual copyright&#8212;she mentioned that today&#8212;to encourage private sector research collaboration, and to take forward the proposal from Universities Scotland for a single forum for all available intellectual property from Scottish institutions.</p><p>I note from the Royal Society of Edinburgh's paper, which was kindly supplied to us all prior to the debate, its view that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"since the joint RSE/Scottish Enterprise <em>Commercialisation Report</em>, there has been a dramatic improvement in the efficiency and drive of the Scottish universities in connecting with business.\"</p><p>That is welcome. I also note from the RSE paper the reiteration of the European Union's move towards a European research area. With its skills <place-holder colnum=\"16043\"/> and expertise, Scotland should take full advantage of that, working and collaborating with partners, with our UK neighbours and with others. Scientific research and development is a discipline that is ripe for collaboration, whether among national and international academic institutions, through regional initiatives, through private enterprise or indeed&#8212;I say this to Rhona Brankin, in her absence&#8212;through independent nations sharing expertise with mutual trust and respect.</p><p>Scotland has a good and justified reputation internationally for the quality of its science base. We should celebrate that, but we should do so without complacency. There has been much discussion about enthusing laypeople and, particularly, pupils and scholars. The Government is taking that on board, as are others. In that regard, too, science has a home in East Kilbride. One of our residents, retired physicist Dr Ravi Singhal, gives free public lectures in the James Watt auditorium, which are filled by people who are eager to learn about physics. He has just completed his sixth series of lectures as part of the community education initiative under the science for all programme. I hope that Mr Singhal repeats the endeavour, because I would very much like to go along and learn.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has mentioned in the past the importance that she places on science development. I will continue to support her and the Government in driving Scotland forward and keeping us ahead of the game. Fiona Hyslop has long stressed, in opposition as well as in government, that science and technology are allied but distinct topics.

Just as no one in Scotland should be targeted or victimised because of their race or religion, no one in Scotland should be targeted because of their sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability. The proposals will mean that the divisive and scarring crimes that we are talking about are taken more seriously by the justice system and by society more generally. <place-holder colnum=\"15887\"/></p><p>That is a very positive message to send out, and it should lead to more effective deterrence. It will also bring us into line with the rest of the UK, which dealt with the matter in 2003.</p><p>As has been said already, the bill does not propose any new offence; instead a new statutory aggravation will be applied to any crime of motivation by \"malice and ill-will\" on the ground of the victim's actual or presumed disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity, in parallel with existing statutory aggravations of motivation by \"malice and ill-will\" on the ground of the victim's actual or presumed race or religion. The perpetrator will be guilty of an aggravated offence and the court will have to take that into account when deciding a sentence.</p><p>It is important to remember that the aggravation is based on the motivation of the accused, not the identity of the victim. That will send out a strong message and introduce greater consistency. Like others, I hope that it will encourage more victims of such crime to report offences because of the clear message that society recognises the abhorrence of the motivation behind them. It will ensure the recording of the levels of such crimes, which is crucial for any nation that believes in parity of esteem and respect for all whose actions do not harm others.</p><p>Figures provided by Inclusion Scotland show that people with disability are four times more likely to be violently assaulted than people without disability and almost twice as likely to be burgled. The organisation states that visually impaired people are four times more likely to be verbally and physically abused than sighted people. People with mental health issues are 11 times more likely to be victimised and 90 per cent of adults with a learning difficulty report being bullied.</p><p>Some people are sceptical of such figures but, whether or not there is doubt about them, one instance of abuse is too many and once is enough for a message to be sent out. The motive of such crimes can be to take advantage of a victim's vulnerability or their being a bit different. If it is about easy targeting and perceiving people as weak, it is about preying on the vulnerable, which is just not acceptable.</p><p>Some people think that introducing legislation is unnecessary and that society should consider other ways of dealing with the problem, such as taking action at the other end. The two options are not mutually exclusive, and work goes on at both ends across society. I commend cultural and arts organisations for the action that they take, such as Lung Ha's Theatre Company in Edinburgh, which has long worked with adults with learning difficulties. Many of members have attended their plays, which have portrayed the difficulties of living with learning difficulties and shown how people <place-holder colnum=\"15888\"/> are bullied, both institutionally and by society in general. More great work is done by Theatre Nemo in East Kilbride, which deals with mental health issues in the health service and justice system. The work that we do is two-pronged, and we have to look at the issues from both sides.</p><p>The National AIDS Trust wrote to us all. It has a particular interest in section 1(8) of the bill about the definition of disability, which includes any</p><p class=\"indent\">\"condition which has (or may have) a substantial or long-term effect\",</p><p>such as HIV/AIDS. Stigma and discrimination are a distressing and dangerous reality for many people who live with HIV. One in three people with HIV has experienced discrimination linked to their HIV positive status. Again, it is very important that we take measures to show everyone that that is not acceptable.</p><p>The bill has a journey to make through stages 2 and 3, and changes might come its way, but in general I am content that it moves us in the right direction. The ultimate aim of us all is to get to the point where people are accepted with no prejudice and no law is needed to enforce that principle.

I was pleased that Pauline McNeill said that we need to revisit the issue from time to time, as that acknowledges its importance and reflects what many other speakers said. She also said that the Government needs to be ambitious about the use of the 2005 act; we must all be that.</p><p>The Government's draft plan is out for consultation and other public agencies&#8212;such as the councils, with more to follow&#8212;have Gaelic plans up and running. However, as many have said today, we must not say, \"Right, we've done that\" and put the plans on a shelf. We must use the plans as living documents for a living language and culture and expand them all the time.</p><p>Peter Peacock was hugely influential in the shaping of the 2005 act, as he was the relevant minister at the time. While I was sitting being lectured earlier, I was thinking of calling him Captain Peacock. However, I appreciate his input into the process. It is important that everyone moves forward in a spirit of consensus.</p><p>That said, Ted Brocklebank always has to get in a wee dig about Scots and English. I have no problem describing English as a dialect of Scots&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"14607\"/> no problem at all. There is, however, a serious point in what Mr Brocklebank said. He was quite right when he stated that no native Gaelic speaker does not understand English. That is where we are today&#8212;but there are plenty of native Gaels who do not understand Gaelic. That reflects the history, as Rob Gibson pointed out, of the legislation against Gaelic language and culture and of the people who were affected by it. That is one of the reasons&#8212;as Pauline McNeill and other members have pointed out&#8212;for being proactive and ambitious today.</p><p>Johann Lamont's contribution summed up that history, because she comes from a family that is a product of the putting down of the Gaels and the language, and of how people learned to deal with that. The onus is on us all to move forward, and there are many ways to do so. Practically every speaker mentioned education, which shows just how important it is.</p><p>It cannot be denied that there are challenges. Secondary education, which was mentioned, is a challenge for many reasons, but the Government is working closely on it and we want to do what we can to move forward. The Minister for Schools and Skills, who is sitting beside me, and I recently met jointly Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education and B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig to discuss those issues.</p><p>I liked the contributions about education from John Farquhar Munro and Dave Stewart, and the suggestions about the importance of the spoken word. That is not to do down grammar, language construction or anything else involved in learning, but the Gaelic language comes from an oral tradition. The absolute beauty of its sound means that Gaelic is something to sit and listen to and enjoy&#8212;and laugh and cry about, even if you do not understand it. The spoken word is very important&#8212;learning to speak and to sing are as important as other aspects of education.</p><p>It is important to reach young people, too, and there are lots of ways to do that. Some initiatives have been mentioned, such as the Gaelic online dictionary. It is great that we have something like that now, and the people who have been instrumental in that project should be congratulated. Bashir Ahmad recently told me that there is a move to translate the Qur'an into Gaelic, which is wonderful.</p><p>The mygaelic social networking site that Pauline McNeill spoke about is hugely important in trying to reach young people. I was at a conference on Lewis recently about community initiatives for Gaelic. It was great to hear the young people telling my age group&#8212;and some who were older than me&#8212;that we have to listen to them about how they want their language to be used. Mygaelic&#8212;the Gaelic Facebook, if you like&#8212;is a way forward for young people to be able to be able <place-holder colnum=\"14608\"/> to use their own language, or their language of choice, to communicate in all sorts of ways.</p><p>The subject of BBC Alba&#8212;and its vibrancy&#8212;has been raised many times. It is not just about having a Gaelic channel, but about everything that is behind that. The production companies such as mac tv, Media nan Eilean and Studio Alba are hugely important. That shows that there is an economy in Gaelic culture and language that can lead, as Rob Gibson said, to the potential for Gaelic to underpin growth in the Highlands and Islands, which is very important.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14649276", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic Language Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted by the great degree of consensus that we have had today and by the quality of the debate.

I was delighted when the First Minister opened the F&#224;s creative centre in the college. Again, that is about encouraging work on the economy in the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>It has been interesting to discuss the various cultural aspects of Gaelic. Rob Gibson referred to a jagged edge, and how it can be perceived that Gaelic stops here and Scots starts there. However, part of the beauty of our nation is the fluidity of the way in which all the different cultures fuse and mesh. I was interested in Willie Coffey's contribution about Robert Burns and his familiarity with Gaelic. The other night, I spoke to Margaret Bennett, who has done much good work for the school of Scottish studies. She also told me about Robert Burns's interaction with Gaelic.</p><p>We heard about the crossover with Hugh MacDiarmid, who translated Duncan Ban McIntyre's poetry with help from Sorley MacLean. That represented a collaboration of poets of different styles. Just last year, I was delighted to be at the premier of Ronald Stevenson's \"In Praise of Ben Doran\", which was about Hugh MacDiarmid's translations of the poetry of Duncan Ban McIntyre.</p><p>Education is important. Ken Macintosh and many others talked about the benefits of Gaelic schools for education generally, as well as for the bilingualism and, often, trilingualism that is the result of children learning Gaelic at an early age. That has been proven over and over again. I am pleased that Ken Macintosh welcomed the First <place-holder colnum=\"14609\"/> Minister's announcement at the Mod about the capital budget for Gaelic schools. The Minister for Schools and Skills has asked me to point out that there are other resources too. We all want education to move on quickly, but we should not get despondent about it. There is glow&#8212;the schools intranet&#8212;and there is the scholar programme run by Heriot-Watt University, which provides access to Gaelic learning and raises Gaelic's profile in non-Gaelic speaking areas.</p><p>Peter Peacock talked about road signage. He is right to say that in our draft Gaelic plan we have discussed Transport Scotland's research on how road signs can affect accidents. Transport Scotland says that once the research is completed it will consider whether to increase bilingual signage on trunk roads and so on. I ask members, many of whom feel strongly about that, to put in submissions about the draft Gaelic plan and let us see that strength of feeling. On the subject of signs, I am delighted to confirm to Peter Peacock that the Scottish Government did indeed ensure that the signage at Government buildings was bilingual. I am delighted to hear that he wants the Gaelic to be much more prominent.</p><p><em>The member continued in Gaelic.</em></p><p>A-rithist, tapadh leibh airson ur taic.

This is a very important day for the Scottish Government and for Gaelic matters. We have been working hard to support Gaelic in many ways: in education, in the arts, in broadcasting and more throughout the year. Today, we are taking another step with the Scottish Government's Gaelic plan.</p><p><em>The member continued in English.</em></p><p>I am pleased to announce today that the Scottish Government has published its consultation paper for our draft Gaelic language plan. I am very pleased with it, and I hope that everyone else in the chamber is, too&#8212;apart from with the inevitable drafting error, which has now been corrected. I apologise for that.</p><p>Gaelic belongs to Scotland and is a unique and essential part of the rich cultural life of Scotland, so we must ensure that we take the necessary steps to secure its place in the future. The Scottish Government has made its position very clear: we came to Government with a strong programme of ambitious Gaelic commitments, on which we are making good and steady progress. My hope is that those commitments and initiatives, and the increased funding that we are putting in place, will improve the status and appeal of the language. I hope that they will also lead to an increase in use of Gaelic in the home, at school, in the community, <place-holder colnum=\"14567\"/> at the workplace, in the arts and in public life generally.</p><p>Along with five others, the Scottish Government was one of the initial public bodies to receive a notice to produce a Gaelic language plan by B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig. The Scottish Government's Gaelic language plan sets out the measures to be taken in relation to use of Gaelic within Government. It will set out how the Scottish Government will use, and enable use of, Gaelic in delivery of its services.</p><p>The Scottish Government's Gaelic language plan will include commitments in relation to our corporate identity, our communications, our publications and our staffing. It will outline measures that we have put in place to support the promotion of Gaelic throughout Scotland, which are aimed at raising the status of Gaelic, promoting the use of Gaelic and encouraging learning of Gaelic.</p><p>With our Gaelic plan, the Scottish Government will seek to raise awareness about, and to improve the status of Gaelic. I am pleased to announce that we hope to recruit a new Gaelic language plan development officer, who will have responsibility for implementing the plan and monitoring progress.</p><p>I have been impressed with agencies such as Historic Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and the National Library of Scotland, which have begun work on their Gaelic language plans without having received formal notification. I encourage other bodies to do the same. Of course, other Scottish public authorities&#8212;Highland Council, Argyll and Bute Council, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Parliament&#8212;have prepared Gaelic language plans and are moving forward with their implementation. Other bodies, including Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, Learning and Teaching Scotland, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council, Glasgow City Council and City of Edinburgh Council, are following suit. I congratulate all those bodies for their efforts. I am confident that Gaelic plans have improved the status and have increased awareness and use of Gaelic throughout Scotland. There will be further progress as more plans are prepared and finalised.</p><p>There continues to be a need for expansion in Gaelic-medium education, which is vital to support growth in the number of Gaelic speakers. There has been good progress on Gaelic-medium education and important commitments have been made in Gaelic plans. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar's Gaelic plan contains a commitment to provide Gaelic-medium education as mainstream primary provision. Highland Council's Gaelic plan contains <place-holder colnum=\"14568\"/> a commitment to open a further two dedicated Gaelic schools&#8212;it has decided to move forward on the issue in Portree and Fort William. Discussions are also on-going about the possibility of a dedicated Gaelic school in Edinburgh. I take this opportunity to support the proposal and to remind councils of the Scottish Government's support for the establishment of dedicated Gaelic schools. The developments that I have described are good and welcome, and we need to maintain momentum.</p><p>The Scottish Government has very much demonstrated its clear support for Gaelic education. We have increased our support for Gaelic-medium education throughout Scotland, and the Government's funding for resources to support teachers and pupils in Gaelic education is at an unprecedented level. A major review of Gaelic early years education was commissioned earlier this month. There can be no question about our commitment to Gaelic education in Scotland. The amendment in Pauline McNeill's name acknowledges the need for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"continued investment in and expansion of Gaelic-medium education.\"</p><p>That expansion is continuing and should continue in the future.</p><p>The presence of Gaelic in our lives enriches us all, so it is essential that there be a living language community to support Gaelic. We must therefore give thought to how we will strengthen and grow that community. The language is in a fragile condition and I believe that we are at a critical point for Gaelic in Scotland. I am encouraged by the desire to support Gaelic that I find in Scottish public life, not least in the Parliament, where the issue enjoys cross-party support. I am encouraged, too, by the commitment and vitality of Gaelic speakers, learners and supporters.</p><p>Efforts to keep the language fresh and current can be illustrated by recent developments, including the online Gaelic natural history database, \"Faclan N&#224;dair\", which was launched today by Scottish Natural Heritage. Such developments are encouraging. We welcome the success of MG Alba and we are all working together to ensure that the BBC Alba channel can be seen on Freeview, to the benefit of everyone in the country. There are encouraging signs in the Gaelic education sector, in the ambitious work of Sabhal M&#242;r Ostaig and in the development by B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig of public authority Gaelic plans. Our duty is to maintain that progress, to use the initiatives that have been put in place and to work to ensure a secure future for Gaelic so that the language has its rightful place in Scotland.</p><p>I am aware that I have more time for speaking, but I will not use it because it is important that <place-holder colnum=\"14569\"/> other members can contribute fully to the debate. I hope to be able to respond to what they say. I look forward very much to receiving responses from members and others&#8212;individuals, organisations and public and private bodies right across the country&#8212;about the contents of our plan. We are here to listen to what people say.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that Gaelic is an integral part of Scotland's heritage, national identity and current cultural life; welcomes and supports the launch of the consultation on the Scottish Government's draft Gaelic Language Plan, and acknowledges the work being carried out on the implementation of other Gaelic language plans by Argyll and Bute Council, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Edinburgh City Council, Glasgow City Council, Highland Council, the Scottish Parliament and Highland and Islands Enterprise.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14649276", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic Language Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Feasgar math.

I am always happy to meet Bill Kidd and am happy to include Bill Butler and Bill Aitken in such a meeting. It struck me that they could be called the three Bills.</p><p>I do not want to go into detail at the moment, but we should note that the Scottish Arts Council supports and promotes youth theatre. I understand that Knightswood Youth Theatre is in discussion with the SAC.<place-holder colnum=\"14469\"/></p><p>Bill Butler asked about discussions with other local authorities on issues that are related to the topic of debate. I recently attended an interesting conference with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and some local authorities. I am sure that other ministers with direct responsibility for the issues to which members have referred have also attended such conferences. However, that is a discussion for another time.</p><p>I do not tonight want to take any time away from congratulating Knightswood Youth Theatre on winning, and celebrating its winning, the Philip Lawrence award. That is an exceptional achievement that celebrates both the standard of citizenship that those involved have shown, and the outstanding contributions that the theatre group has made to its community. It really is inspiring. When we think of the remarkable work that has been done in the theatre group's short existence, it is even more inspiring.</p><p>I have a particular delight in taking part in the debate, having heard from our four colleagues who all represent the Knightswood area, because I was born in Lincoln Avenue in Knightswood and lived most of my teenage years just round the corner in Baldric Road. I therefore know the area where all the youngsters in the theatre group come from.</p><p>I know the problems that the group has faced over the past few years and I know how people have worked to make Knightswood a community that stands up to be counted. Those efforts have been made by the young people involved and those who have taken the time to organise, teach and support the group. It is a great example of community spirit. Sandra White mentioned the influence of the group from the Lincoln Avenue flats on things that are so important to us. Again, that is to be celebrated.</p><p>Aileen Ritchie needs a special mention, although, as Bill Kidd said, it is always hard to mention individuals. However, she deserves to be mentioned again for her continued support for the arts in Glasgow.</p><p>We should never forget that the award that the youth theatre has won was set up in memory of Philip Lawrence. What happened to him was tragic, and it highlighted problems that are faced by the nations in the United Kingdom. What has happened in his name shows the great courage that citizens can have when they care about their communities. Philip Lawrence was an inspirational figure whose legacy continues in the annual awards. His deep-seated conviction was that all young people are capable of achieving great things, as the members of Knightswood Youth Theatre have shown.<place-holder colnum=\"14470\"/></p><p>Knightswood Youth Theatre is also a great example of how the arts can tackle a huge range of realities in young people's lives by using theatre for expression. As Bill Aitken said, serious issues such as racism, bullying, friendship, alcoholism, romance, divorce and teenage suicide have all been addressed in a way that allows the young people involved to be heard.</p><p>In bringing together local residents, Knightswood Youth Theatre gives Glasgow's asylum seekers, refugees and young people a chance to tell each other their stories, to share experiences and to celebrate the differences that make each of them interesting. Collectively, such differences give something very special to an area. The youth theatre's approach is great because it leads to improved understanding of different belief systems and encourages young people to overcome difficulties. Such activities are part of real community development, whereby folk take the initiative and grow something that really matters to them.</p><p>The Scottish Government is committed to supporting community development. The recently published \"Culture: Culture Delivers\" encourages use of culture as an important way of advancing local and national wellbeing and, indeed, prosperity. The cashback for communities initiatives also continue to run throughout the country. Those projects&#8212;which are funded by money that has been confiscated from convicted criminals&#8212;include a range of partnerships with Scottish sporting, arts and business associations that encourage young people to see that they can choose different paths and have different aspirations. As Bill Kidd said, Knightswood Youth Theatre has also received support from LINKES, which is a project that is run by and for people in the area. LINKES has received funding from the Government's fairer Scotland fund.</p><p>I reiterate that the success that Knightswood Youth Theatre has attained in its short history is nothing short of outstanding. From a series of pilot workshops in early 2007, the youth theatre went on to sell-out nights at Glasgow's Tron theatre in 2008. Audiences have talked about its performances&#8212;I have not yet had the privilege of attending one, but I shall&#8212;which have, I understand, reduced some to tears of sadness and of joy. That is great talent that these young folk have exhibited. For the third year running, the National Theatre of Scotland has invited Knightswood Youth Theatre to perform at the exchange festival, which again demonstrates the quality and impact of the group's work.</p><p>Another wonderful outcome of Knightswood Youth Theatre's work so far is that, as well as providing enjoyment and sharing stories with the community and with the whole of Scotland, the <place-holder colnum=\"14471\"/> group has uncovered several talented performers. The youth theatre's approach has allowed its members to have the confidence to perform, to act, to write and even to direct. It has been able to nurture the talent and gifts that each individual has within them. In particular, I congratulate Marlene Madenge on being offered a role alongside a professional cast in the National Theatre of Scotland's production of \"365\" at the Edinburgh festival last year. I saw that performance, which was a very moving piece of theatre. I am sure that the performance was a great experience for Marlene and for those whom she took along with her to enjoy both the play and the recognition that was given to Knightswood Youth Theatre.<place-holder colnum=\"14472\"/></p><p>I thank Bill Kidd for lodging the motion, which has provided us with the opportunity to congratulate Knightswood Youth Theatre not only on its success in the Philip Lawrence awards but on its continuing work, which has helped a community to come together. The use of drama is very powerful in confronting the difficult challenges that face many individuals and communities. I wish the group continued and increasing success in its future productions.

Throughout the debate, we have heard the depth of feeling that the developing humanitarian crisis in Gaza has generated here and elsewhere. In Scotland, the UK and beyond, people have been demonstrating because they are sickened by what they are seeing and because they recognise that a death by violence is an unjust death.</p><p>We have heard about the history and complexity of the politics of the region, which are long standing. We heard about the failure of UN resolutions and the failure to secure a viable two-state solution for Palestine and Israel.</p><p>All citizens of the world have the right to go about their business without fear of attack and, as we have heard today, a people must attend to its security. However, the Israeli Government must also know that world opinion and its long-term self-interest cannot be reconciled with the effects that the recent bombing and ground offensive have had on the people of Gaza.</p><p>More than 600 Palestinians have died since the military offensive began and more than 13,000 people have been displaced. As Sandra White and others have said, people have been displaced within a tight settlement, which has been blockaded for such a long time. These people have nowhere to run to. Food is in short supply and more than 70 per cent of people are without a water supply. Medical facilities are under extreme pressure. As the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said, having a three-hour cease-fire each day on both sides and having a humanitarian corridor open, is completely insufficient to feed 750,000 people a day. A permanent cease-fire is needed.</p><p>Whatever one believes about the politics of the region, the humanitarian plight of the people of Gaza is straightforward. At least we have achieved consensus on that today. I am glad that we can all add our support to those Scots and Scottish organisations that are contributing to the international efforts to confront the food, water, energy and medical emergencies that the conflict in Gaza has brought about.</p><p>A number of NGOs and aid agencies that are based in Scotland are currently working in Gaza. For example, Christian Aid Scotland is supporting the partner organisation the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, which is working in Gaza's hospitals. Also, Mercy Corps Scotland expects to deliver more than $250,000 of food, non-food <place-holder colnum=\"13806\"/> items and medical supplies to the war-affected families. However, its truck-load of food commodities remains in the queue of vehicles at the closed border for entry into Gaza. The border is also closed to humanitarian personnel. Mercy Corps is continuing to lobby and make applications for entry into the Gaza strip to enable it to disperse those supplies.</p><p>The British Red Cross has donated &#163;75,000 to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. We have heard much in the debate about the work of Islamic Relief. Its assistance includes emergency food supplies, food aid to hospitals and the purchase of medical equipment in the west bank for delivery to Gaza. In addition, Save the Children is providing food and medical supplies and Oxfam UK, which works with partners in Gaza, is trying to gain access.</p><p>As Nicola Sturgeon said, Scottish Government officials are in regular contact with NGOs who are working on the ground in Gaza. We stand ready to respond favourably to any request for humanitarian assistance. In that regard, the main problem at the moment, according to Department for International Development, is not the lack of assistance that is being offered but the ability to get that assistance to the people of Gaza. As Des McNulty said, we all have a responsibility to try to help any people who are suffering as much as the people of Gaza are suffering; they need that human response from the rest of us.</p><p>I return to the cease-fire. Only a complete cessation of violence will suffice; three-hourly pauses in bombing are absolutely insufficient to help the Gazan people. Only when arms are laid to rest and dialogue begins will the people of Gaza be able to rebuild their lives.</p><p>We are in contact with DFID, as we are with the Scottish NGOs and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It is essential that, when we are enabled to be of assistance, the response should be a co-ordinated one. DFID has pledged &#163;4 million of humanitarian assistance. Again, it has stated with our full backing that full and safe access for supplies and aid workers is essential. On behalf of the Parliament, I express our respect for Scottish aid workers who go to places of danger. We respect their absolute care for the plight of others wherever they live in the world.</p><p>The long-term peace and security of the peoples of Israel and Palestine depend on meaningful dialogue and a two-state solution. At times, one can feel that people have been talking for long enough and that we are hitting our heads off a brick wall, but finding a meaningful solution to any violent conflict around the world is never easy. Any solution depends on dialogue and on people of closed minds opening up their minds. We have seen examples of that many times round the <place-holder colnum=\"13807\"/> world. I am sure that each member can think of an example.</p><p>Closed minds have to be opened; there has to be a new beginning. Courage and bravery on both sides are needed if people are to start afresh and sit down together. All Governments must care seriously about the people whom they represent. Governments around the world, particularly those with influence, should be striving to represent their people and working to achieve a solution.</p><p>I ask members to support the motion at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14551415", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaza (Humanitarian Disaster)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is absolutely right that the Parliament discusses these issues.

A civilisation is being systematically destroyed over the years. She also mentioned the people from important ranks in life who recognise the humanitarian aspects of the Palestinian cause, as well as the political aspects in many cases. Sadly, it is ordinary people who are paying the price all the time. Pauline McNeill, Sandra White and Hugh O'Donnell saw that at first hand when, on the third trip of Dignity, they witnessed the blockade and the effects of the siege of Gaza. Politicians are sometimes accused of being populist and leaping on causes. I want to put on record the fact that those three MSPs are long-standing activists on issues relating to the middle east. Pauline McNeill has visited Palestine before; Sandra White has visited Lebanon; the first time any of us met Hugh O'Donnell, his interest and passion in the subject was marked.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank asked why we should have a cross-party group on Palestine. I think that the answer is very plain and straightforward: Palestine is suffering and people are dying each day, or starving&#8212;as Jackie Baillie and others have outlined. If people can do nothing else, it is valuable to raise awareness and focus on the issue. I used to be a member of the group, which includes representation from a broad cross-section <place-holder colnum=\"13603\"/> of society. It is not a talking shop about one particular aspect of the situation; it is a genuine way of bringing people together to try to find a solution to the terrible things that are happening in Palestine. As Sandra White said, collective punishment is going on in Palestine, and we have a collective responsibility to make people aware of that and to do what we can to stop it.</p><p>As Sandra White, Bashir Ahmad and Jackie Baillie said, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has its 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year. Sadly, there are many examples across the world of human rights not being respected.</p><p>Hugh O'Donnell reminded us of the need to keep talking, and noted that if people had stopped talking about South Africa or Northern Ireland we might not have arrived at solutions there. Therefore, even if, as Robin Harper says, it is frustrating that the round-table discussions keep breaking down, it is time for action and incredibly important that we keep talking. The new discussions will focus on the UN Security Council's latest resolution, which encourages the USA, the European Union, the UN and Russia to keep working to help parties achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the middle east and to support the negotiations that were launched in November 2007.</p><p>The Scottish Government supports the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and recognises the need for a two-state solution. There is general agreement in this chamber that that is the way to secure a safe and secure future for Israel and Palestine.

It is hard to correlate that with Mark Thompson's commitment to production expansion in Scotland, which he said would have a floor, not a ceiling, of 9 per cent. Understandably, many in the Parliament and beyond will be concerned about jobs and programming.</p><p>I generally support the motion, but I cannot support its reference to supporting Ofcom's enhanced evolution model. Our response to the consultation, which is now on Ofcom's website, states that the Scottish Government has no preference for any of Ofcom's long-term models, provided that they are adapted to take full account of the recommendations of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission report.</p><p>We recognise that a commercial broadcaster can make a vital and vibrant contribution to broadcasting in Scotland. STV has a strong history, has a familiar and valued brand, and is a strong contributor to competition. As a provider of national and local news, STV is one of the strongest channel 3 licensees, with 42 per cent of people relying on it as their main source of news about Scotland. STV plays an important part in the Scottish broadcasting industry and makes a valued contribution to the economy.</p><p>We also recognise that STV is part of a complex licensing agreement with ITV that can pose difficulties, bring benefits and raise concerns. Most recently, those concerns have been about how STV can maintain its public service broadcasting commitments if ITV walks away from its public service broadcasting licence. I know that STV remains committed to being part of the public <place-holder colnum=\"13038\"/> service broadcasting landscape in Scotland. STV can continue to play a part in offering variety and competition in Scotland. We said as much in our response to Ofcom. However, as Ofcom's review suggests, we should also look at alternatives. We should not be restricted to focusing on plurality of news.</p><p>The Ofcom PSB review recognises that the requirements of the nations of the UK extend to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"sufficient content ... to address their distinct political and cultural needs\".</p><p>Research that was carried out by the Scottish Broadcasting Commission found that audiences in Scotland are less satisfied with current levels of provision in other key genres of programmes about Scotland. The proposed Scottish network would satisfy that demand for more Scottish programmes. In research that was carried out for the Scottish Broadcasting Commission, 82 per cent of those who were asked stated that they would be interested in watching a new Scottish television channel. The Scottish network would increase the opportunities for Scotland to see itself in a variety of quality programmes that would be available to all.</p><p>For an example of the desire for quality programming, we need look no further than BBC Alba. Its success since its launch in September shows that there is an appetite for quality Scottish content. The new channel secured viewing figures of 600,000 in its first week. Like members from all parties in the Parliament, I urge the BBC trust to give the new channel Freeview carriage so that it can reach all of Scotland and achieve its potential.</p><p>Ultimately, Ofcom has put forward a number of proposals for consultation. In the 8 October debate on the Scottish Broadcasting Commission report, I urged all members to respond to Ofcom's consultation.

Members would be pleasantly surprised&#8212;although I would prefer them to know what is happening than to be surprised&#8212;if they logged on to the websites to see what is happening from St Andrew's day through to the winter white festival, which VisitScotland is running; the winter festivals; hogmanay and new year, which is a great festival for Scotland; and right through to Celtic Connections in Glasgow.</p><p>Throughout the country, events are happening&#8212;Inverness has also been mentioned. That will run through to Scotland week as part of the homecoming year. I have heard many times about Ted Brocklebank's aversion to bekilted politicians. The First Minister did not wear a kilt in this year's tartan day parade, but Iain Smith looked charming in his kilt and I thought that the Red Hot Chilli Pipers had good knees.</p><p>We are linking initiatives all the way through, because that is important.

At the outset, he made a good link between this morning's statement on science and this afternoon's debate on the St Andrew's day celebrations. Our engineering tradition is one of Scotland's wonderful traditions. That ties in closely with the homecoming theme of good Scottish minds and innovations and&#8212;indeed&#8212;Burns.</p><p>I disagree with the comments that James Kelly made on the arc of prosperity. We cannot continue to ignore the fact that a number of those countries continue to perform strongly and have a higher standard of living than Scotland has.

This is a time for consensus in celebration of our national day.</p><p>Celebrations are taking place not just in Scotland, but throughout the world. Not just expatriate Scots, but people who have an affinity with Scotland are celebrating our national day. Our Scottish affairs offices in Beijing, Brussels and Washington are involved in a range of events. More than 90 diaspora groups around the world, from Ankara to Australia and from &#332;saka to Luxembourg, are organising celebrations.</p><p>On our national day, we celebrate our rich cultural heritage and our national identity&#8212;everything about Scotland. It is a time to reflect not only on what it means to be Scottish, but on how we see the future of Scotland. Our national conversation on Scotland's constitutional future allows everyone to debate the kind of Scotland that we want and how we best achieve that. St Andrew's day is the perfect time to celebrate and reflect.</p><p>This year's St Andrew's day is particularly special, because it provides the warm-up to the year of homecoming next year. Picking up the thread from St Andrew's day and the winter festivals, homecoming will be the biggest-ever <place-holder colnum=\"12893\"/> celebration of Scotland's achievements, culture and ties around the world. More than 300 events throughout Scotland are already planned to celebrate some of Scotland's great contributions to the world: Burns&#8212;2009 is the 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his birth, after all&#8212;as well as whisky, golf, great Scottish minds and innovations, and that rich culture and heritage.</p><p>The year of homecoming promises to be an extraordinary celebration of Scottish art, culture and heritage. Our national collections and performing companies and Edinburgh's festivals will play a prominent role in showcasing the wonderful creativity and energy that make up modern Scotland.

While we celebrate, St Andrew's day has a serious side. Given the global economic downturn, we need to promote Scotland this year more than ever as a great place to live, learn, work, do business and invest in and to visit. We need to position Scotland to take early advantage of any recovery and continue our drive to increase sustainable economic growth. That is why, as part of the Government's economic recovery programme, we are intensifying our activity and support for homecoming 2009 and promoting it through the St Andrew's day and winter festivals programmes.</p><p>Tourism is already a key sector in which Scotland has a comparative advantage but, in the light of recent changes in the exchange rate, we are focusing our efforts even more on boosting tourism and raising our international profile. We and our public sector partners are investing in all the important events in the Scottish calendar to promote Scotland domestically and internationally as a quality must-see, must-return destination.

We have set a clear target of 100,000 additional international visitors, which we expect not only to meet, but to exceed.</p><p>As part of the Government's economic recovery programme, we will promote the food and drink sector. St Andrew's day serves as both a timely reminder that Scotland is one of the finest food producers in the world and an opportunity to showcase Scotland as such. It provides the perfect occasion to celebrate the wealth of high-quality and internationally trusted produce from our farms, seas and food manufacturers.</p><p>While we encourage everyone to celebrate St Andrew's day, it is also good to remember why we celebrate it. St Andrew's day is part of our history and heritage. Around 832 AD at Athelstaneford in East Lothian, the broad white cross of St Andrew was seen against a bright blue sky. The National Flag Heritage Centre at Haddington celebrates year round the event that led to the saltire being adopted as our national flag. Each year, such celebrations culminate in the national celebration on 30 November, which this year falls on Sunday.

Gaelic is unique to Scotland, and everyone here has recognised that, I am delighted to say. Everyone has also recognised that we must take necessary and urgent steps to secure Gaelic for the future. For that reason, I thank Alasdair Allan for lodging the motion for debate, and everyone else who has contributed. I am delighted that we had to extend the time for the debate; it is a mark of the respect of everyone in Parliament.</p><p>The Scottish Government has made its position clear. We came to Government with a strong programme of ambitious Gaelic commitments, on which we are making good and steady progress. I hope that those commitments and initiatives, and the increased funding that we are putting in place, will improve the status and appeal of the language. I hope that it will also lead to an increase in the use of Gaelic in the home, school, community, workplace, the arts and in public life generally.</p><p>I commend the Scottish public authorities that have prepared Gaelic language plans&#8212;Highland Council, Argyll and Bute Council, and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar&#8212;and are moving forward with their implementation. On this day, I also congratulate the Scottish Parliament on the launch of its Gaelic language plan. The Parliament has <place-holder colnum=\"12716\"/> taken vigorous steps to promote the language, including the language planning forum that is being held here tomorrow.</p><p>I am confident that the Gaelic language plans have already led to an increase in the use of Gaelic. More progress must be made as plans are prepared and finalised. However, I take on board what Peter Peacock said: the plans cannot be left on a shelf&#8212;they must be constantly monitored, refreshed and renewed where necessary.</p><p>The Scottish Government was one of the initial bodies to receive a notice to produce a Gaelic language plan from B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig. Our plan will set out the measures that are to be taken on the use of Gaelic in Government, and how the Scottish Government will use and enable the use of Gaelic in the delivery of its services. It will include commitments on our corporate identity, communications, publications and staffing, and it will outline measures that we have taken to support the promotion of Gaelic throughout Scotland. It will describe measures that are aimed at raising the status of Gaelic, promoting its use and encouraging its learning.</p><p>When put together with the plans that are being rolled out by all the other public bodies, that could increase the status of Gaelic and the level of its use in Scotland. For that reason, I am pleased to be able to inform members that the Cabinet has considered and approved the Government's draft Gaelic plan, which will be prepared for a period of consultation in January 2009.</p><p>The text of tonight's motion refers to the need for an expansion in Gaelic-medium education. I agree; it is vital to support the growth in the number of Gaelic speakers. The Highland Council Gaelic language plan contains a commitment to open two more dedicated Gaelic schools and, last week, the Highland Council moved forward on that in Portree and Fort William.</p><p>Discussions are going on about the possibility of a dedicated Gaelic school in Edinburgh, the nation's capital city, and we are all aware of the success of the Glasgow Gaelic school and the increasing reputation of the Inverness Gaelic school.</p><p>We have increased our support for Gaelic-medium education throughout Scotland. As Ken Macintosh said, we have made capital support available to authorities that would like to make progress with Gaelic-medium schools. We have also supported Gaelic teacher recruitment for reviewing Gaelic early-years education. We have increased provision for a range of education projects that B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig will implement.</p><p>The Government's funding for resources to support teachers and pupils in Gaelic education is at an unprecedented level. There is no question <place-holder colnum=\"12717\"/> about the Government's and the Parliament's commitment to Gaelic-medium education in Scotland.</p><p>The motion that we are debating refers to the importance of the survival of Gaelic as a community language. The presence of Gaelic in our lives and culture enriches every one of us. However, it is essential that we have a living language community to support that and that we give thought to how we strengthen and grow the community. That issue was discussed at a recent conference in Lewis that focused on growing Gaelic in communities. It was a good day: new initiatives were put in place and new funding was made available. It is vital that we maintain momentum in this very important area. It is important, too, that B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig gives further thought to how matters can be taken forward. I have written to it in that regard.</p><p>Gaelic is in a fragile condition. We cannot be complacent, but like others I believe that we are at a critical point. I am very encouraged by the desire to support Gaelic that I find in Scottish public life, and I am encouraged by the commitment and vitality that I have found with Gaelic speakers, learners and supporters. Even this week, there have been encouraging signs of vitality. The Scottish Parliament's Gaelic plan has been launched, while a book of Gaelic poetry was launched last night. A new Gaelic novel was published today in Glasgow, and later this evening we have the final of the Gaelic high schools debating competition.<place-holder colnum=\"12718\"/></p><p>Those developments, and many more, are reasons for optimism and confidence, and our duty is to maintain progress, use the initiatives that have been put in place and work to ensure a secure future for Gaelic so that the language will continue to play a significant role in Scottish society and cultural life. I totally support the motion, and I am confident that all members will be able to support the necessary steps that will ensure the survival of Gaelic as a community language in Scotland.

I encourage the people involved to continue to build on the connections that they have already made with the Scottish Arts Council, EventScotland, Renfrewshire Council&#8212;which has been absolutely ace in the way that it has supported the event&#8212;Making Music Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.</p><p>There is no doubt that local festivals always bring many benefits. As well as the financial benefits, they provide a sense of community, an inflow of tourists and&#8212;as Bill Wilson mentioned&#8212;an opportunity for people to participate in cultural activities. As Annabel Goldie and Wendy Alexander said, such festivals not only provide performances by leading artists&#8212;the Paisley festival is a class example&#8212;but involve local young people, which is particularly good. That should carry on. A sense of achievement and of community spirit comes from performing with local choirs and taking part in workshops on singing. The festival builds a sense of community, pride in Paisley's past&#8212;which is clearly evident&#8212;and a distinct culture in the west of Scotland. At a concert last week or the week before, I was told that about 3,000 people now participate.</p><p>Last year, I was able to attend the Starlight Youth Music Theatre event, which was a mark of exactly what Annabel Goldie talked about. I was also able to attend the last Sunday afternoon concert&#8212;when they had the Sunday afternoon concerts&#8212;which involved Cadenza, an Edinburgh-based choir, and the Russian choir that is based in Glasgow. That was an absolutely super way to spend a Sunday afternoon. I was interested to hear that Wendy Alexander had received an e-mail from Jennie Hynd, because I met Jennie that afternoon. That was another delight that Paisley brought me&#8212;I knew her many years ago through work, and Jennie was hugely enthusiastic about the benefits that the festival was bringing to Paisley.</p><p>The festival committee has built up good connections with the local community and with educational, cultural and local government bodies. That kind of outward-looking attitude can draw attention to Paisley itself&#8212;highlighting a community that is justly proud of its heritage and confident in its future.</p><p>Many of the performances at the festival have been noted by other members. I was interested to hear Annabel Goldie talk about Paisley's aspirations to host the Mod. A marked characteristic of the people running the festival is that they are outward looking and willing to grasp opportunities. This year, in a first for the festival, there was a gathering of Gaelic choirs, which marked Paisley's newly formed branch of An <place-holder colnum=\"12480\"/> Comunn Gaidhealach. The community is moving towards that aspiration.</p><p>I understand that Paisley is unique in having a festival dedicated solely to choral music, and it is good that the festival has been supported by the organisations that I mentioned earlier when responding to Hugh Henry. Making Music Scotland is worthy of particular mention: it is one of the 13 volunteer committees in Making Music, which is the UK's largest umbrella body for amateur music. The National Youth Choir of Scotland is also worth a mention. It comprises national choirs and 11 area choirs, which have had a tremendous impact in encouraging singing among children. They do something that is very important for people's sense of wellbeing: they maintain an emphasis on fun. An esoteric performance can be wonderful and a great privilege to see, but we should never forget the importance of straightforward fun. The youth music initiative and the National Youth Choir of Scotland have worked together to ensure that many children can have that fun.</p><p>After only four short years, the Paisley choral festival is decidedly on the map and its success has been acknowledged. As the organisers know, success depends on hard work in dealing with administration, raising funds and building relationships. The organisers have proved beyond doubt that they are more than capable of doing that work. I know that Parliament will join me in wishing the festival every success in the future.<place-holder time=\"17:37:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:37.</em></p>", "hdate": "2008-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14227485", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voices in Paisley"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much acknowledge and support the ambitions for the Paisley festival.

It is timeous because of the forthcoming by-election and the first part of the switchover in the Borders. As we have heard, the Selkirk transmitter will begin its switchover tomorrow, which is a major step in broadcasting in this country.</p><p>Members' speeches have been welcome. There is consensus, so I hope that we will all move <place-holder colnum=\"12073\"/> forward together to try to get the best possible outcome for people in the Borders and beyond. As has been said and as everyone is aware, digital switchover is reserved to the UK Government, and I understand that the matter was raised with UK ministers by MPs from the Borders and elsewhere in a debate at Westminster on 14 October.</p><p>Obviously, the Scottish Government is extremely keen for the switchover to go smoothly in Scotland. I have on a number of occasions met representatives of Digital UK to discuss progress and to press Scotland's case. I met Digital UK representatives on 29 October to establish whether the Selkirk transmitter switchover was progressing according to plan and whether, in its view, people in the Scottish Borders were ready for switchover. The response that I received was positive, and there was discussion about the pilot in Whitehaven in Cumbria. Digital UK's figures show that by August, 88 per cent of main sets in the Borders and 40 per cent of secondary sets were ready for switchover. The figure for main sets is now up at around 90 per cent.</p><p>Many areas of the Borders are served by relay transmitters, as we have heard, and the people who are served by them will not get the full service until much later. As has been mentioned here, we will not know until tomorrow the total effect of the switchover scheme, given the number of relay transmitters.</p><p>I understand the concerns that have been expressed by everyone. Digital UK has informed me that seven advice points will be operating&#8212;in Duns, Galashiels, Eyemouth, Hawick, Peebles, Jedburgh and Kelso. The centres will be open for three days, around both switchover days, and will be staffed by Digital UK and help scheme staff. The Digital UK call centres will be able to provide advice to anyone who cannot make it to an advice point. Scottish Borders Council and local voluntary sector groups will provide crucial support, and I hope that their support is visible. Christine Grahame was quite right to point out that a lot of people who say that they are aware of what is going on do not really understand what has to be done.</p><p>That brings me to the help scheme, which Jeremy Purvis mentions in his motion. The scheme was established to give help to those who need it most. The UK Government recently announced that the help scheme will be extended to all people living in care homes who have been, or will be, resident for six months. That change is welcomed by the Scottish Government. It came up at the Local Government and Communities Committee, and Shona Robison, on behalf of the Scottish Government, wrote to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport about the matter to ensure that people who receive free personal care <place-holder colnum=\"12074\"/> will not miss out on the help scheme. I have been advised that the information pack was sent to everyone who was eligible for it. In the Scottish Borders, that covered 16,000 people. I also understand that reminders were sent out.</p><p>Uptake of the help scheme in the Borders, according to the most recent figures that I have, was about 15 per cent. However, the response rate among the eligible people whom I mentioned was much higher: about two thirds responded, either to accept or to say that they did not wish assistance. As Christine Grahame said, the situation might, however, become apparent when the time comes. People can access the help scheme beyond tomorrow. It will be open to eligible people until the switchover in the Border Television region is complete. That will be in July 2009, when the Caldbeck transmitter switches over.</p><p>I am very much aware of the concern that rural areas are receiving a poorer service. More people in such areas receive their television signal from a relay transmitter and, as Ted Brocklebank and John Lamont pointed out, some areas in Scotland and Wales suffer because of that.</p><p>The plan is for everyone in the Borders to continue to get public service broadcasting services. At this point, I will pick up on something that Jeremy Purvis said about any new Scottish digital channel. The Broadcasting Commission report recommended that that network should be carried, like all other public service broadcasters, on the public service broadcast multiplex. It should therefore be available to all. We should keep pushing for that.</p><p>Pauline McNeill and John Lamont brought up the subject of digital radio, and different issues must be discussed in that regard. I recently met DCMS, together with its agent, and the Government will respond to its consultation.</p><p>Digital switchover in the Borders is the first such exercise in Scotland following the pilot scheme in Whitehaven. We all hope that it goes well and we will keep our eye on it.</p><p>On working with the UK Government, I want everyone to be assured that discussions have been on-going. I will send a copy of the <em>Official Report</em> of the debate to Westminster to show that there is genuine concern to ensure that people are not disadvantaged. It will be useful for Westminster to see the strength of feeling about BBC Alba, for example, which is so important to us all&#8212;we really must push to have it on Freeview.</p><p>Please be assured that, as far as I am concerned, the move forward with digitalisation is a joint initiative and Scotland's case will always be pressed by this Government. Anyone who feels that they can usefully contribute to that should not <place-holder colnum=\"12075\"/> hesitate to do so. I hope that all Borders representatives will keep us informed of their perspective on how things are progressing with the digital switchover.<place-holder colnum=\"12076\"/><place-holder time=\"17:35:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:35.</em></p>", "hdate": "2008-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14206733", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Digital Switchover"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Jeremy Purvis for bringing the debate to Parliament.

DFID is indeed a huge player in international development, and that is why everything that we do is done in consultation with DFID.

That is why, in partnership with the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, we fund the civil society organisation CONGOMA&#8212;the Council For Non-Governmental Organisations In Malawi. We have also funded the Scotland Malawi Partnership to investigate whether there is a need for a corresponding presence in Malawi to support the development of civil society links. I will let the committee and the Parliament know the outcome of that work when the results are available.</p><p>Another recurring theme in the debate was the expansion of our focus to include Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Darfur region of Sudan. Let me be clear about that. As I told the committee when I gave evidence to it, we have not expanded our focus in sub-Saharan Africa.

Members agreed that it was right for the previous Government to put in place a humanitarian response to the awful events in Sri Lanka, so the inclusion of the Indian subcontinent in the international development policy is not completely new.</p><p>Des McNulty raised the issue of humanitarian assistance. It is clear that we will respond to humanitarian crises through the Disasters Emergency Committee.

It is very tempting to say that people in Malawi could do with this or that, but we must focus on what we are funding. The new policy adopts a focused approach. Where the transportation of specific equipment is an essential and proportionate part of the activities of a specific programme, and where there is evidence that the equipment cannot be sourced in the country or in other parts of Africa, we will consider funding it as part of the programme allocation.

The last of those themes has been included because we deem human rights to be extremely important.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank and Michael Matheson mentioned the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which is hugely important in addressing the issues that Robin Harper raised.

We should not pretend that we are the experts. That is why everything that we do is led by people in the field, who have the necessary knowledge and experience.</p><p>Fair trade is hugely important. The UK is the member state, but there have been discussions between my officials, officials in the procurement directorate and officials responsible for procurement at UK level. At First Minister's question time, the First Minister has stated that we are committed to those discussions. There seems to be cross-party support for upping the ante on the issue.

The depth and breadth of the committee's inquiry was extensive and like the Scottish Government's public review&#8212;given the holistic approach that the Government takes in all that it does&#8212;it has engaged many sectors of the international development community in Scotland.</p><p>Without a doubt, there are many views on what we should and should not be doing, but there is one genuine aim: the fight against world poverty. We all share that desire and many of the committee's recommendations have been addressed in our new policy and our revised funding approach.</p><p>International development is a complex issue. There are no quick fixes or easy answers because conditions and circumstances vary from country to country, from region to region and from community to community. That is why we took time to ensure that our policy focuses on the priorities of the people who are in greatest need and that it is supported by a robust and transparent funding process. Without that, we cannot deliver the measurable and sustainable outcomes for which we all strive.<place-holder colnum=\"10863\"/></p><p>The sector has recognised and acknowledged that the Scottish Government has listened through each stage of our policy development. A number of inputs have informed our new policy. Those include consideration of the responses to the public review of the existing policy; the experience to date of the Scottish Government in operating the previous international development policy; the intelligence that has been gained from an independent review of Scottish Government funded activity in Malawi; and, of course, on-going discussions with the Government of Malawi.</p><p>The independent review that I mentioned was undertaken by LTS International. Its purpose was twofold: to look at Scottish Government funded activity in Malawi and to consider our related procedures and processes. We will publish information on the findings of that review shortly. That is an important piece of work, which is informing on-going programme implementation. I want to take time to ensure that the final document is useful for a wide range of stakeholders and that it can assist in the development of best practice in the international development sector in Scotland. We look forward to continuing to work closely with the Network of International Development Organisations in Scotland and the Scotland Malawi Partnership.</p><p>Members will recall that when I gave evidence to the committee in May, I stressed that the new policy adopted a very different approach&#8212;an approach that has been welcomed by NIDOS, the Scotland Malawi Partnership and the Government of Malawi. The process has been challenging, but necessary. Having considered all the evidence, we were clear on what we needed to do to build on progress to date and strengthen the approach. In that respect, I commend the sector not only for rising to and meeting this challenge but for its collaborative approach.</p><p>Our international development policy forms part of the wider international framework and illustrates the Scottish Government's commitment to Scotland's place as a responsible nation in the world, ready to play its part in tackling the global issue of poverty and facilitating economic growth for all. Since my appearance before the European and External Relations Committee in May, much has been done. We have undertaken a funding round for the Malawi development programme, launched a funding round for the sub-Saharan Africa development programme and participated in a joint permanent commission for co-operation official review meeting in Malawi. Our policy reflects our desire to listen and to ensure that the recipient country's needs and priorities are paramount and form the basis for Scottish Government engagement.<place-holder colnum=\"10864\"/></p><p>As I said, in August officials attended the joint permanent commission for co-operation official review meeting, which built on the discussions of my visit to Malawi in February. Our new funding approach and focus, which were outlined by officials, were warmly welcomed by Government of Malawi representatives. There was a particular welcome for the inclusion of the cross-cutting themes of vocational education and training, gender issues and equality, enterprise development and strengthening the context for enhanced human rights and civil society development. Those themes reflect the priorities in the Malawi growth and development strategy, and help us to focus activities within the strands of the co-operation agreement and develop a stronger programme.</p><p>The Government of Malawi welcomed our commitment to continuing to work closely with it and, as a reflection of that ethos, colleagues in Malawi are commenting on short-listed proposals. We have implemented a new requirement for applicants to provide evidence of consultation with the Government of Malawi&#8212;an approach that that Government has strongly supported.</p><p>In July, we opened a funding round for the Malawi development programme. Although I appreciate that some of the changes to the application process were challenging, I believe that the increased rigour was necessary and has already led to an increase in quality. The sector has certainly risen admirably to the challenge.</p><p>We received 65 applications for work in Malawi, which is more than in any other funding round. Moreover, the quality of applications was noticeably higher than in previous rounds, which suggests that the new process did not present a significant barrier to the majority of the sector.</p><p>Members will recall that during my appearance before the European and External Relations Committee I announced that I had agreed a three-year contribution to the core funding of NIDOS and the Scotland Malawi Partnership. That funding is now in place and both organisations have received their funding allocations for this financial year, which fulfils our policy commitment to supporting networking and information exchange in Scotland.</p><p>We have made good progress on the sub-Saharan Africa development programme. After a call for concept notes in June, we received 26 such notes, covering the four countries that had been identified. Again, applicants have risen to the challenge: the quality of the concept notes was very high. We have invited 15 organisations to submit full applications, which will be considered by our independent assessors and reviewed by the Scottish Government. We will announce the results later this year.<place-holder colnum=\"10865\"/></p><p>The newest element of our policy is the Indian subcontinent development programme, which is being developed. Decisions on the funding process will be informed by discussions with the relevant communities in Scotland to assess the focus, to inform us where Scotland can add value and to examine the mechanism for operating that aspect of the policy.</p><p>On fair trade, I was pleased that the Scottish Fair Trade Forum had the opportunity to contribute to the evidence sessions during the committee's inquiry. Much of the work in establishing the forum has been done and it is now carrying forward the fair trade nation campaign. The forum also continues to build strong ties with many high-profile stakeholders.</p><p>Fair trade is a complex issue, particularly with regard to public sector procurement, so I will continue to pursue ways in which we can strengthen the guidance to encourage the use of fair trade goods where appropriate. As many members do, I care about the issue and I remain committed to keeping it on the agenda. The Scottish Government is committed to Scotland achieving fair trade nation status and will continue to work with the Scottish Fair Trade Forum on that. It is essential that when Scotland receives fair trade nation status, that status is meaningful. It should not be a matter of paying lip service to it.</p><p>In a debate that we had on fair trade in March last year, I said to the then Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Patricia Ferguson&#8212;who is also committed to Scotland having fair trade nation status&#8212;that the issue is far too important to argue over, that we ought to work together to get things sorted, and that we ought to take the appropriate advice from where we can get it. I stand by what I said. I think that we are all committed to achieving fair trade nation status for Scotland and can work together to achieve it. I know that the chair of the Scottish Fair Trade Forum, John McAllion, has been dealing with Patricia Ferguson to get a cross-party group on fair trade issues up and running. I hope that we have constructive dialogue on moving that forward.</p><p>I look forward to hearing what colleagues have to say on the report. Whatever our differences in approach, we all have a common aim in our international development work: the eradication of global poverty. I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and Parliament and, of course, I look forward to continuing to work with Pauline McNeill who will, I understand, have a central role on international development issues for the Labour group, because we all care about ensuring that our international development work supports those who are in greatest need to help themselves and to contribute to the long-term aim of establishing sustainable and vibrant communities.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14002440", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Development"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the committee on securing the debate.

Sufficient flexibility needs to be built into the new points-based system to allow employers to bring in the skills that they need when those skills cannot be found locally. We are pressing the Home Office for further flexibilities in the UK's managed migration system, so that we can continue to attract and retain people in key areas of economic activity.

The lists were compiled by the Migration Advisory Committee using, in part, evidence from employers on where shortages in the labour market might effectively be filled by migration. As well as the Government and its officials being in contact with the MAC throughout the process of collecting evidence, representatives of the south Asian restaurant industry fed in their views and I understand that they also attended discussions in Glasgow earlier this year.</p><p>Skilled chefs are included in the UK list and, to clarify what members have said, it is only skilled chefs who are, as we have heard, earning at least &#163;8.10 per hour after deductions for accommodation, meals and so on. Those who are at national vocational qualification level 3, as discussed by Brian Adam, are not on the shortage occupation list.</p><p>Restaurateurs also have a responsibility to ensure that local people are given the necessary opportunities and skills to become contributing members of society&#8212;many restaurateurs do that.

We could have dissolved the Scottish Arts Council through the Privy Council but, with the agreement of the Privy Council, we decided to take the opportunity to combine the abolition of the Scottish Arts Council with the legislation to establish creative Scotland.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank and others raised the issue of the ministerial power of direction. We listened to what consultees said in their responses to the draft culture (Scotland) bill and the Creative Scotland Bill says that creative Scotland will have an arm's-length relationship with Government. For the first time, legislation will state that the Scottish ministers may not give creative Scotland any direction as to who or which cultural practices it can or cannot fund. I have heard Labour members say that that was always the case, but that position has never been stated in legislation before. It is now clearly established. I find it quite amusing that one Labour member after another said that there had always been a hands-off approach and then condemned me for not interfering in the Scottish Arts Council's decisions on flexible funding. They should all have been as sensible as Jamie Stone was on that point.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank was concerned about the power of direction. However, the power that is available to ministers is to ensure the good governance and financial propriety of creative Scotland, which is fully in line with the approach to all non-departmental public bodies.</p><p>Some members mentioned that our approach should not be solely concerned with economic benefits and Cathy Peattie said that there was too much of an economic emphasis in the bill. However, we amended the draft culture (Scotland) bill in order to remove its emphasis on the <place-holder colnum=\"9886\"/> economic benefits of arts and culture. The relevant section of the Creative Scotland Bill now tasks creative Scotland with pursuing a range of benefits without attaching priority to any one in particular.</p><p>Various members mentioned the financial memorandum. As I explained to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee and the Finance Committee, we introduced the bill before the budget for the transformation of the two organisations was settled because we wanted to establish the new organisation as soon as possible. As Aileen Campbell noted, the 2003 speech by the then First Minister was inspiring, but it was followed by consultation after consultation, a commission and then a draft bill. We felt that we owed it to the sector to get on with creating creative Scotland, because that was what the overwhelming majority of respondents wanted.</p><p>James Kelly mentioned the estimates.

I reiterate why the Government is promoting the bill, and promoting it now. In Scotland we have a dynamic, successful and internationally renowned cultural life. Our artists, writers, film makers, musicians and practitioners of all kinds are celebrated across the world. Our festivals, including the Edinburgh international film festival, which begins tonight, are world class in every sense of the word.</p><p>In every part of Scotland, communities celebrate their identity through culture. Local authorities, volunteers and many others bring enjoyment and fulfilment through cultural activities. Our creative enterprises are breaking into new markets across the world. They now support 60,000 jobs and contribute over &#163;4 billion to the wealth of Scotland. Because of those successes and our ambitions for the future, we think that the time is right for the bill.</p><p>We want Scotland to be recognised as Europe's most creative nation&#8212;a nation that attracts and retains talent and in which the arts and our creative community are supported and celebrated and their contribution to the economy is maximised. It would not have been sufficient for us to pursue our aims through a reform of one or other of the existing bodies, or through a merger. Make do and mend will not do for our ambitions&#8212;we want a new body with modern functions and new objectives. We want creative Scotland to inspire an excellence that is the leading, confident edge of an aspirant nation.</p><p>I turn to the bill and to what creative Scotland will do, how it will innovate and with whom it will work in partnership. I record my thanks to the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, the Finance Committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee for their consideration of the bill. In my comments, I will try to offer the clarification that colleagues have sought.</p><p>Creative Scotland will be our national development body for the arts and culture, working with partners to support the creative industries. Its remit will encompass all the present functions and <place-holder colnum=\"9843\"/> activities of the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen, including the promotion of the arts, culture, film and screen. We envisage four roles for creative Scotland. First, it will promote an increasingly wide understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of the arts and culture. Secondly, it will identify, support and develop talent and excellence in the arts and culture. Thirdly, it will seek to realise all the benefits of the arts and culture.

The acting chief executive of the Scottish Arts Council is working with the Scottish Government and representatives of local government to develop guidance notes for community planning partnerships that aim to widen access to culture locally. Creative Scotland will build on and widen those links.</p><p>Creative Scotland will continue to make capital investments in Scotland's cultural infrastructure and will work closely with the voluntary sector.

I have now considered that report and confirm that the Government has accepted each of its recommendations, which envisage exactly the ambitious and creative partnership working that will be crucial to creative Scotland's success. That partnership will be represented in a creative industries forum convened by creative Scotland. The forum will act as a catalyst, bringing together the public bodies that are involved in supporting the creative industries to ensure that services are effectively co-ordinated, and to share intelligence in a way that will stimulate innovation. Its first task will be to develop a route map for creative entrepreneurs that shows how to access services easily and make the best of them.

Edinburgh is a fantastic base for artistic organisations and NAYO has provided many opportunities for young people to participate in and experience orchestral music over the years, as have our Scotland-based youth orchestras.</p><p>NAYO represents youth orchestras throughout Scotland and provides encouragement, advice and access to key opportunities. The annual festival of British youth orchestras is a fantastic example of the contribution that NAYO makes to the development of young musical talent; it is NAYO's largest and most exciting annual event and it takes place during three weeks in August as part of the Edinburgh festival fringe. What an opportunity it presents! Last year's festival involved 43 concerts over 21 days in Glasgow and Edinburgh. The participants came from far and wide and included the Fife Youth Jazz Orchestra, the West of Scotland Schools Ensemble, Moray Concert Brass Band, Perth Youth Big Band, an orchestra from Kent, and Darlington and Dales Youth Orchestra. This year, we will have the orchestra from Kent, an orchestra from Shropshire and the National Youth Wind Ensemble.</p><p>Although NAYO has committed to continuing the festival of British youth orchestras in Edinburgh for 2008 and 2009, we all urge it to make a further commitment, regardless of the outcome of its consultation. After all, where would such a festival be better held in the UK than in Edinburgh, which has the world's biggest cultural festival? Where else could be deemed better?</p><p>There is a wealth of outstanding orchestral and instrumental opportunities for young musicians in Scotland. I will continue to work with them all and with colleagues in the sector to ensure that the musical landscape in Scotland flourishes.</p><p>The Scottish Arts Council supports a vast range of youth orchestras. The RSAMD, which Mr Chisholm mentioned, and our national performing companies continue to provide a range of opportunities for young amateur and budding professional musicians.</p><p>The Scottish Arts Council has funded various NAYO projects over the past 10 years. In 2004, the lottery money that the Scottish Arts Council <place-holder colnum=\"9002\"/> distributed was provided to the new festival of youth choirs, which was integrated with the festival of British youth orchestras.</p><p>Under the youth music initiative, NAYO has had support, along with the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and the National Youth Choir of Scotland. I know that NAYO is ambitious for its future and the future of its members throughout the UK. Whatever the outcome of the consultation process, it must continue to work with our young people and organisations in Edinburgh and throughout Scotland in supporting that talent and inspiration and the determination of our young musicians to make great music.</p><p>Of course we would prefer NAYO to choose to stay in Edinburgh. I, like Ian McKee, Malcolm Chisholm, Ted Brocklebank, Aileen Campbell and the City of Edinburgh Council, urge NAYO to consider just what a fantastic base Edinburgh is for an orchestra organisation.</p><p>I would not like to close the debate without mentioning the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, the National Youth Choir of Scotland, the national youth pipe band of Scotland and the National Youth Brass Band of Scotland. The Scottish Arts Council has been having a hard time lately, in the chamber and beyond, but I have to say that those organisations&#8212;our youth organisations&#8212;are all well supported by the Scottish Arts Council and they are going from strength to strength. They will continue to do so, because underpinning everything they do is an absolute love for and celebration of the music they produce. The people who work with them, some of whom are volunteers, have an absolute commitment to seeing that flourish. It will continue to flourish. We would prefer that it continued to flourish with the presence of the National Association of Youth Orchestras here in Edinburgh, which is a natural place for it to be.

The debate gives the chamber the opportunity to discuss the principles that underpin the Government's approach to its international activities.</p><p>I want to address, right at the start of the debate, the important question of international development policy and the amendment in the name of Malcolm Chisholm. As I discussed with the European and External Relations Committee last week, the Government's international framework is exactly that&#8212;the framework from which fall detailed action plans and specific policies. I am pleased to have published the international development policy today, which reflects the commitment made in the framework for an increased international development fund. The policy document is available at the back of the chamber and I look forward to discussing it in detail with the European and External Relations Committee at our forthcoming session. Although I recognise absolutely the sentiment and commitment behind the Labour amendment, I ask that Mr Chisholm consider withdrawing it in the spirit of the framework and the international development policy.</p><p>I was happy to discuss the framework and the accompanying draft action plan on European engagement with the European and External Relations Committee on Tuesday last week. It seems there is consensus about much of the work that is undertaken at international level. The committee is due thanks for its work in convening evidence-taking sessions on the Scottish Government's approach to international activities. Those sessions were extremely valuable to us in finalising our strategy.</p><p>The sessions that the Government held on our international framework and our China plan were also extremely valuable. I am pleased to announce that the refreshed China plan has been published today. It shows how aspirations can become concrete actions by developing joint opportunities in education, trade, science, tourism and culture. I expect that members have picked up a copy from the back of the chamber. I look forward to discussing the plan with the cross-party <place-holder colnum=\"8299\"/> group on China, as I confirmed to my colleague, Gil Paterson, at the European and External Relations Committee last week.</p><p>I am clear that the objectives that I have set for the Scottish Government's international activities are tied to the Government economic strategy. The objectives are: to create the conditions for talented people to live, learn, work, visit and remain in Scotland so that Scottish population growth matches the European Union average; to bring a sharp economic growth focus to the promotion of Scotland abroad so that the Scottish gross domestic product growth rate matches that of the United Kingdom by 2011; and to manage Scotland's reputation as a distinctive global identity&#8212;an independent-minded and responsible nation at home and abroad that is confident of its place in the world.</p><p>Although there is alignment of our resources around the GES targets, our activity has a fresh emphasis. We will develop closer relations on international work between the Scottish Government, Scottish Development International, VisitScotland, EventScotland and creative Scotland. The recent strategic, better-targeted, more business-focused, efficient and cost-effective Scotland week in North America is an early example of that strategy. We are willing to challenge the UK line to ensure that Scotland's voice is heard, while being proactive in using the UK resources that are at our disposal. We will recognise where Scotland's excellence lies and focus on those areas. We are confident about focusing on Scotland's reputation as a nation, not a region.</p><p>The pursuit of trade, tourism and inward investment remains at the heart of our work and persists as a reason for having Scottish affairs offices in North America and China. That, in turn, entails positioning Scotland as a great place to live, learn, visit, work and remain in.</p><p>The framework document does not seek to list all the international work across the Scottish Government. We agree with the Scots who have told us that Government and the public sector should be agile and fleet of foot. We will monitor and evaluate the activities that we undertake, although we will take a strategic viewpoint and get involved when there is good reason. Activity for its own sake is not productive; the work of Government is to provide the conditions for exchange, not to risk hindering others as they seek to make the civic, Scottish, UK, EU or global partnerships that are the platform for their success.</p><p>We will focus Government intervention on areas that will pay dividends, such as the work that I kicked off last week with the consular corps in Scotland. I made a commitment that the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"8300\"/> Government will work with the corps in a structured and professional way&#8212;and to our mutual advantage&#8212;to ensure effective communication of our aspirations with regard to Scotland's place in the world.</p><p>Although our scope for taking part in international affairs is constrained by the current devolution settlement, we have offices in Brussels and officials who work solely on Scottish affairs in the UK embassies in Beijing and Washington. Alongside them, around 80 staff work in offices abroad for Scottish Development International, the arm of Government that promotes international trade and inward investment. However, that still means that fewer than 100 people work professionally for us furth of Scotland.</p><p>The key message, therefore, is the need for a flexible pragmatism. Scotland looks to the Scottish Government to provide strategic direction, to be able to identify key points of leverage and to respond swiftly. The framework focuses the actions and policies of the Scottish Government and other public sector players to maximise their impact on the performance of team Scotland. As I have said, last month's Scotland week in North America delivered the most ambitious programme of events around tartan day ever undertaken by Scottish ministers&#8212;and at around half the cost of previous years' celebrations.</p><p>Adopting a fleet-footed, agile approach does not mean that we will cease to work closely with our existing partners. However, I am convinced that the targeted memorandum of understanding for education purposes that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning signed last month with the Chinese Ministry of Education delivers mutual benefits more effectively than wide-ranging co-operation agreements. We will continue to work on projects of benefit with regions where we have previously had such agreements. However, we will be led by benefit and opportunity. Under this Government, exchanges between Scotland and Shandong, Victoria, Catalonia and other areas have continued.</p><p>A more responsive approach requires the Scottish Government to work in an integrated way across the public sector and to find new, agile ways of reaching out more widely to civic society in order to share information. Of course, the action plans and policies that fall from the international framework will set out our detailed aims and targets for our key policies. However, people with experience have told us repeatedly that, instead of focusing on a multiplicity of targets, we must put our energy into taking a more responsive and coherent approach.</p><p>That brings me to the Conservative amendment in the name of Mr Brocklebank. By quoting back to us from our framework document, Mr Brocklebank <place-holder colnum=\"8301\"/> and his colleagues seem to have recognised the value of this Government's strategic approach and our commitment to working with all relevant partners to achieve the best for Scotland. I am therefore pleased to accept the amendment.</p><p>I am sorry, but I cannot say the same about the Liberal Democrat amendment in the name of Mr Smith. Let me make it plain: this Government for Scotland has a vision and aspirations for our nation that are explicit in their clarity, truthfulness and direction. Scotland expects no less from the Scottish National Party, the First Minister and his Government. No less should be expected from Government in any democracy&#8212;I would have thought that liberal-minded politicians of any party would take that as a given. For members to suggest that ministers in this Government would flip-flop around, change their minds on a daily basis and hide things from Scots shows that they have no understanding whatever of the deeply-held beliefs in conviction and honesty that are at the heart of this Government.</p><p>I ask members not to play that silly Lib Dem game but to keep watch on today's main target&#8212;an international framework that we all agree can increase Scotland's competitive edge by supporting the conditions for talented people to live, learn, work, visit and remain in Scotland. I am sure that members will want to feed into the framework and I look forward to hearing from them about how we can work together towards that end.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises the importance of ensuring that Scotland is competitive in an increasingly globalised society; agrees that creating the conditions for talented people to live, learn, visit, work and remain in Scotland is crucial to helping to deliver the goals of growing Scotland's population and economy in a sustainable way, and welcomes the Scottish Government's International Framework as a means to extend, focus and align the actions and policies of the government and public sector partners to these ends.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13642948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is good to have the opportunity today to discuss the Scottish Government's international framework.

Elizabeth Smith has obviously been doing a bit of that as well, when she considered the Scandinavian models of education. In doing that, we are determined to take the opportunity to promote what we are good at to others. We want to promote our vision of a smarter Scotland&#8212;as a place to learn as well as to live, visit, work, do business and invest. Telling Scotland's story and letting people know what we are good at is central to delivering the Government's economic strategy.

Building links and exchanges is a key part of delivering our policies. For example, the Scottish Qualifications Authority promotes Scottish qualifications and products and supports Scottish universities and colleges to attract overseas students to our excellent institutions. Learning and Teaching Scotland's approach to Confucius classrooms was promoted to Hanban, which described the initiative as world leading and a model for others to follow.

An understanding of linguistic diversity is an integral part of what we mean by international education. It is not just about learning modern languages in the traditional sense&#8212;although, as our commitment to introducing a Scottish baccalaureate in languages demonstrates, we want Scottish young people to be ambitious in that regard. That ties in with what Bashir Ahmad was saying about how few pupils over the years have been able to go on to work in Europe&#8212;and indeed further afield&#8212;and to benefit from the advantages of being part of the European Union. Such ambitions are important to us, and we <place-holder colnum=\"7915\"/> are moving ahead in that regard.

I do not believe that anyone in the chamber doubts that. It forms part of European and world history. Elizabeth Smith emphasised Scottish history, which she was keen for us not to leave out of the equation, referring to the Scottish enlightenment in particular, but pupils can have many experiences to inform them about all those things and to give them a greater understanding, and Holocaust education is one of those. The fact is that the &#163;152,000 came over as a Barnett consequential in 2006-07, when the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats were in power. I point out to Mr Macintosh that they did not hand that money over to any trust. They simply said that the money went into the Scottish block.

He is right: in the eight <place-holder colnum=\"7836\"/> minutes that are available to me, I will not have enough time to respond to everything that has been said.</p><p>It is clear from the debate how much our historic environment and our heritage mean to everyone. Examples have been given across the chamber. There is competition. Liam McArthur spoke about the beauty of Orkney, and Malcolm Chisholm spoke about his constituency having the most listed buildings. Rutherglen town hall, Mackintosh buildings in the west of Scotland, the urban and the rural have been mentioned. Christopher Harvie gave a history lesson on the importance of preservation and how we previously nearly lost so much. He talked about the world heritage site at New Lanark, which is a fine example of the fact that our heritage is about more than buildings&#8212;it is about our identity, culture and sense of community, which New Lanark has had and continues to have.</p><p>Many members mentioned particular Historic Scotland cases. I would like to put things in context. Between 2005 and 2008, Historic Scotland received 798 applications for scheduled monument consent, of which 797 were approved; only one was refused. In the same period, 7,094 applications for listed building consent were made, of which 99.84 per cent were approved; only 11 cases were called in. There will always be a few cases that concern people, and some of those cases were mentioned in the debate.</p><p>I do not have enough time to respond to all the concerns that were expressed, but I would like to say where matters lie with Castle Tioram. Ministers refused an application relating to Castle Tioram following a public inquiry. Since then, the owner has stated his intention to submit a fresh proposal. No new proposal has been lodged yet, although I understand that Historic Scotland would be happy to consider one. If members want further information on other cases, I am happy to provide that.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm commented that I previously said in response to the HEACS report that the balance between local authorities and Historic Scotland was about right. It is indeed about right in respect of basic legal duties, but our joint working agreement is about day-to-day administrative working. No extra work is involved in the new arrangement. Historic Scotland is happy to provide support throughout the country to assist authorities, but the aim is to prevent duplication.</p><p>Willie Coffey mentioned the audit of local authority resources. I did not see the point in holding up work on moving forward to clear duplication. I am conducting the audit as a pilot rather than undertaking it in all local authorities, as John Farquhar Munro said, because I believe that it is worth seeing how it works initially without <place-holder colnum=\"7837\"/> going into it wholesale. The idea has been welcomed by local authorities generally and in particular by the three local authorities in which we are piloting it. The work that will be subject to delegation is already being done, so it will have a limited impact on resources. It could even have a positive impact. I am pleased to confirm that, of course, an effective monitoring regime will be an important part of that work.</p><p>It is important that I address Helen Eadie's point that there is a feeling that Historic Scotland is not taking disability issues seriously. I assure her that it is. Historic Scotland has been working hard to make its properties as accessible as possible to the widest range of people. Nevertheless, as she recognised, many of the monuments are difficult to access even for the fittest of us, so there is a fine balance to be struck. Historic Scotland has conducted audits of access to its sites and has a programme of work to deliver better access. She will be pleased to hear that Historic Scotland is drafting its equality policy, which builds on the Scottish Government's policy and will cover disability issues. As is required by law, that work will involve stakeholders.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm asked about battlefields. A SHEP on historic battlefields is due to be issued for public consultation on 30 April. We look forward to receiving contributions on that.</p><p>Skills training is hugely important. Christopher Harvie talked about the necessity of training up people with specialist skills to ensure that we preserve our built heritage properly. Recently, I was happy to launch the national progression award scheme, which includes Scottish vocational qualifications in building craft skills. Stonemasons are hugely important in the work that needs to be done to preserve our built heritage, and Historic Scotland will have apprentices on the first scheme, which starts on 28 April.</p><p>Another issue that was raised concerns the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. I assure members that I am considering carefully the future of RCAHMS. However, I feel strongly that the issue requires more time, as it is absolutely critical that we get it right.</p><p>Members will know&#8212;some have mentioned this&#8212;that, as part of a concordat that is doing the rounds, we are discussing the new single outcome agreements with local authorities. Our discussions with individual councils are at a relatively early stage, so it would not be appropriate for me to say any more about the matter right now. Nevertheless, I welcome the positive way in which local government has engaged with the whole process to date, recognising the opportunity that it offers to reshape completely relations between central Government and local government. <place-holder colnum=\"7838\"/></p><p>Historic Scotland, as a Government agency, is part of that process, and I am pleased to say that officials from Historic Scotland are working closely with their colleagues across the Scottish Government in that regard.</p><p>A big concern that is addressed by Iain Smith's amendment, which I have said that I am happy to accept, boils down to a communication issue&#8212;how well Historic Scotland communicates with its partners and the wider public. I am happy to schedule a meeting with Historic Scotland on that point and to take input from parliamentary colleagues on how I should move the discussion forward. That is vital because our heritage affects every one of us, and every one of us has the right to contribute to anything that is going on around our place.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402623", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Scotland and Local Authorities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The most sensible thing that I have heard Malcolm Chisholm say today is that I will not have enough time.

We recognise its importance as heritage in its own right and for tourism, but it also contributes to sustainability, place making, community identity, local distinctiveness and, of course, employment. It can be sustained only by a broad partnership of owners, government and business working together to secure its future.</p><p>Central to that partnership is the relationship between Historic Scotland, as the national agency that is responsible for the historic environment, and local authorities, which have a broader role in relation to development planning, economic development, culture and education. That close relationship is exemplified in many ways throughout the country, in particular by one of Historic Scotland's major recent initiatives: the creation of the conservation area regeneration scheme. Under the previous Administration, &#163;8 million was allocated for that scheme, with moneys to be released between 2007 and 2012. That fund provides financial assistance for the area-based regeneration and conservation initiatives that local authorities undertake, principally in the historic centres of towns and burghs.</p><p>There was heavy demand for the scheme when it was launched, and 37 separate bids were made that totalled around &#163;19 million. Historic Scotland is currently supporting 18 projects, including those in Stornoway, Kilmarnock, Bo'ness and Banff. The scheme has been a major success and many local authorities have said that they want it to continue. I am sure that colleagues from all parties will be delighted that I am able to announce that Historic Scotland has allocated up to &#163;8 million for a further round of that very popular scheme, which will again be spent over five years. That funding will be targeted at councils that have not yet benefited, and at areas in which existing <place-holder colnum=\"7804\"/> conservation projects can be enhanced with additional resources.</p><p>I am pleased to outline a number of other measures that will improve partnership working and benefit management of our historic environment, in response to points that were made by&#8212;among others&#8212;the Historic Environment Advisory Council for Scotland, in its 2006 report on the role of local government in the historic environment. We have concluded, as part of our commitment to streamlining the public sector, that HEACS does not need to be retained beyond its agreed work plan, which continues. However, the hard work of the council's individual members and the quality of its contribution to debates such as this is hugely appreciated, and I want to record my gratitude for its professionalism across the board.</p><p>Much of the joint working between local authorities and Historic Scotland flows from the agency's role in development planning and management. Local authorities have the opportunity to tap into the wealth of knowledge and experience within the agency, adding value to the wealth of knowledge and experience of their own specialist staff. However, as has been noted many times, there is scope for confusion about roles and overlap of activities.</p><p>Our historic environment is rich and varied. Rightly, we recognise the need to distinguish between what is best managed locally and what needs an element of national protection. Local authorities identify and manage a range of local designations, including heritage areas, archaeology sites and conservation areas, which are areas of local value that have a distinctive character that is important to the community. Historic Scotland is responsible on behalf of ministers for identifying parts of our historic environment that are of particular value at national level&#8212;notably for scheduling monuments such as the stone circle at Brodgar on Orkney and the listing of buildings such as Castlemilk stables in Glasgow, the recent renovation of which was partly funded by Historic Scotland.</p><p>Such designations are intended to help to manage change, not to prevent it. The management of change is largely administered by local authorities in their role as planning authorities. I am sure that Parliament will be pleased to learn that the agency's approach is developing rapidly. It aims to enable all partners to maximise their particular contributions.</p><p>We must protect our heritage while promoting growth and development. Central to that are the new joint working agreements that are being developed in response to demand from local authorities. The agreements will set out what is expected of each partner in relation to management of change in the historic <place-holder colnum=\"7805\"/> environment. They are intended to allow issues to be dealt with as locally as possible and to ensure that Historic Scotland is involved only when it can add value: it should not replicate work that local authorities have already done. Initial discussions have been held between my officials and a number of local authorities, and the joint working agreements will be launched in May. Local authorities will be invited to sign up during the remainder of the year.</p><p>I am pleased to confirm that, when local authorities sign up to the joint working agreements, we will also be able to offer them the opportunity to acquire delegated powers to deal with listed-building casework, as is permitted under planning legislation. That approach has the potential to streamline the current process significantly without any threat to the historic environment. We plan to pilot such schemes with a small number of local authorities this year&#8212;the City of Edinburgh Council, Glasgow City Council and Perth and Kinross Council. I hope that the experience of those early enthusiasts will energise others to follow suit.</p><p>To support all that work and ensure efficient handling, Historic Scotland was included in the wider e-planning programme that the Government is promoting to allow much more to be done online. I am pleased that, this year, Historic Scotland will become fully integrated with the e-planning programme. If local authorities wish, they will be able to consult the agency more quickly and cheaply than previously, which will help to ensure that more planning applications meet the targets that ministers have set. In that context, I announce that I have agreed with Historic Scotland a new key performance target for dealing with planning consultation&#8212;70 per cent within 14 days this year, rising to 90 per cent in 2009-10. The agency already has a target of clearing 97 per cent of listed building consent notifications within 28 days. This year, it exceeded that. The new target shows that Historic Scotland is contributing to the Government's wider agenda through its continuing commitment to the development of a modern, streamlined planning system for Scotland.</p><p>The efficiencies that are created by those modernising initiatives will not be wasted. Instead, they will enable Historic Scotland to give strategic support to local authorities throughout Scotland in ways that are simply not possible at present. I firmly believe that the initiatives will contribute significantly to an even stronger relationship between Historic Scotland and local government.</p><p>Of course, there are many other ways in which local government and Historic Scotland work together, including management of properties in care. The agency has properties in care in every <place-holder colnum=\"7806\"/> local authority area except East Renfrewshire. Its work therefore brings it into contact with local authorities in many ways, such as through formal partnerships, local liaison groups and other initiatives. There is also partnership work with groups that aim to improve access and develop tourism. For example, current initiatives include working to improve the Edinburgh castle tattoo and delivering interpretation in Kilmartin Glen in Argyll and Bute, and at Whithorn priory in Dumfries and Galloway, to name just a couple.</p><p>Partnership working happens on the world stage, too. Historic Scotland and Orkney Islands Council are co-signatories to the statement of intent for the heart of Neolithic Orkney world heritage site. The partners work closely to implement the management plan and arrange access to, and interpretation of, the sites.</p><p>I have outlined new initiatives today: an additional &#163;8 million will go to the conservation area regeneration scheme; there will be a joint working agreement to detail the roles and responsibilities of Historic Scotland and local authorities; there is potential for delegated powers in listed building casework; and there are e-planning integration and the key performance targets. I hope that colleagues throughout the chamber will welcome those initiatives.</p><p>I will use my final minute to say a word about the amendments to the motion. I am pleased to accept the amendment in the name of Malcolm Chisholm. What it proposes will complement what everyone is trying to do to protect our heritage assets. The skills that are required to maintain historic buildings are hugely important. Work is continuing in that regard. In addition, we should take proper account of disability rights and climate change objectives.</p><p>Likewise, I am happy to accept the amendment that Iain Smith lodged on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. There are perceptions that Historic Scotland and local authorities sometimes do not work well enough together to ensure that everyone is informed of the work that they do. I am more than happy to consider that in order to try to improve consultation of local communities, where it is required, on designation of listed buildings and scheduled monuments.</p><p>Unfortunately, much as I would like to accept the amendment in the name of Ted Brocklebank, I am unable to do so. I understand that cases must often be considered on an individual basis, but I feel that what the second part of the amendment proposes would not be particularly helpful for the overall role of all who are concerned to protect our heritage.<place-holder colnum=\"7807\"/></p><p>I commend the motion to Parliament, and I am happy to accept the amendments in the name of Malcolm Chisholm and Iain Smith.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises the unique relationship between Historic Scotland and local authorities in the protection of the nation's historic environment and welcomes initiatives to modernise and simplify that relationship to the benefit of local authorities, Historic Scotland and stakeholders.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402623", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Scotland and Local Authorities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to open the debate, which allows me to highlight the many ways in which central and local government are working together to deliver a sustainable future for Scotland's historic environment.

She spoke about the bad perception of fair trade products. Iain Gray gave us more detail of that from his long memory&#8212;or perhaps it is his long life. In the first debate that we had in the Parliament on fair trade, which was probably in 2000, members talked about the products being perceived as not that good. It is a mark of how far we have come in such a short time that fair trade products are now regarded as mainstream. Someone&#8212;I cannot remember who&#8212;mentioned that Tate &amp; Lyle is starting to use fair trade sugar. That, too, is a mark of how far we have come.</p><p>Since the first debate in the Parliament, we have seen the growth of Fairtrade towns, Fairtrade villages, Fairtrade universities and Fairtrade schools. I am sorry that George Foulkes is not in the chamber, as this is a subject that is close to his heart. When he was one of the international development ministers at Westminster, he helped me greatly in the move to make Strathaven one of Scotland's first Fairtrade towns, and I thank him for that. Since then, we have had the Fairtrade school movement. I get a buzz every time I think of Sandford school being the first Fairtrade school in the United Kingdom. We now have many Fairtrade schools. Young people are very important in taking the movement forward.</p><p>Members have mentioned too many schools for me to address them all in seven minutes, but I will mention three that I was fortunate enough to visit during Fairtrade fortnight. At Whitelees primary school in Cumbernauld, pupils made their own CD from start to finish&#8212;they wrote and performed the song, and they are now distributing it. Marvellous stuff. St Elizabeth's primary school in Hamilton managed an amazing fusion of Scottish Highland dancing and Caribbean music, which was a joy to behold.</p><p>I also thank Lianne, from Thornlie primary school in Wishaw. It takes an 11-year-old to go on the Lesley Riddoch show and give short shrift to the man from the Adam Smith Institute, which Mary Mulligan mentioned, when he was trying to say that fair trade is not a particularly valuable thing. Of course, it is. The fact that trade is fair does not mean that it is not free&#8212;the two are not mutually exclusive. Surely anyone with a social conscience or who cares about the world&#8212;as, I believe, the vast majority of people do&#8212;can help fair trade to move forward.<place-holder colnum=\"7127\"/></p><p>Although Fairtrade fortnight has passed, now is an apt time for members to discuss what events we attended. As Shirley-Anne Somerville, among others, said, there are people who keep the movement going throughout the year. It is no longer the case that we have to convince stores to stock Fairtrade products just for Fairtrade fortnight; people keep it going all year round. Indeed, even before it became popular, there were people plugging away in the churches, especially through Traidcraft, for many years. It is those folk who have kept the movement going and who have enabled Fairtrade fortnight now to be the focus for moving on for the next year.</p><p>As Iain Gray said, the Fairtrade mark can now be found on 3,000-plus products. We have also heard about the Fairtrade Foundation and the fact that the fair trade market in the UK is now worth &#163;500 million. Indeed, it is estimated that 90 per cent of people now recognise the Fairtrade mark on products. Since 2005, the number of African producer organisations that sell to the UK market has almost doubled, to 152. Each of those organisations represents thousands of farmers and workers.</p><p>Aileen Campbell mentioned the social premium. Fair trade is not just about the producers; it is also about the schools that are built and the co-ops that are formed in other countries to give a fair deal to workers. Of course, there is still a lot of work to be done.</p><p>The Scottish Government is absolutely committed to making Scotland one of the world's Fairtrade nations. To drive forward the campaign that the previous Administration started, the Scottish Fair Trade Forum receives from the international development fund core funding of &#163;60,000 per year for three years. In October last year, at the formal launch of the forum, I was delighted to announce further funding of up to &#163;40,000 for this financial year to assist it with more awareness-raising activities, a lot of which took place during Fairtrade fortnight. Real progress has been made since the forum elected its interim board&#8212;I hope to have the opportunity to meet its members soon&#8212;and I look forward to increased collaboration with the forum and its chair, John McAllion, with a view to building capacity.</p><p>I acknowledge that the Fairtrade nation criteria are ambitious, but Fairtrade nation status has to be meaningful. Becoming a Fairtrade nation cannot happen overnight. It is not about being first, or even one of the first; it is about taking on trade justice issues, looking at how procurement can be fairer within government and challenging preconceptions by looking at overseas examples. We are currently considering the findings of the select committee that Malcolm Chisholm mentioned.<place-holder colnum=\"7128\"/></p><p>I will conclude, although we could all say much more. We have achieved quite a lot, but the fight goes on. As James Kelly said, the battle continues, because this is a wide issue. I know that members of this Parliament and people all over Scotland will continue to support and promote fair trade, as they have done for many years, in Parliament, in the Government, in all our institutions and right across the country, to the benefit of people here and people overseas. Fair trade is all about ending the unfair poverty that producers in developing countries face.<place-holder time=\"17:47:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:47.</em></p>", "hdate": "2008-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401001", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fairtrade Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Patricia Ferguson for securing this debate on a very important subject.

I turned to my colleague Jamie Hepburn and said, \"Isn't this so depressing? This country has been at war for five years.\" I thank Aileen Campbell for bringing the debate to the Parliament and I thank all the members who have spoken. We have heard from members of the Labour Party, the SNP and the Conservatives, and I know that Patrick Harvie would have stayed if he could have done to speak on behalf of the Greens. Although we might not all agree on everything that has been said, one point that has come across clearly is the heartfelt conviction that everyone has that the war should be over and that the actions that took us into the war should be investigated properly. Aileen Campbell's debate is on a sombre topic and is, as she said, tinged by the sadness and personal loss of many individuals throughout the country.</p><p>Elaine Smith referred to the first debate in the Parliament on Iraq, with speeches from John McAllion and many others. It was clear from that debate that the Parliament felt that, no matter what powers are reserved from Scotland's Parliament and Government and held at Westminster, morality, humanity and common decency certainly are not and never can be reserved. In 2003, there was a big sense that people power could change the course of world events but, as I said, here we are five years later still debating an on-going conflict. At that time, we marched and said that the war was not in our name, but it was in our name that we were taken into an illegal war by the then Prime Minister. The conflict is in our name and it is the responsibility of each and every one of us&#8212;I know that many people in Scotland are deeply ashamed of that.</p><p>Many service personnel have died in those five years, including 18 Scots and four others from Scottish regiments. Each of those deaths is an individual tragedy. It is important and appropriate to note the contribution that our soldiers, sailors and flyers make to the preservation of our peace, as well as the contribution that Scots have made to peacekeeping and peacemaking throughout the world, often under the auspices of the United Nations. That should always be remembered. They have ended up in Iraq in an illegal war, which is a difficult situation for service personnel to be in. <place-holder colnum=\"7053\"/></p><p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of the conflict, there is absolutely no doubt that our servicemen and women deserve our support. Likewise, I am absolutely sure that every single member wishes the Iraqi people well. I know that every member will offer a hope that Iraqis can finally live in peace, control their country and be free to use their nation's obvious wealth&#8212;which many members have mentioned&#8212;to benefit their people.</p><p>In the 1950s, Dag Hammarskj&#246;ld and Ralph Bunche changed the United Nations into an active peace-seeking organisation and developed the principles of peacekeeping&#8212;disinterest, parity, permission and negotiation. We should all cherish that legacy and we should expect our political leaders to cherish it and to act on it on our behalf. Scotland believes fundamentally in peace and prosperity and in the rule of international law. We have heard this week about citizenship and that we should all swear oaths of allegiance to the country. People in this country and in England and Wales and the north of Ireland all show their patriotism in how they care for their countries and those about them. They want and deserve a Government in which they can trust. If people feel that the leader of that Government told lies to take them into an illegal conflict, it is a bit rich of those who were involved to demand that we show them that we care about our country. It would be far better if those who are in power showed the people whom they supposedly serve that they care about their country and the people in it.</p><p>Members have used previous debates in the Parliament to question the legality and morality of the conflict in Iraq and of wider international policy. Tonight, Bill Wilson gave a bit of a history of the so-called ethical foreign policy that has been perpetrated in our name for many years. Scotland's voice must be heard. There is anger that soldiers were sent into combat with equipment that appeared to be unfit for purpose, and concern that the troops are still on duty in Iraq. It is in that larger court of public opinion that morality and decency are judged, and each of us here has a say in that judgment.</p><p>I wish the people well who march on Saturday for peace. I hope that it is as big a march as previous ones. Sadly, five years down the line from when the war began, people are getting a bit dejected. They think, \"What's the point? Those who are in power and supposedly represent us, aren't doing so,\" and that turns to apathy. I urge as many people as possible to turn out at the march, to show clearly that it is still our opinion that this is a war that should never have been, that it is a war that should be stopped and that we need solutions to bring our Scottish troops home. Many other countries have pulled out of Iraq.<place-holder colnum=\"7054\"/></p><p>There was a lot of talk about hearts and minds when the war was entered into. What is in the hearts and minds of the people of Scotland is that we should not be in Iraq and that there should be proper reparation by those who took us into the war. What is in the hearts and minds of the people of Scotland is that we should support the Iraqi people for peace and prosperity in future&#8212;and that we need some truth.<place-holder time=\"17:46:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:46.</em></p>", "hdate": "2008-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400880", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Decision Time: Iraq War."}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At one point in the debate it suddenly hit me that, five years along the line, here we are yet again debating the war in Iraq.

However, I will pick up on some specific issues.</p><p>As always when we discuss Malawi and international development, I have been struck by the consensus in the Parliament about the way in which we are headed and about our moral obligation to and friendship with Malawi, which Karen Gillon talked about. Another issue that many members have spoken about is Malawi's potential. As we have heard, it is a beautiful country. Last week was a nice time of year to go there, with beautiful verdant scenery around us when we travelled, very like that in Scotland. I have seen Malawi looking very dry and different, but the beauty is there.</p><p>Aileen Campbell touched on a feature of Malawi that has huge potential but which has never been made the most of&#8212;the peace. It is a small African nation in a region of Africa that, sadly, suffers from a lot of turmoil. Within that, there is the oasis of Malawi, with friendship and peace. Individuals <place-holder colnum=\"6123\"/> going there from Scotland feel a sense of security. That has huge potential.</p><p>Alasdair Morgan talked about infrastructure and tourism. The capacity for tourism has not yet been truly tapped, but I hope that it will be. Through a programme that was started by Patricia Ferguson and continued by the present Government&#8212;despite our review, we have been meeting all the previous commitments&#8212;the Malawi Institute of Tourism has undergone capacity building. That is an economically sustainable developmental approach, which is important.</p><p>On commitments from the Scottish Executive, I assure Malcolm Chisholm that the &#163;4.5 million that was agreed previously has now been expended or allocated in this financial year. I will attend the European and External Relations Committee fairly soon to discuss such matters in more detail. One important point is that the money has been allocated with the agreement of the Malawian Government. It has always been crucial in the partnership that we have that it is for Malawians to decide what is best for them. We work in partnership and in discussion and come to joint agreement&#8212;it is not for us to impose anything.</p><p>I can confirm that, over the next two years, we have doubled the previous baseline budget of &#163;3 million a year for international development and that, in year 3 of the spending review period, the budget of &#163;4.5 million will be doubled to &#163;9 million. As many members have said, within that, a minimum of &#163;3 million is ring fenced for Malawi. That has given clarity about the funding for Malawi, which the Malawian Government has welcomed. The time was right to consider our agreement and to make changes as appropriate, which is what I wanted to do.</p><p>Karen Gillon summed up the matter well when she said that we have a partnership with Malawi. When I spoke to people in Malawi last week, I was keen to stress that we do not consider that we are aid donors to Malawi; instead, we are friends who are working together after a long history of shared interest. It is important that we do not set ourselves up as an aid donor to Malawi&#8212;the relationship is about friendship and partnership, not aid. We have often heard about the brain drain in all sorts of professions from countries such as Malawi. When we consider that, we must ask who is aiding who. We must be careful and specific in the language that we use.</p><p>Part of the added value from the partnership with Malawi and from the additional money that comes from Scotland to projects in Malawi can be about mobilising other partnerships.</p><p>For example, we funded a project last March with Opportunity International. The opportunity bank in Malawi is about microfinance and about <place-holder colnum=\"6124\"/> people being able, for the first time, to open bank accounts and gain the self-respect that can come from seeing their money rising. Our Government funding for that was matched by two different Scottish entrepreneurs, so the money was tripled right away. That then unlocked more than &#163;400 million from the European Union for the same project, so the small amount that went in from Scotland had great potential to open up much more funding.</p><p>On the issue of sustainability, we have the Scotland-Malawi business group. There is a board here in Scotland of respected Scottish businesspeople, and there is a board in Malawi of respected Malawian businesspeople. They are working together to ensure that young entrepreneurs have the mentorship that they require and can access loans that allow them to build up their businesses. That then allows them to sustain themselves, their immediate family and their extended family&#8212;and kinship is very important to people to Malawi; it sustains the way people live in the absence of any welfare state. Such sustainable ways of working are building the country up. Many people have spoken about added value and capacity building within the different professions. They are crucial.</p><p>Also important is the strong commitment that we see here, right across the chamber and right across civic society in Scotland. I agree with Jack McConnell and others about that.</p><p>Government cannot do everything and we should not pretend that we can. However, we can spearhead a message of friendship and partnership that can continue into the future.

I am just looking round the chamber to check that my MSP colleagues who were also in Malawi are fit and well and back at work. Yes they are. Good. We are all fine, and we all had a highly constructive visit.</p><p>I am pleased that we are having a subject debate on Malawi following my first ministerial trip there. The relationship between Scotland and Malawi transcends politics and is, because of the history of our two nations, supported by all MSPs and the whole of civic Scotland.</p><p>I had always been supportive of Scotland's partnership with Malawi and the agreement of the Parliament and the previous Scottish Executive to an international development budget, but when I took up the post of Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture last year, I was keen to take stock of progress on all our international development work&#8212;the time was right for me to do so. I also wanted to give everyone in Scotland who is involved in international development work the opportunity to comment on the Scottish Government's broad objectives in that area and, most important, on the mechanisms that we use for allocating funding.</p><p>We approached the process with careful thought and consideration because we must ensure that when we design an international development policy, we take on board a wide range of views and remain clear about our objectives. Most important of all, we must take on board the views of the Government and people of Malawi. I was determined not to rush the process, but instead to take time to ensure that we got it right. I wanted to draw on performance to date and to look forward to our future aspirations and priorities.</p><p>The refreshed international development policy will include a section specifically on Malawi and will confirm our commitment to continue to work closely with the Malawian Government in identifying future funding priorities.</p><p>As everyone knows, the programmes between Scotland and Malawi were originally set within the framework of the four strands of the co-operation agreement: health, education, civil society and governance, and sustainable economic development. Those four areas are still at the <place-holder colnum=\"6092\"/> forefront of our policy delivery, and many initiatives that fit into the co-operation agreement are still being undertaken and supported by the Scottish Government through the international development fund. We will continue to operate in those broad areas although during my visit I agreed with my counterparts in the Government of Malawi to develop a much stronger focus within those areas. I will say more about that later.</p><p>Members will be aware of the recent announcement of the remainder of this year's international development budget and will recognise that we have focused heavily on the strands that the Malawian Government felt were hugely important.</p><p>I awarded &#163;5,000 assistance to emergency relief for the flooding in the Chikwawa district and to address the severe health implications in the area. That assistance was match-funded by the University of Strathclyde and the Lord Provost of Glasgow. It is important to acknowledge the many organisations in Scotland that care about and contribute to Scotland's partnership with Malawi.</p><p>While in Malawi, I visited Bwalia Hospital and the University College of Nursing and College of Medicine. I was very pleased to see the work that is being done between Scotland and Malawi. Government and institutions are trying to build capacity there.</p><p>The same is true in education. We are now focusing resources on encouraging the development of the vocational education and skills training sector. In order to tackle that at source in Malawi, I recently announced funding of &#163;250,000 to Adam Smith College in Kirkcaldy to develop a programme of capacity building with the staff of every Government-funded further education college in Malawi, which will work with a group of about eight colleges in Scotland. I am pleased to say that progress is looking good.</p><p>I am very keen to ensure that everything that we do is joined up and that nothing is done in isolation. One example of that approach is the Chisomo Children's Club, which is a day centre for rescued street children. The club is not only about feeding children during the day and giving them some education&#8212;it is also about trying to re-integrate them into their families and villages and, where possible, helping them to complete their education. The club is now also funded to provide the children with vocational education and skills training to get them onto the path of employment so that they can work themselves out of poverty.</p><p>I also saw the work of Mary's Meals, which provides likhuni phala to children who receive one meal a day from local volunteers. That one meal a day ensures that many children do not starve, but it also encourages them to attend school, which <place-holder colnum=\"6093\"/> increases educational attainment. The other aspect of the project's work that is so important is that it works with communities. The whole community is involved in collecting, cooking and distributing the food or, as we saw, helping with the pre-school children. It is essential to get communities completely involved so that good work such as that is sustainable.</p><p>I turn to governance and civil society development, which is a strand that needs a good bit more work. I am not sure whether David Stewart is in the chamber, but he asked me the week before last about civic governance in Malawi and stressed its importance. I am delighted that we are funding a new relationship between the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Council for Non-Government Organisations in Malawi to strengthen its capacity to support the non-governmental organisation sector in Malawi. We had a very positive meeting with CONGOMA and Government representatives. I was very heartened to see the support that the Malawian Government is giving to the strengthening of civil society in Malawi. That is very important.</p><p>Institutional linking is also important. Government cannot do everything&#8212;this is not about Governments deciding what is best. Institutional linking between Scotland and Malawi is hugely important. One of our Deputy Presiding Officers, Alasdair Morgan, visited the Office of the Ombudsman in Malawi last week. Civil society development can gain from linking strong institutions in this country that have had&#8212;let us face it&#8212;many more years of democracy than Malawi has had. The benefit that can come from working together is hugely important.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13398460", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Despite newspaper reports to the contrary, I am fit and well and managed to do a lot of work in Malawi.

I also thank him hugely for a wonderful night in Fort William at the Scots trad music awards. I was privileged to attend in my role as minister&#8212;when I have gone along in the past, it has been off my own bat. I had missed the event for a couple of years and I was amazed at how big it has become. It is massive. Some 900 people had come to watch 130 musicians of world-class calibre.</p><p>We should not forget that world-class musicians play traditional music. Far too often, people try to pigeonhole traditional music as being not quite up there with other genres. Rob Gibson referred to our indigenous contemporary culture, part of the charm of which is that it is a living tradition&#8212;to borrow the title of Pete Heywood's magazine&#8212;which moves on and is contemporary. There is world-class, fabulous musicianship and we should celebrate traditional music more. Over the years, I have lost track of the number of people who said, after being taken to hear traditional music, \"I did not know it could be like that. How exciting! How wonderful! How great!\" Rob Gibson talked about Celtic Connections. It is astounding how that festival has grown over the years&#8212;this was its 15<sup>th</sup> year. He also talked about Phil Cunningham's series about Scotland's music, which was seen by 250,000 viewers, as did Malcolm Chisholm and others. It was wonderful, riveting television and it is a shame that it was not networked throughout the UK, as Jamie McGrigor said. We are potentially missing out on economic benefits&#8212;members talked about that, too. People all over the country, the continent and the world are fascinated by Scotland's indigenous music.</p><p>Cathy Peattie, who is an aficionado, used great language, as she always does, to talk about the celebration of our unique culture. As she rightly said, if we do not celebrate our culture, who will? Rob Gibson talked about the promotion of <place-holder colnum=\"5923\"/> Scotland overseas; we must also promote Scotland internally. Let us learn how to celebrate what we do that is truly unique and wonderful.</p><p>Cathy Peattie and Aileen Campbell mentioned Burns. Having announced a fairly small audit into the Scots language, I am raging at commentators who have accused me of trying to promote slang among our children.

Congratulations should go to Alex McLeish, his predecessor Walter Smith, all the players picked for the squads and all those at the Scottish Football Association who worked so hard to put in place the groundwork for success.</p><p>I turn now to the motion. Keith Brown quite rightly highlights the disappointment that was felt by many people that they were not able to watch all the qualifying matches on terrestrial television. I was interested in the examples given&#8212;particularly those given by Keith&#8212;of why people could not watch the matches. In some cases, there was no availability; in some cases, affordability was an issue; and in some cases, principle was an issue. Stuart McMillan spoke about disability issues, and Aileen Campbell raised an issue that I had not considered before. She said that young people are not always able to see matches because they do not have access to licensed premises. That is an extremely important point.</p><p>If Scotland or one of the other home nations had made it to the finals of the tournament, its matches in the finals would have been broadcast live on terrestrial television. Unfortunately, none of the teams qualified.</p><p>As we have heard, the regime for the coverage of sport on television and the designation of listed events is&#8212;as we all know&#8212;a responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. As Keith Brown explained, the effect of listing is to require full live terrestrial coverage of category A events, or the provision of terrestrial recorded highlights of category B events. As well as the world cup and European championship finals, category A events include the Scottish cup final, the Olympic games, the grand national and the Derby. Category B events include the six nations rugby tournament, the open golf championship and the Commonwealth games. As Jim Tolson pointed out, we should ensure in our discussions that sports other than football are considered.</p><p>The arrangements for listing are provided for in the Broadcasting Act 1996.

As we have heard, those quotas are regulated by Ofcom&#8212;I understand that members who represent the area have had a meeting with Ofcom&#8212;which would need to approve any action to change local news provision.

Of course, that can bring opportunities for new and varied means of communication. We all know that digital switch-over will begin in the Borders in November 2008.

It is responsible to question and, if appropriate, to disagree.</p><p>I will consider the treaty's development. The European Council of December 2001 decided that fundamental reforms of the EU decision-making process were required. The convention on the future of Europe was established, with the aim of allowing a range of opinion on the new draft constitution. In a relatively rare moment in the history of European integration, the people of France and the Netherlands gave their political <place-holder colnum=\"4567\"/> leaders a reality check when they voiced their opinions directly, through referenda. Our people are similarly entitled to voice their opinions.</p><p>The German presidency broke the deadlock that followed the referenda with an outline agreement at the European Council in June this year. It handed the task of finalising the details to an intergovernmental conference under the Portuguese presidency. The task was completed for agreement of a final text at the October European Council. Heads of member state Governments assembled in Lisbon on 13 December to sign the treaty. Prime Minister Gordon Brown arrived to sign on behalf of the UK later&#8212;I assume that he wanted to sign as surreptitiously as possible, but sign he did. The treaty has finally been agreed and signed even by Gordon Brown, who had previously called for a referendum. The 27 member states must now carry out their processes of ratification. Only Ireland is certain to have a referendum, but we will continue to press for one in the UK: SNP members at Westminster will actively press for a referendum as the UK ratification process continues.</p><p>On the substance of the treaty, many provisions are helpful and positive. For example, the treaty provides for a mechanism whereby parliaments of member states will have the opportunity to be consulted on possible new proposals for legislation, in relation to subsidiarity. The treaty also for the first time gives parliaments a direct role in the EU decision-making process. Connecting to citizens through parliaments is an important step in ensuring the EU's continued credibility.</p><p>Of course, the Scottish Parliament is not a parliament of an EU member state, although the Government's ambition is that it should become one. Until that point, we must ensure that this Parliament plays a full and effective role in working with the Westminster Parliament to discharge its responsibilities.</p><p>General areas of improvement include the enhanced role of the European Parliament in decision making, which we welcome as a step towards improved democratic accountability of the EU. I have great respect for Scotland's members of the European Parliament from all four parties. In working tirelessly for Scotland's interests, they listen to the views of many individuals and organisations and often collaborate well across party lines. Enhancing their role is a further positive and pro-democratic step.</p><p>However, there are negative aspects of the treaty&#8212;an area of continuing concern is fisheries. For the past few days, Richard Lochhead has worked flat out in Brussels, trying to get the most effective deal for Scotland's fishing industry. He did so in full knowledge of the limitations of <place-holder colnum=\"4568\"/> Scotland not being a member state and, of course, of the absurdity of aspects of the current common fisheries policy. I want to make it absolutely clear that the Scottish Government cannot accept the European Union's claim of exclusive competence over</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy\",</p><p>as the treaty now states explicitly and for the first time. I said that in a previous debate on the subject in the chamber.</p><p>Of course, the Scottish Government is not alone in its concerns on the treaty. Michael Connarty, the highly respected chairman of the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee, has highlighted a number of issues of concern.

I would also like to thank those who have contributed to the debate, during which there was not a lot of disagreement.</p><p>Bill Aitken talked about an essential element of democracy that we all recognise: the need for government and judiciary to have a clear separation of powers. Hugh O'Donnell and Sandra White talked about the history of the Indian subcontinent and the turbulence that it has experienced over the centuries. Finally, Alasdair Allan brought us up to date by talking about the current regime and the turbulence that still exists. All members picked up on the revulsion that is felt in this chamber, in this country and beyond at the <place-holder colnum=\"4542\"/> events that we witness on our television screens and read about in our newspapers.</p><p>As Margaret Curran said, the Government and the Parliament support the Pakistani community in Scotland regardless of who forms the Government. That is something precious about our country; we support the community's concerns about the imposition of the state of emergency in Pakistan, and the suspension of the constitution. It is difficult for us, who have the privilege of living in a generally peaceful place, to understand the awful helplessness that people who have moved here, and second and third-generation members of the community who were born here, feel when they watch such terrible events unfold. Although they now call Scotland their home&#8212;and it is&#8212;they still love and care about the place with which they have a shared history, and the people who live there.</p><p>Many members of the Pakistani community in Scotland still have close connections with Pakistan and have family there. The situation is very difficult for them, as they are terrified about what is happening to people who are not just part of them, but members of their family for whom they have a deep love. That is an on-going, precious feature of the Pakistani community. Margaret Curran spoke about the work that leading representatives of the community, including Bashir Ahmad and Mohammad Sarwar, have been doing for years.</p><p>This year, we have been celebrating the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of Pakistan as a sovereign state. It is particularly regrettable that, at what should have been a happy anniversary time, a state of emergency has been imposed on the people of Pakistan. As well as the state of emergency, there is a new provisional constitutional order, a key feature of which is the suspension of constitutional articles guaranteeing security of the person; safeguards on arrest and detention; freedom of movement, assembly, association and speech; and equality of citizens. Another was the removal of the Supreme Court's authority to issue any order against, or to challenge in any way, the president, the prime minister or any person exercising powers or jurisdiction under their authority.</p><p>Alasdair Allan referred to President Musharraf's actions. Separate ordinances have been issued to tighten up regulations for print and electronic media, forbidding them from criticising the head of state, military or judiciary. Those are fundamental rights that all democratic Governments should safeguard for their citizens. The Pakistan Government has robbed its citizens of those rights.</p><p>The international community condemned the imposition of the state of emergency and requested that President Musharraf resign as <place-holder colnum=\"4543\"/> head of the Pakistan army. It said that media restrictions should be lifted, that political prisoners should be released, that basic constitutional order should be restored and that free and fair elections should take place.</p><p>We have heard from Mr Ahmad and others that, when the Commonwealth ministerial action group met to discuss the situation, Pakistan ended up being suspended from the Commonwealth. The reason for that suspension was the Government of Pakistan's failure to implement the series of measures that the Commonwealth ministerial action group had requested. On 3 November, President Musharraf abrogated completely Pakistan's constitution.</p><p>Some members think that what we call the west has been rather light in its criticism of the regime. Following his statement of 3 November, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs made a statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday 7 November, in which he condemned the Pakistan Government's decision to impose a state of emergency and to suspend the constitution. He advised that he had spoken to the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Pakistan and to Opposition leaders, and that he had requested that the restrictions on the people of Pakistan be lifted. He also advised that he had spoken to the British high commission in Islamabad, to get a wider understanding of the situation.<place-holder colnum=\"4544\"/></p><p>We have heard that the situation in Pakistan seems to be changing and that the state of emergency is likely to be lifted this weekend. That has not happened yet, but we all hope that it will.</p><p>The Pakistan Government has announced that elections will take place on 8 January 2008. On the surface, we welcome that. The people of Pakistan have a democratic right to take part in full and fair elections, but we have heard understandable concerns today, and previously, about whether those elections will be free and fair.</p><p>We need Pakistan to move forward towards democracy and the rule of law, and to build on the work that has been done over the years. For more than half its existence, it has been under military rule. There is a unanimous view from the international community that democracy, human rights, political freedoms and constitutional rule are absolutely necessary for the security and future stability of Pakistan.</p><p>I can say to Mr Ahmad that I am at one with his concerns. We will ensure that the strong feelings that have been expressed in the debate will be relayed without delay to the Foreign Secretary at Westminster.<place-holder time=\"18:20:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 18:20.</em></p>", "hdate": "2007-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow's Pakistani Community"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to thank Bashir Ahmad for bringing this motion to the Parliament.

I am sure that all members agree. One of the first events that I was privileged to attend as a minister was the our Scotland event at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, which I understand was funded by the previous Administration and the City of Edinburgh Council. I opened that marvellous event, which showcased Scotland's many cultures. Tomorrow, the First Minister will attend the closing event.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm and Bill Kidd spoke about the need to spread the message among the members of the diaspora.

We would fight against that all the way. There is <place-holder colnum=\"4003\"/> absolutely no definition of culture. We cannot put on culture the straitjacket of a definition, because that would not allow culture to flourish. As the minister responsible for culture, I have said all along that we must allow culture to flourish. We should not cram it into pigeonholes for the sake of ticking boxes. We have absolutely no desire to control Scotland's artists, musicians, dancers and actors, or to examine the narrow issue of \"cultural entitlement\". Let the arts flourish.</p><p>Concerns have been expressed about this Government using the term \"fairness\" rather than \"social justice\". I cannot see what the difference is. We should be promoting fairness in absolutely everything that we do as a Government, we intend to do so. If things are fair, we achieve social justice.

And, in the interests of equality, I have to say that I was surprised and disappointed that Ted did not make a case for St Margaret, who also has a link to Fife.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank also spoke of the importance of promoting the concept of the national holiday, which I agree is important. There were interesting links to Gavin Brown's speech. Promoting the idea in our schools and building up momentum will make the celebration of our national day become a desire and a template for a holiday. Yes, we have to build on everything that is being done, and that is the Government's intention. We very much have an eye on the year of homecoming in 2009. As Gavin Brown said, that is important.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank and Murdo Fraser spoke about the religious significance of St Andrew's day. I spoke to Cardinal Keith O'Brien last night and I learned that St Mary's cathedral&#8212;which holds relics of St Andrew&#8212;has a special St Andrew's day mass, which John Swinney will attend to say a few words. My colleague Maureen Watt tells me that last Sunday, to celebrate St Andrew's day, she read the lessons in Doric in the kirk of St Nicholas in Aberdeen, which is great.</p><p>There has been a lot of talk about the winter festival, but there is so much more to it than people think. We have to get that across. I am delighted that people are already coming to us and <place-holder colnum=\"4004\"/> asking whether they can be part of the winter festival. For example, we are going to have the first Gaelic Christmas concert in Glasgow, at St Andrew's in the square, which will be headed by Fiona Mackenzie, and the organisers have requested that the concert be part of the winter festival. Karen Whitefield mentioned hogmanay, and we also have Celtic Connections and Burns night. The Highland new year in the middle of January, up in Inverness, is also part of the winter festival, as is Shetland's Up-Helly-Aa. The difference is that we are trying very hard to unify everything under the winter festival theme. As Margo MacDonald said, we can build that up, and use this year as a springboard, which is absolutely what we intend to do.</p><p>Sandra White was disappointed at the negativity that some members have shown. I am too, but I hope that we can all get over that negativity and celebrate our national day together. The Labour group made contributions about the previously proposed potential for a new year's day holiday.

As a member of the Parliament in the previous session, I was happy to support the overwhelming groundswell of public opinion in favour of a ban on shopping and trading on Christmas day, which is a day for families to be together.

Obviously, he thought about the substantive issues and has made a considered contribution to the debate.</p><p>St Andrew's day is Scotland's national day. In our manifesto and the 100-days document, we set out our commitment to mobilise Scotland's national day for the benefit of our economy and country, and to give a boost to our traditional and contemporary culture. Our aim is to raise awareness of the day as a cornerstone of Scotland's winter festival, building on our success in attracting visitors to join us for hogmanay. We also want to build on the global reputation of Scotland's national bard, the excellence of our summer festivals and our incredible scenery.</p><p>We want to ensure that Scotland is seen as a year-round destination that is open for business and ready to engage with the world. The St Andrew's day programme involves events around the world and in all Scotland's cities&#8212;modern and ancient&#8212;and serves as a launch pad for <place-holder colnum=\"3968\"/> Scotland's winter festivals. Throughout the country, top visitor attractions are opening their doors for free, in celebration of our national day.</p><p>Scotland's pre-schools, schools and universities are being encouraged to join the St Andrew's day celebrations. Some are hosting events and others have themed their activities on the day around the many cultures that make up Scotland's people. We are creating new events such as the St Andrew's day debate and we are working with new partners such as Edinburgh Leisure, Dance Base and the Scottish Storytelling Centre.</p><p>The Government is spending &#163;400,000 on St Andrew's day and a further &#163;300,000 on the winter festival, giving sponsorship to Scotland's cities for their winter festival events. We are galvanising activity all across Scotland, sponsoring events in Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness, Glasgow, Stirling and elsewhere and delivering the St Andrew's day celebrations in Edinburgh.</p><p>We know of 60 schools events and 13 events in further and higher education institutions. For example, Banff and Buchan College is providing a free porridge breakfast for staff and students, and 87 second-year pupils from Waid academy in Fife are taking part in a sponsored walk along the old pilgrim route from Guardbridge to St Andrews cathedral to raise money for the Children's Hospice Association Scotland.</p><p>We are raising the profile of St Andrew's day and Scotland internationally as well as at home. A new section of the www.scotland.org website, entitled celebrate Scotland, will provide a permanent on-line resource for the promotion of Scottish culture and festivals. The St Andrew's day section, which is live and promoting activity in Scotland and overseas on and around the national day, will build into a sustainable, international resource for the winter festivals.</p><p>We are selling Scotland abroad. Tomorrow, we will launch a new website in Chinese&#8212;www.scotland.cn&#8212;which will be followed up with direct mail to appropriate Scottish stakeholders and Chinese media contacts. By celebrating St Andrew's day overseas and utilising Scotland's reputation, icons and traditions, we can reinforce Scotland's culture and place in today's world.</p><p>The Scottish diaspora are proactive and very proud to celebrate their home country's national day. To date, we are aware of more than 100 St Andrew's day events around the world, and we are still counting.</p><p>We are also doing more here. I hope that some members have already downloaded the Red Hot Chilli Pipers ringtone from the website. I am not technically minded enough to be able to do that, so I would be grateful if somehow could show me.<place-holder colnum=\"3969\"/></p><p>Our national conversation is up and running, and the public are engaging in their thousands to argue for and against constitutional change. The debate has shown how every aspect of life in Scotland has somehow been constrained by the current devolution settlement and, between this St Andrew's day and the next, the Scottish Government will make the case for constitutional change. I urge everyone who lives and works in Scotland and those throughout the world who have an interest in the country to join in that national conversation.</p><p>Scotland has been shaped by the ebb and flow of migrants over centuries and the richness of our culture and tradition, our architecture and music, our art and education are testament to those influences. That diverse population helps Scotland to experience different ideas and values and helps to develop a culture of entrepreneurship and ambition.</p><p>Scotland is growing in confidence, and becoming more dynamic, forward thinking and energetic. Of course, there are challenges that can shackle opportunities and our nation's potential. Yes, there are pockets of prejudice, bigotry, racism and discrimination. We will continue with a wide programme of work on those issues, and further develop the one Scotland campaign and the national statement and action plan on race equality. Moreover, following the announcement of the outcome of the spending review, we are considering the future funding of work and other projects that tackle racism and promote race equality, integration and community cohesion.</p><p>St Andrew's day is Scotland's national day. It is the national day both for everyone who lives here and for anyone who wishes to visit us tomorrow. It is time for us to celebrate everything that is good about Scotland and challenge what needs to be challenged.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I trust that you are pleased that I have given you some extra time. I move,</p><p>That the Parliament believes in the importance of celebrating Scotland's national day; recognises the opportunity that it offers to both celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the 21st century and to promote a fair and inclusive society; notes the Scottish Government's proactive support of a programme of events throughout the country and all of Scotland's six cities; commends the work of schools and community groups across Scotland in teaching our young people about St Andrew's Day and promoting diversity through their celebrations, and furthermore thanks the St Andrew's societies, Caledonian societies, Scottish Development International, Globalscots, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and all the other overseas organisations who have planned over 100 wide-ranging celebrations in countries around the world.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393421", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew's Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is absolutely nothing to stop any Scottish political party handing out the saltire to Scots people.

There is still time for the UK Government to push for that wording to be changed. Unless or until it is changed, the Scottish Government will continue to believe that it is not in Scotland's best interests and will ask the UK Government to fulfil its own manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on a treaty that Michael Connarty&#8212;a member of the Government party and the chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee at Westminster&#8212;says has not changed substantively from the constitutional treaty. It is entirely disingenuous for some members to suggest that those who wish a referendum to be held on the reform treaty are anti-Europe and want to come out of the European Union. That is ridiculous.</p><p>I turn to our changing priorities on Europe. There has been talk about how 21 priorities is too many and how that is three fewer priorities than the previous Administration had. Like the previous Administration, we consider what comes out of <place-holder colnum=\"3284\"/> Europe that is of importance to Scotland. That is how we will define our priorities. The previous Administration had 24 priorities, three of which are now complete, and we have picked up on the others. That is right; most members have Scotland's interests at heart, although we have different political means of meeting that objective.</p><p>We will formally revise the priorities table every six months. However, I realise that EU issues can often become hot political topics almost overnight and I intend to be flexible with our list of priority issues. Should an EU issue suddenly arise that a stakeholder considers merits immediate attention, I will consider adding it to our table immediately. The aim of our European engagement will always be to protect Scottish interests, and I consider the table of priorities as one tool with which to achieve that aim. Indeed, Kenny MacAskill, my other ministerial colleagues and I have identified a further issue that has arisen since we initially agreed the list in August. We have agreed to add to the list the framework decision on the recognition and supervision of suspended sentences and alternative sanctions, which is being discussed at working group level in the European Council.</p><p>The framework decision seeks to establish a system by which member states would recognise arrangements for post-custodial statutory supervision and certain non-custodial sentences that were made in one another's jurisdictions. In situations in which an offender was sentenced in an EU country other than his normal state of residence, that would allow him or her to return home and have the sentenced supervised by the home authorities.</p><p>We support the general aims of the framework decision, largely because it makes successful rehabilitation more likely and can allow for better public protection. Therefore, it is important that we work closely with the UK Government to ensure that our concerns are taken into account in all the negotiations, which can have significant implications for the Scottish justice system. We will devote significant time and effort to achieving that in the coming months. Hence the framework decision's inclusion in our list of EU priorities.</p><p>I hope that members will take that inclusion in the spirit in which it is intended: we are willing to listen to concerns about European legislation and to consider others' priorities. However, I say to Helen Eadie that she should not be under any illusion that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing is not speaking to anyone in Europe. She is discussing with many small independent countries and other regions in Europe how best we can defend our health service. Helen Eadie must have a basic understanding of how the <place-holder colnum=\"3285\"/> system works before she comes to the Parliament and starts saying terrible things.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391560", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Union Priorities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have worked closely with the UK Government to protect Scottish interests as the negotiations have progressed but, unfortunately, it has not pressed our case for the amendment of the wording on exclusive competence on the conservation of marine biological resources.

I shall ask for members' views at our meeting this evening.</p><p>Each of the priorities relates to one or more of the Scottish Government's overall objectives, and I hope that the outcome of each will contribute to those objectives. For example, we have prioritised the European structural funds programmes in support of a wealthier and fairer Scotland. As I said in response to Jeremy Purvis's question, Scotland has fewer resources from those funds <place-holder colnum=\"3243\"/> than it has had in previous years, largely reflecting the fact that the enlarged European Union has many new areas in need of significant economic growth. We will continue to work to ensure that those funds are channelled appropriately and effectively into supporting projects in communities that will benefit economically from them.</p><p>We are working to deliver a greener Scotland, and we have identified several EU issues as important in that regard. One that I will single out, partly because it does not always receive much attention, is the soil thematic strategy. Scotland has an extremely good record on soil protection that we are keen to continue and develop. We have carried out a formal three-month consultation on the implications of the proposed soil framework directive in Scotland. Ultimately, we need to ensure that the Scottish position is incorporated into negotiations, as Scotland's soils are different from those in the rest of the United Kingdom&#8212;they contain large amounts of carbon.</p><p>The EU proposal for the exchange of information on criminal records should also assist our objective of a safer and stronger Scotland. We welcome that proposal, as information on the criminal behaviour of citizens from other member states who live and work in Scotland will assist Scottish police forces in their efforts to prevent or detect crime.

I was thrilled by \"The Bacchae\" and \"Black Watch\" and I was mesmerised by the wonderful music of the Venezuelan Youth Orchestra.</p><p>Scotland's international reputation knows no bounds. This year's Edinburgh festivals were some of the most successful ever. Performers and visitors came from every corner of the globe to celebrate art and creativity.</p><p>I also applaud the national collections. This summer saw the opening of the John Murray archive, the tour of the \"Fonn 's Duthchas: Land and Legacy\" exhibition, and the Warhol and naked portrait exhibitions, to name but a few. The National Library of Scotland's \"Tea and Tigers: Stories from Scotland and South Asia\" exhibition and the National Museums of Scotland's \"Picasso: Fired with Passion\" exhibition were also resounding successes.</p><p>Our national performing companies are achieving the highest standards in performance and outreach work. Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet are to appear in the newly refurbished Eden Court. Internationally, the National Theatre of Scotland, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra are all touring with support from the Government's international fund.</p><p>It is with those successes in mind that I offer the Government's plans for culture. My vision for culture has three themes: first, our national cultural identity; secondly, celebrating Scotland's creative sector and its practitioners; and thirdly, our cultural policy, which is for everyone in Scotland.</p><p>First, with the national conversation under way, it is apt that we talk about culture&#8212;the beating heart of our nation. Culture is a part of the way that we understand and project ourselves and Scotland's place in the world. We have a reputation for unique, accessible and high-quality culture that embraces the traditional and the contemporary. Scotland's rich heritage and vibrant cultural life play a huge part in making Scotland a <place-holder colnum=\"3073\"/> great place in which to live, work and invest, and to visit.</p><p>As part of that, we are committed to developing and promoting Gaelic culture and language, which contribute to making us a unique nation. We want to expand Gaelic-medium education and we will ensure implementation of B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig's national plan for Gaelic. Our St Andrew's day programme celebrates our national pride and our winter festival programme showcases our excellent, world-class creativity. However, it does not stop there. We plan to support and promote Scotland-based artists by making available an annual Edinburgh festivals expo fund that will help with the costs of new productions, events and exhibitions that are premiered at the Edinburgh festivals.</p><p>The second theme is the creative sector and its practitioners. When we talk about cultural policy, it is sometimes too easy to get lost in debates about structures, funding and process. Let us not forget the core of what we are about&#8212;art for art's sake, before everything else. What is important, and what the Government will strive to do, is to acknowledge, recognise and celebrate creative Scots. Our artists include musicians such as KT Tunstall, performers, sculptors such as Sandy Stoddart, writers, and filmmakers and theatre directors such as David Mackenzie and Mark Thomson&#8212;the list goes on.</p><p>We will celebrate creative practitioners, giving shape to a community of people who best represent the elite of Scotland's creative and cultural achievements. Edwin Morgan, Scotland's national poet, has already agreed to be the founding member of that community.</p><p>Let me set out our plans to support a culturally vibrant and creatively confident Scotland. In September, the First Minister announced that we intend to introduce a bill to establish a new body called creative Scotland. I now offer the Parliament some more details. I have considered the views that were expressed in the consultation on the previous Administration's draft culture (Scotland) bill. We have decided to continue with the plan to establish creative Scotland, but we propose some changes, which I will outline. Apart from that, we will keep new legislation to a minimum.</p><p>Creative Scotland will support artists and creative practitioners. It will build on the successes of the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen and will inherit their resources and staff. Those two organisations have achieved great things. People in the arts, film and the wider screen and creative industries in Scotland have benefited greatly from their efforts. I pay tribute to them and the folk who work for them.<place-holder colnum=\"3074\"/></p><p>Creative Scotland will identify, support and develop talent and excellence. It will support hubs of cultural and creative excellence that will have local reach. It will have the freedom to support any form of creative expression and it will continue to provide strong support for film and the wider screen industries, which it will do through its grants, loans and investments. It will have a licence from the Government to take risks, to stimulate controversy and to challenge accepted thinking. Much of what it supports will go on to become great achievements. Its efforts will inspire and support a culturally cosmopolitan Scotland&#8212;one that attracts and retains increasing numbers of talented people.</p><p>Creative Scotland will also promote understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of the arts and culture. In particular, the Government will look to it to widen access and participation. We will ask creative Scotland to play a leading role as a catalyst for Scotland's arts and creative sector. Creative Scotland will lead good practice on stimulating and engaging audiences. It will promote cultural diversity and build further the contribution of voluntary and community arts, and also business sponsorship.</p><p>Creative Scotland will work in close concert with a range of expert and interested bodies and sectors, including B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig; the national collections; the national performing companies; national advisory and membership bodies such as the Scottish Library and Information Council and the Scottish Museums Council; the further and higher education sectors; and the voluntary sector, all of which perform important functions. We will look to creative Scotland to work in close partnership with them and local authorities. I will develop that point later. Creative Scotland's role&#8212;to lead our vision for creativity&#8212;will not diminish the authority or value of any other body, but we will ask all partners to co-operate in developing common approaches to common challenges.</p><p>Having listened to views that were expressed in the consultation on the ministerial power of direction, I announce today that, when we introduce the culture bill to Parliament early next year, it will be amended from the version that was published last year, to ensure that creative Scotland has complete autonomy when providing support&#8212;including financial support&#8212;and encouragement to those working in the creative sector.</p><p>In making the proposal, I acknowledge that the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen have always enjoyed operational independence. My predecessor as culture minister made that point, and it is a fair one. However, the principle of artistic independence is sufficiently important to enshrine it in legislation, therefore the bill will <place-holder colnum=\"3075\"/> include a guarantee that no minister may interfere in the artistic judgment of the body in its support of the creative community.</p><p>I hope that creative Scotland and its role in supporting talent and promoting participation will be welcomed. Those are traditional and valuable aims, but creative Scotland will go further. It will have a new role to champion the potential of creativity throughout Scotland. It will break through into every part of our national life and help to realise all the benefits of the arts, culture and creativity.</p><p>Ample evidence is available today that highlights the role that cultural activity can play in restoring physical and mental health, in encouraging positive behaviour among young people, and in building community pride. We recognise the impact of culture and creativity across education and in the myriad other ways that colleagues will know of from their own experience.</p><p>I emphasise that the Government's creative Scotland bill will ask the new body to give due weight to all the benefits that arts and culture can bring. A number of consultees were concerned that the previous draft culture (Scotland) bill required creative Scotland to look particularly towards economic benefit. I agree with those anxieties, and we will change the new bill to reflect that.</p><p>I hope that the Parliament will agree that our plans for creative Scotland offer an exciting and ambitious prospect for new creative achievements. The Government is fortunate that the enterprise is being led by Dr Richard Holloway and the joint board of the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen. They have been thinking imaginatively about what is proposed for creative Scotland, and I expect that they will have many new ideas on how it should work, where it should be based and how it can be successful.</p><p>I now turn to the remainder of the previous draft culture (Scotland) bill. I thank those who took part in the consultation on it. The draft bill proposed to reform the governance of our national cultural collections. There is merit in keeping the legislation up to date with modern practice, but I prefer first to assess how the present structures work.</p><p>The draft bill included proposals to give local authorities a power to broadcast information. I can see an argument for adding to the powers of local authorities, but there is already scope for local television to be licensed by the Office of Communications&#8212;Ofcom&#8212;so, at the moment, we do not see that as a priority.</p><p>Likewise, I do not propose to change legislation on local museums and libraries. Although it is old, I am content that it still provides for a strong local <place-holder colnum=\"3076\"/> service. I do not propose to legislate now to extend the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Act 2003 to Scotland. The Government is sympathetic to the purposes of that legislation, but I am aware that the United Kingdom Government is considering improvements, and it would be prudent to take account of that work. Should a suitable opportunity arise in our legislative programme, we will consider progressing that.</p><p>The third theme of my cultural policy concerns everyone in Scotland, because I believe that it is important that everyone should be able to feel part of Scotland's cultural life. That is why widening access to and participation in culture is a priority for the Government.</p><p>I have read and thought about people's responses to the proposals on local cultural provision in the draft culture (Scotland) bill. I have also detected a good level of consensus about the best ways to encourage more people, from all ages and backgrounds, to become involved in the arts and their living heritage. That is heartening, especially because of the amazing difference that coming into contact with culture can make to people's lives.</p><p>I decided early that to deliver my cultural policy I needed a practical approach that was based on experience and consensus and which would therefore have the best chance of success. I seek success through outcomes that make a positive and lasting difference.</p><p>One option was to use legislation, but I could not see how that would sit comfortably with what I and my colleague John Swinney seek to achieve through reform of the public sector. Our reform agenda requires a more mature relationship between central Government and local government that is based on outcome agreements and trust, to promote a strong, fair and inclusive national identity.</p><p>Our goal is to inspire greater commitment to providing high-quality cultural opportunities that are developed through community engagement. That is not best achieved by using the law to require local authorities to undertake new planning and reporting processes. The way to inspire commitment to a jointly held ambition is to work together. That is what I plan to do. I am pleased that that approach has the enthusiastic backing of Councillor Harry McGuigan and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</p><p>Our national cultural bodies are part of our drive to widen cultural access. Richard Holloway has made a helpful start by visiting local authorities to discuss aspirations for the national-local relationship. Just as national and local providers of culture should work together to enhance cultural access, I expect local authorities to collaborate <place-holder colnum=\"3077\"/> with the voluntary, community and independent sector bodies in their areas to deliver new opportunities.</p><p>There must be a focus in the new partnership on developing our understanding of the barriers to accessing culture and on taking steps to overcome them. There are places where we can start. Step 1 is about community planning partnerships getting involved in culture. Planning for culture should be everyone's business, with community empowerment at its heart. We will provide community planners with new advice and encouragement to help all sectors to play their part in cultural delivery, while adding value to other service plans through cultural activity.</p><p>Step 2 is about sharing knowledge of the impacts of culture, so that other sectors and community planners get the message that culture delivers what it promises for quality of life&#8212;including creativity, well-being and fun. To do that, we shall, with our local government partners and with national bodies, further develop and publicise information about the difference that culture makes.</p><p>Step 3 is about providers striving to deliver high-quality cultural provision. Just as all aspects of the national performing companies' activities are now subject to peer review, local provision should also be subject to assessment. We are working with local authorities and cultural bodies to develop a quality assurance framework under which local authorities can assess their standards of local consultation, planning and delivery. That will embrace sector models such as the well-regarded public library quality improvement matrix.</p><p>Step 4 is about learning more successful ways to engage with potential participants and audiences from a range of backgrounds and to plan cultural delivery with their aspirations very much in mind. I am supporting 13 innovative projects throughout Scotland that are helping to find ways of overcoming some barriers to participation. They are working with communities and individuals who tend not to take part and they are forging links with community planning. For example, in Fife we are seeing genuine grass-roots engagement as citizens and professionals work together to determine the shape and scope of Fife's future cultural provision. The Dundee project has shown that social exclusion needs to be tackled proactively, so that all of society can enjoy the world of culture.</p><p>The feedback that is emerging from those projects and others shows that we need new models of service provision that are based on local accountability and dialogue. Those projects will be our culture champions. What we learn from them about people-centred approaches will help to inform future policy.<place-holder colnum=\"3078\"/></p><p>Presiding Officer, I think that you and members will agree that the Government's commitment to our nation's cultural scene is aspirational and practical in its content, and that we have an exciting and inspiring time ahead for the benefit of Scotland's people.

The Scottish Arts Council is exploring how to maximise the value to community life of public art works, which are a tangible expression of identity and belonging. Scotland's urban places are remarkable, too. They are cityscapes with their own beauty, grandeur and world-renowned centres of creativity.

Much of the legislation that the Scottish Parliament deals with starts in Brussels, and decisions that are made at the European level affect the lives of everyone who lives in Scotland.</p><p>Members who were at yesterday's European and External Relations Committee meeting know first hand the variety and detail of this Government's EU priorities. Those priorities and our engagement with the EU in general reflect the fact that it yields great economic, social and cultural benefit to the people of Scotland. The international co-operation that it affords means that many of our priorities on the environment, the economy and energy will be delivered in partnership with it and its member states.</p><p>However, anyone who followed the discussion at the committee yesterday will also know how difficult and divisive any treaty reform can be. Therefore, it is entirely right that the Parliament should consider and form views on the structure and processes of the European Union. Although we may not always like every outcome of the EU's activities, this Government will be a reliable, consistent and competent partner on the European stage. Members will be aware that the First Minister and I visited Brussels in the first 100 days of this Government to start building the contacts that will allow us to raise Scotland's voice in Europe.</p><p>I will mention some facts about the draft EU reform treaty. First, the timescales and process <place-holder colnum=\"1853\"/> that emerged from the European Council in June were clear but demanding. The intergovernmental conference has been tasked with producing a text for agreement in mid-October, with formal sign-off at the European Council in December. The mandate to which the IGC is working means that much of what will be in the reform treaty text that emerges is already decided. Equally important, much is still up for grabs. I would not take seriously the claims of anyone who thinks that they can predict how all the discussions will go, but it is right that this Government is clear about what it can and cannot accept.</p><p>It is worth saying what is good about the treaty that is likely to emerge. Negotiating a document among 27 partners with a wide range of interests will never be easy going, but the treaty is an important contribution&#8212;indeed, it is the only one on the table&#8212;to helping an enlarged EU do some of its business better. We should all welcome steps towards improving the efficiency and transparency of the governance of the EU.</p><p>Some members are, of course, sceptical of the European Union. I am sure that they will welcome the clarity that the reform treaty brings to the voluntary nature of membership of the EU. It seems likely that the treaty will include a provision that asserts the right of any member state to withdraw from the union. There is no irrevocable transfer of powers to the union.</p><p>At the European and External Relations Committee yesterday, Margo MacDonald asked about passerelle clauses, and I will answer her question now. Some passerelle clauses exist in the current treaties. New ones in the reform treaty would extend the use of procedures that allow decisions that currently require unanimity to be taken by majority voting. Some people have raised concerns about those clauses, which would allow simplified treaty revision without an intergovernmental conference&#8212;I understand that those provisions are what Ms MacDonald referred to yesterday as \"the ratchet clause\". I understand those concerns, but the fact that any such change requires the agreement of all the member states and that, in the most significant cases, a single national Parliament is allowed to block such a move means that there is comfort that such flexibility will not be misused. That in-built veto on the loss of a veto is a decision that the UK should accept but, of course, I would be more comfortable if we, like many small independent countries, were at the top table considering directly whether that was the correct thing to do.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13387773", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Treaty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. The devolution settlement demands that the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament be closely involved in a huge range of European issues.

The US is important for trade, investment and tourism and the country sends more overseas students to our universities than does any country except China. We also have a range of cultural links with the US, from the modern-day actors who are big stars stateside, like Alan Cumming, to the earliest Scots who left this land to settle in the new world, for whatever reason. John Farquhar Munro talked about the Scots who left our shores, from the explorers and pioneers to the people who had no choice but to leave. Such cultural links are not necessarily to do with the performing arts but are about identity and show us exactly who we are.</p><p>Members talked about the contribution of Scots to the American declaration of independence, which was signed by descendants of Scots and inspired by the ambitions that were set out in the declaration of Arbroath. Students of the Scottish enlightenment tell us that the US electoral college, which elects US presidents, was devised by David Hume, whose grave is only a few hundred yards from this chamber. John Paul Jones, the founder of the US navy, was also a Scot. I could mention many others.</p><p>People in Scotland have had a long and mostly harmonious relationship with people in America. We should foster and enhance that relationship. Tartan week offers an opportunity to put Scotland on the map in the US and in Canada. This Government will make the most of that opportunity and any others that we find. The First Minister has made it clear in Parliament that his Government will be the most outward-looking one that Scotland has had. Tartan week offers us an opportunity to make progress in that regard.</p><p>As Patricia Ferguson said, tartan week has had a chequered history and has not always attracted positive comments. We have come to a natural hiatus; Grand central station will not be available in 2008, so we have an opportunity to sit back and think about what we want to do with tartan week in the future. For good reasons, the focus of the previous Administration's activities was, predominantly, New York. Perhaps that was the best approach while the event was being built, but perhaps we should now look at other areas that are equally important to us. Boston and California spring to mind, and Canada, where the origins of tartan day lie&#8212;we have heard about that&#8212;offers big opportunities to increase our profile.

I urge members please to get in touch with me if they have ideas.</p><p>I was particularly interested in Bashir Ahmad's maiden speech&#8212;well done to him. As he said, tartan day is an example that shows what it means to be Scottish. All strands of society and people throughout our nation should be involved in it because it can be seen as representing our Scotland, our own tartan land, in which cultures are interwoven to make a fine pattern.</p><p>Andrew Welsh and other members talked about celebrating tartan day throughout Scotland, but perhaps we should also look outward. The Government is working with several Scottish organisations that are organising events to celebrate the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of India's independence and the founding of Pakistan. That is interesting. Those events will celebrate links between Scotland and India and Pakistan. For those who are interested in that work, we will soon publish details of it on the Government's website.</p><p>Last year, more events than ever in New York showcased Scottish literature, theatre, music, history and design, but we want to work to make its celebrations better. It is a grand triumph, for example, that the National Theatre of Scotland will tour America with \"Black Watch\" and \"The Wolves in the Walls\". John Farquhar Munro said that we should move beyond the performing arts. I am interested in that idea. I love the idea of an event that is centred on shinty and shipbuilding. That could work well.</p><p>An independent evaluation of tartan week is being finalised. The report will go into the mix in order to help us to make the right decisions.</p><p>Andrew Welsh's motion recognises the work of Parliament, the Government and Angus Council in establishing tartan day. I want that successful work to continue. It is much more likely that a united Scotland approach to the United States will be more successful than a disjointed approach. I commend Angus Council for its work in establishing its own tartan day events, of which there are many&#8212;indeed, I was amazed by the number of them. I also commend it for its vision for 2020, which is an inspiration to other local authorities. I applaud its long view through to the 700<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the declaration of Arbroath.</p><p>We should recognise the Scottish diaspora's hugely important contribution to establishing tartan <place-holder colnum=\"1205\"/> day&#8212;people who have left our shores have been mentioned. In the many countries in which tartan day is commemorated&#8212;Australia and New Zealand are another two such countries&#8212;Scots and people of Scottish descent have voluntarily used 6 April to celebrate their ancestry and this country's contribution to their new homelands. Without them, this country would be culturally and spiritually poorer.</p><p>It is often said that our people are our greatest asset, but it could also be said that our overseas people are potentially our greatest asset. We must engage more with them and provide them with a reason to continue their efforts.<place-holder colnum=\"1206\"/></p><p>The debate has been useful and constructive, and again, I thank Andrew Welsh for securing it.

I do not think that the Parliament has missed a year of marking Fairtrade fortnight. In addition, there has never been a fair trade debate in the Parliament in which I have not mentioned Strathaven and Avondale. I am pleased to say that, tomorrow&#8212;yet again&#8212;14 schoolchildren from Avondale, who won the Fairtrade poster competition this year, will be coming to Edinburgh to see their national Parliament. They will be really pleased that we have held this debate.</p><p>I have noticed that it has started to become quite fashionable of late to criticise the Fairtrade movement. People have asked what difference a couple of extra cents makes, or a couple of extra soles for coffee in Peru, for instance, to refer to a recent criticism. That is fine&#8212;I can see why people want to be cynical these days. As far as I am concerned, however, if we are getting the idea of fair trade into the national psyche and if we are starting with schoolchildren such as those from Avondale who are coming through tomorrow, that is very important.</p><p>We must make fair trade thinking the norm and then take the wider issues into account, too. We all recognise that the issues around fair trade cannot be considered in isolation. There are trade justice and debt adjustment issues. There are also the World Trade Organisation rules&#8212;which I am always railing against&#8212;which actively work against real fair trade. That applies to copyright and intellectual property rules in particular.</p><p>I was horrified to learn the other day about a case involving a company in the United Kingdom. The Kikoy Company UK Ltd is trying to trademark an anglicised version of the word \"kikoi\", which would prevent kikoi producers in Kenya from selling their national dress in Europe. That is a piece of absolute nonsense. Members might remember a similar fuss over basmati rice a few years ago, when an American company tried to trademark the word \"basmati\" so that Indian producers could not use it or sell their product. That, too, was ridiculous.</p><p>Fair trade issues go much wider than small consumer goods. We are now talking about fair <place-holder colnum=\"33026\"/> trade nationhood, which is wonderful. I was fortunate enough to question the minister about the matter last week at question time. I believe that, if we aspire towards fair trade nationhood, we must take it really seriously. It is about much more than tea, coffee and other consumables. The key, as Christine May suggested, is procurement by public bodies, with consideration being given to fair trade procurement where that is at all feasible, whether the fairness in trade relates to producers at home or producers overseas.</p><p>The minister said last week, in response to my question, that European rules preclude a lot of measures, but in fact it is not that simple. I looked at the Executive's procurement guidance, which, alas, relates only to catering. It details the Executive's view that fair trade requirements cannot be specified in tender documentation and says that Scottish Executive policy may only encourage. My first thought on reading that guidance was that we should have a go and challenge the situation. Then I came across the inquiry by the Westminster International Development Committee into fair trade and development. The committee was clear in asking whether existing Government guidelines work against fair trade, and it concluded that they do. After much study, the committee concluded that the UK&#8212;ergo Scotland&#8212;has got it very wrong. The Government does not do nearly enough to promote fair trade and, rather than enabling fair trade procurement, it constrains it.</p><p>Evidence that was submitted to the committee states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"EU legislation is not concerned with what is being procured\"&#8212;</p><p>the stuff that goes out from Government in this country says that it is&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"but rather how it is being procured.\"</p><p>In fact, it is possible to make explicit reference to fair trade in contract documentation. The Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and Oxfam in Scotland have sent us information on the matter. SCIAF notes:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the contracting authority can procure whatever it wants\",</p><p>with</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the European Commission itself making such fair trade specifications without difficulty.\"</p><p>Oxfam notes:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Madrid, in support of their bid for the Olympic Games, included a tender for a supply of fair trade t-shirts\".</p><p>Oxfam also mentions moves by Bonn, Barcelona, Utrecht, Zuid-Holland, Lyon and Bilbao. On procurement rules, it says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The non-discriminatory thrust of EU rules is aimed against those member states that seek to give unfair <place-holder colnum=\"33027\"/> advantage to their own national suppliers over suppliers from other member states within the European single market.\"</p><p>If authorities keep to those rules, it is not actually a matter of what they procure.</p><p>The Executive has often been accused of being overcautious in implementing and transposing EU directives. That is an argument for another day&#8212;we have had quite a few such arguments lately. The issue is far too important to be arguing over. We ought to work together to get it sorted. I would like to hear a pledge from the minister to study personally and carefully the results of the International Development Committee's inquiry; to ask for advice from organisations such as Oxfam and SCIAF; and to come up with a policy that ensures that, rather than being accused of paying lip service to fair trade when we go for fair trade nationhood, we genuinely become a fair trade nation in a way that people can be proud of and which will inspire others.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13381386", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fairtrade"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christine May for giving us the opportunity to have the debate.

Sadly, that has not happened.</p><p>I must also say that whoever wrote the minister's speech or directed its content is not taking the housing debate in this country seriously enough. It was complete nonsense. We have heard for years about some of what she was saying. There was nothing new at all. We have heard before about how we have to focus on the whole market holistically. She also said that we should consider intervention when required&#8212;I find it worrying that, eight years down the line, we are still considering that approach. She said that the Executive is going to look at energy efficiency and building regulations. The Executive has had two chances to beef up building regulations&#8212;for example, to meet the lowest standard of sustainable housing in Scandinavian countries&#8212;but the Executive parties knocked those chances back. Now we are to look at them again.</p><p>Of course, it is not all bad. Looking at the market holistically is going to incorporate looking at land, infrastructure, supply and planning&#8212;we are \"going to\" do that, eight years down the line. The Executive's homestake programme is great, but I must say to Phil Gallie that the Executive is not building on a Tory embryo when it looks at shared equity. In the mid-1990s, when I was with Bute Housing Association, we tried that to take that approach in Argyll, but the Tory-run Scottish Office would not let us because it said that it would interfere with the free market. There is no Tory kudos for that programme.</p><p>The minister even said that the single survey was making a difference. I hope that it will make a difference, but it certainly is not making a difference yet, because it is not operational&#8212;we are still waiting for it to be introduced. It strikes me&#8212;again&#8212;that the Executive has a terrible habit of announcing that something is going to happen and then behaving as if it has already made everything fine. The Executive has not made everything fine, and eight years down the line, we are still talking about plans.</p><p>Tricia Marwick was right that a lot is not said in the Executive motion. For example, I am stunned that prudential borrowing&#8212;another great housing initiative that was mentioned two or three years ago&#8212;was not mentioned today. Many members have asked about the rights of councils to provide and build housing, and when Margaret Curran answered the same questions a couple of years ago, she referred to the wonderful new prudential borrowing initiative. Will the deputy minister, in his summing up, tell us where we are on that? Margo MacDonald told us about the good example from Midlothian Council, but what about the others? Have other local authorities been encouraged to borrow prudentially and provide houses?<place-holder colnum=\"32475\"/></p><p>What can I say about stock transfer? It was not even mentioned in the Executive motion or the minister's speech, despite clearly being in the amendment lodged by Tricia Marwick. The story of Glasgow is very sad. People were promised second-stage transfer; Wendy Alexander, the minister at the time, said that there was no plan B; and Malcolm Chisholm said a couple of months ago that there was no black hole. I can tell the chamber what there is none of&#8212;there is no second-stage transfer in Glasgow.</p><p>We keep hearing from Labour and Liberal members about how wonderful community ownership is.

Community ownership has been happening for years, but the problem is that it needs to happen a lot more quickly. There is nothing new in the policy, as housing associations and co-operatives have been following it for years. We just need to step up the pace. Part of that involves organising what was promised to Glasgow tenants&#8212;second-stage transfer.</p><p>Perhaps if the Labour Party had listened to the SNP when Parliament debated the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 and enshrined in legislation the right of communities to community ownership, people in Glasgow might have had something by now. However, the Labour and Liberal Government knocked back enshrining in legislation the right to community ownership. I have never understood why it is that, although Labour municipal politicians have no problem with community ownership on islands and in rural areas, there is a big problem when it comes to urban areas and town centres, where they do not want to allow it.</p><p>In 2001, Labour and the Liberals also knocked back the right of people co-operatively to own their houses. In fact, co-operatives have had to change their status to continue to operate. The Labour Party is full of people who jump up on their hind legs and tell us what great stalwarts of the co-operative movement they are, but they will not allow tenants the right to own their houses in co-operatives. That is very strange.</p><p>The Executive's motion says nothing. Eight years down the line, it says what the Executive wants to do.

I declare an interest, as a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Housing. That membership exists from the days before I was elected, when I worked in housing associations. I have experience of dealing with homelessness applications from a service provider's point of view, as well as from a politician's. I think that I speak for most housing professionals when I say that there was always a particular poignancy when a young person presented as homeless&#8212;I felt helpless and that I could not be of real assistance to them.</p><p>My experience has given me a perspective on the issue that underpins my belief in the absolute necessity of tackling homelessness and seeking to eliminate it as far as is humanly possible. Part of that task is the provision of suitable and affordable housing, including owner-occupied and social rented housing. We all know that that is an issue in many areas. In East Kilbride, where I live, it is a particular problem. A major part of the task must also be helping people to avoid homelessness in the first place. That is the main thrust of the home smart campaign, which seeks to ensure that every fourth-year pupil in our schools knows that help and advice is available.</p><p>Great credit should be given to the Scottish Council for Single Homeless for creating the campaign. Its importance is underlined by the statistics on youth homelessness. In 2005-06, 19,400 young people between the ages of 16 and 24 turned to their local authority because they had nowhere safe and secure to stay. That is a rise of almost 4,000 since 1999. If we consider the figures for 16 and 17-year-olds, in 2005-06 more than 4,300 young people turned to their local authority. While few fourth-year pupils are likely to think that homelessness will affect them personally, the figures tell a different story.<place-holder colnum=\"31313\"/></p><p>There is a significant, worsening problem with youth homelessness that we owe it to Scotland's youngsters to address. With 3 per cent of young people in Scotland reporting as homeless each year, we cannot afford to turn away and hope that the problem resolves itself. We should be grateful to the Scottish Council for Single Homeless for the work that it has been doing and we should embrace the home smart campaign as an extremely worthwhile endeavour.</p><p>The council's idea for the campaign is simple, but appears to offer the right kind of help. Rather than waiting until the young person strikes out on their own, obtains a tenancy, then fails to maintain it and ends up homeless, it has taken the sensible step of taking the message into schools. The information in learning packs allows teachers and pupils to consider the issues that often arise with tenancies and young people, and to consider how they might avoid the pitfalls that have befallen so many in the past. As well as facilitating discussion, the packs offer sensible advice, including, for example, advice about how to ensure that the behaviour of one's friends does not affect one's tenancy. That seems fairly straightforward to those of us sitting here, but one of the major problems that young tenants have is in controlling their home environment and not letting it turn into a community centre for their friends.</p><p>I wish to make it clear, though, that the campaign is not an entirely new venture for the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. The I'm offski! learning materials were first produced in 1988 and have won awards. However, home smart goes even further. The experience of the organisation over many years is illustrated by its developing and innovatory campaigns. It will soon produce an evaluation toolkit to measure the success of the campaign&#8212;I am sure that it will be very successful. Getting pupils to think about the issues while they are still in the fourth year of secondary school will ensure that the information is embedded and that they know that support and advice is available.</p><p>Targeting the campaign at fourth years is important&#8212;I believe that it is the optimum age group to target. It is the age group that is perhaps desperate to leave home for negative reasons. It is an age group that may have a rose-tinted view of how one can strike out on one's own and be a success. Many young people who are at a stage in their lives when they should be building for the future can struggle to find the resources just to survive. Surviving day by day instead of planning for their future leaves them vulnerable to all sorts of outside influences. Home smart is about trying to stop that happening.</p><p>It is hard to judge how many pupils have so far been exposed to the materials produced by the <place-holder colnum=\"31314\"/> council, but around a third of our mainstream schools have indicated a strong interest. That points towards a possible 20,000 pupils.

I have no issue at all with Margaret Curran's motion. I could nitpick about it if I really wanted to but, as Kenny MacAskill said, today should be a celebration of the work of past, present and future trade unions. The Tory amendment is a bit disingenuous, so we will not be supporting that.</p><p>The work of trade unions for workers in Scotland has been covered, so I will focus on the movement's support and campaigning work. We all know that the trade union movement in Scotland is overwhelmingly opposed to all nuclear weapons and does not support the replacement of Trident. Unions also believe that there are grounds to justify an independent inquiry into the use of Scottish airports by Central Intelligence Agency rendition flights and do great work in campaigning against dawn raids and for the rights of asylum seekers and their children.<place-holder colnum=\"30026\"/></p><p>I would like the Government and Parliament to join those campaigns. The STUC does not recognise matters as being reserved or devolved; it just recognises whether issues are right or wrong and campaigns accordingly.</p><p>In international matters, too, our unions have long supported trade unionists in adversity and solidarity causes. The Fire Brigades Union's long hard work to help the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa is an example of that.</p><p>Trade union rights in Central and Latin American nations are a particular interest of mine. I was privileged to meet trade unionists in Peru while it was under the oppressive Fujimori regime. Thankfully, things in Peru are improving somewhat, but they must be watched carefully. Despite all the talk about the sweep of the left wing and socialism through Latin America, there are still quite a few countries in the region that have not been caught up in that change and could do with being watched. When Gilberth Berm&#250;dez, the general secretary of Costa Rica's SITRAP union visited me a few years ago and told me of the on-going struggle in his country against the world's largest fruit companies and when Doris Calvo spoke at the SNP conference of her people's struggle against the kidnapping and intimidation of union activists, I was glad to know that Bill Spiers, the STUC and trade union members throughout Scotland were offering support.</p><p>However, the struggle is still going on. SITRAP banana and pineapple members have been threatened with mass sackings and, inside the plantations in Costa Rica, there is a permanent and intense campaign to intimidate and threaten workers with blacklisting or plantation closure if they join the union. Trade unionists throughout Scotland are still working to help their fellow workers on the other side of the world.</p><p>That brings me to my final point, which relates to the political levy. I understand why the political levy was put in place and agree with the reasons for doing that, as it provided necessary support for the labour movement at the time. However, times have changed. I would like union funds to be used to support international solidarity for workers. As an example of how that can be done, I have examined what SASK, the Trade Union Solidarity Centre of Finland, is doing. It was founded by the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions and its affiliated unions in 1986 and functions as part of the Finnish and international trade union movement to strengthen trade unions in every corner of the world. That is what we should be about: the international solidarity of those who have to work for a living.</p><p>SASK promotes social and economic equality in the developing countries in the Baltic region and in <place-holder colnum=\"30027\"/> the new democracies close to Finland by supporting organisations that are not as strong as it is. I am particularly interested in a project that it is funding in Peru, which is designed to bring together the two unions that operate in the mining industry, in which there are many abuses of workers. SASK's projects are jointly planned and implemented by workers from the local organisations. SASK's activities are funded by member unions, the Government of Finland and the European Commission. A branch or an individual member of a trade union can support SASK's projects by regularly paying a percentage or by being a support member. I think that that model is something that trade union members across our country would think was a good idea and would be happy to support.</p><p>The Executive's motion talks about how we achieved a new politics in Scotland. I would like that new politics, which has engaged civic society, to move on. I think that allowing our unions freely to assist trade unions and their members across the world would be a good way for that to happen.</p>", "hdate": "2006-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13373290", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Civic Participation (Trade Unions)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare my membership of the Transport and General Workers Union and the highly active Scottish National Party trade union group.

Many organisations were naturally concerned by the reduced level of funding that would come from the European Union via Westminster and how that funding would be administered. The committee responded to those concerns.</p><p>I speak on behalf of all committee members when I say that the inquiry was extremely interesting. The evidence received, both written and oral, was substantial and of a quality that reflected the knowledge and commitment of those who have worked with and administered such European funds in the most recent funding period. I thank all those who contributed, as well as the Scottish Executive for its speedy response to our report.</p><p>The committee agreed to structure the inquiry around eight questions that would inform members' deliberations and understanding of how stakeholders viewed the current operational structures and how those structures should be adapted to benefit the country best, in the knowledge that funding would vastly reduce. The committee welcomed the Executive's statement that no final decisions had been taken on the future delivery of structural funds in Scotland and therefore the committee's inquiry and report came at an opportune time to inform the Executive's decision taking.</p><p>Members who read the committee report will have noted the level of detail involved. There is not enough time today for me to do justice to the amount of work carried out by those who contributed to the inquiry. I can, however, relay to the chamber the conclusions and recommendations reached. Other committee members will provide in their speeches further detail on the specifics. I have no doubt that Irene Oldfather will pick up on all the things that I miss in this opening speech.<place-holder colnum=\"28683\"/></p><p>With regard to the current structure of structural funds programme delivery and the potential advantages and disadvantages of changing it, the committee concluded that although the programme management executive structure that managed the structural funds programmes from 2000 to 2006 did a good job in establishing a bottom-up, partnership approach that has been lauded throughout Europe, the reduced funding levels require and dictate change. Even though structural funds make up a small percentage of the total regional development moneys in Scotland, it is vital that the money available is spent wisely to achieve the best results.</p><p>The Executive told the committee that the current cost of the programme management executive to the public purse was approximately &#163;4.5 million a year and that costs could fall to between &#163;750,000 to &#163;1.5 million if the system were restructured and streamlined. The committee believes that that is a significant and welcome saving in administration costs that should free up more money for projects.</p><p>The committee is mindful of the potential pitfalls of changing to a new structure and is concerned about the added burden that any transition would place on resources. It could have a particular impact on smaller organisations, and adequate support must be provided by the Executive to minimise that burden.</p><p>The Executive's proposal to move to a Highlands and Islands programme and a lowland and upland Scotland programme must not result in a loss of local accountability, and any new structure should harness current expertise effectively.</p><p>In the past day or so, there have been media reports about the potential loss of jobs and projects because of the late commencement of the 2007 to 2013 programmes, and I am sure that other members will elaborate on that. The committee was certainly mindful of the issue and thoroughly questioned the Executive on the potential funding gap and the requirement for transitional funding. At first, the minister was optimistic that the new programmes would begin on time, on 1 January 2007. In fact, he rather annoyed me by suggesting that the committee's glass was always half empty while the Executive's glass was always half full. In light of what we now know, I suggest that the minister gets a bigger glass.</p><p>The committee believes that there is a danger that the transition from the 2000 to 2006 programmes to the 2007 to 2013 programmes could lead to a lot of instability, which could have serious economic impacts on current and future projects. Steps must be taken to address all those <place-holder colnum=\"28684\"/> concerns and, where necessary, to provide transitional support.</p><p>The committee recommends that the Scottish Executive urgently put in place appropriate transitional planning that meets the European Commission's requirements and the needs of those who plan and deliver projects in Scotland. I gather from hints in its response to the committee's report and from media reports that emerged last night and today that the Executive will now proceed towards introducing transitional arrangements. I look forward to hearing more about that matter from the minister.</p><p>The committee also recommends that every possible effort be made to enable new programmes to begin on time. Obviously, since the report was published, we have learned that that will not happen, so I must stress the second part of the committee's recommendation, that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there are no financial or staff costs to projects as a result\".</p><p>There was much discussion by the committee and in external forums on how structural fund delivery should be linked to Scottish Executive priorities. Although the committee agrees that a close link is important for the sake of complementarity and to avoid the duplication of resources, it was clear that such a link to domestic priorities should not mean that structural funds are used in place of a committed Scottish Executive budget to fund established projects outwith the structural funds programmes. Structural funds should always provide added value and be additional to committed domestic spend. As Fife Council said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Executive does need to co-ordinate activity across its departments and ensure that Structural funds are providing additionality and not simply replacing domestic spending\".</p><p>The committee therefore recommends that the Executive uphold the principle of additionality at all times when planning and approving programmes.</p><p>With regard to the main priority areas for the new programmes, the committee understands that the European Commission has set specific targets that require a large percentage of funds to be spent on projects that support the Lisbon strategy, particularly under the competitiveness objective. However, the allocation of funds should, where possible, address issues such as social exclusion, the economically inactive and infrastructure as well as economic growth and development. The committee recommends that the Scottish Executive make an assessment of the impact of any reduction in competitiveness objective funds for infrastructure and tourism projects and indicate whether it intends to reprioritise other budgets as a result. Of course, clearly identified economic and social outputs should be established to measure <place-holder colnum=\"28685\"/> projects' effectiveness. Those outputs should be measured against desired outcomes; after all, as we know, outputs and outcomes are very different things and should not be confused.</p><p>The committee acknowledges that because of European Commission stipulations there is limited opportunity for infrastructure projects. However, it understands that, although the Department for Trade and Industry has agreed a 50:50 split between European regional development fund and European social fund moneys, it is up to the Scottish Executive to determine the convergence objective split between ERDF and ESF funds. The committee supports a weighting in favour of ERDF. It also understands that there is more flexibility on this matter in the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>Although the broad priorities should focus on economic, social and environmental sustainability, there are, as we all know, accessibility and connectivity issues that must be addressed, along with improving infrastructure where possible. In the committee's view, those issues contribute fundamentally to the Lisbon strategy goals in the longer term.</p><p>The committee recommends that there should be two programmes in Scotland to deliver structural funds from 2007 to 2013&#8212;one for the Highlands and Islands and one for lowland and upland Scotland&#8212;and both should have separate ERDF and ESF programmes within them. The committee also recommends that the programmes that cover lowland and upland Scotland should include geographical targeting where necessary and appropriate, and I understand that tender documentation based on that model has now been put out by the Executive.</p>", "hdate": "2006-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13369552", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Structural Funds Programmes 2007 to 2013"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The remit of the inquiry carried out by the European and External Relations Committee was to look into the Scottish Executive's plans for the delivery of structural funds in Scotland from 2007 to 2013.

There is much to be answered. I will do the big UK picture first because I feel that the things that were said about that require answers.</p><p>Mike Pringle talked about the UK's commitment to achieving the UN target for aid of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. There is no reason why that target cannot be achieved now&#8212;after all, we signed up to it decades ago through the UN but never achieved it. Des McNulty spoke about the UK being a trailblazer. Although I think that Gordon Brown has done rather well, I would not go beyond that. I put it to members that the Scandinavian countries have been the trailblazers because they, unlike the UK, met the UN target some time ago. Small independent countries throughout Europe have also met that commitment and Scotland, too, could do that. Many members spoke of what people do, and have been doing for years, to help in Malawi, other parts of Africa, and, indeed, in places all over the world. I suspect that what is now happening is that the Government is falling behind the aspirations of the people, who are looking for much more.</p><p>I am going to be nice now because the holidays are coming up. We will finish on a positive note. As I said, there were many interesting contributions to the debate. Murdo Fraser, Karen Gillon and Irene Oldfather, particularly, spoke of school links. I was also interested in what Murdo Fraser said about households in Malawi being headed by seven-year-olds. I learned a lot about that during my short trip to Malawi.</p><p>Karen Gillon said that primary education is now free in Malawi. That is great and it is wonderful that Malawi has achieved that, but when I was there I learned that in many rural areas people still pay for primary education because knowledge about the law that such education should be free has not filtered through to those areas. That relates to the lack of a democratic and governmental infrastructure to feed information to people. Even if education is free, how can a seven-year-old who heads a household go to school to take advantage of education if their day-to-day existence involves trying to earn a living to be able to feed their siblings? I welcome the statistics, but I think that we should look behind them and recognise that there is still a lot to do.</p><p>I was particularly taken by one of Karen Gillon's stances. Other members mentioned this, too, but she started the strand of discussion on the point that we cannot be seen as imposing ourselves on others, which is right. One thing that always concerns me is the perception that we get from the media here that Africa is always in trouble and needing handouts and that Africans are not quite <place-holder colnum=\"27132\"/> able to manage things for themselves. Some of the most vibrant, educated people whom I have ever met, who are spot on about how to achieve things, have come from African communities. It is a shame that Africa is never shown in a positive light in countries such as ours but always portrayed negatively. It is also patronising to assume that what we regard as the best way of life in our countries and the best way of doing things should just be imposed on others.</p><p>When I was in Malawi, quite a few African folk spoke to me about another aspect. The discussion, which I found fascinating, was about the dependency culture that can be created when the west comes in with great intentions and imposes things. A Malawian chap gave me an example of that. He said that although it is wonderful to see secondary schoolchildren from Scotland&#8212;or France, Germany or Spain&#8212;taking part in a project to build a small rural school, when that happens the Malawian schoolchildren stand and watch. The Malawian children do not have the opportunity to volunteer and take part in a joint effort, which does not promote the sense of the common good that is required if communities are to be able to build themselves up. We are getting better at acknowledging that aid of all types must be delivered differently.</p><p>Alex Johnstone talked about cash cropping, which was a huge issue under corrupt Governments in Latin America, where people starved while asparagus and other crops were shipped round the world to people who could afford to buy them. Such cash cropping remains an issue in Africa. We must learn from the mistakes that were made in the past and, thankfully, Latin America is turning a corner in that regard&#8212;politically and environmentally.</p><p>As Alex Johnstone said, food is sometimes available but unobtainable. I talked to a fantastic woman from the north of Malawi who is a community activist. She told me that in her area some fruit is not recognised as food, although it would be a sustainable food. Folk in the village think that only animals eat the fruit, so she is taking part in a project through which fruit trees are planted in people's gardens and well-known, respected local people are recruited to go about eating apples and bananas, so that the villagers start to regard such fruit as normal food. I was fascinated to learn about that project.</p><p>Another form of cash cropping leads to the environmental degradation of Malawi's forests. The sale of charcoal across the border to Mozambique is a huge problem. The trade is illegal but represents an example of a law that cannot be properly enforced, for various reasons&#8212;it is easy to criticise that from a secure standpoint. As Irene Oldfather said, there is a <place-holder colnum=\"27133\"/> need for sustainable jobs, so that people do not have to degrade their environment and living conditions in order to feed their families.</p><p>James Douglas-Hamilton talked about health training, which is crucial. Hospitals and clinics are needed, but health staff must also be trained so that they can work with people in rural communities. I was fascinated to hear about a project at the University of Dundee, which provides distance learning for nurses in Eritrea and Kenya. I hope that nurses in Malawi will be able to take advantage of that project. People do not need just a standard health course; they need to learn about the health care that their communities need.</p><p>In Malawi, we should aim for security in jobs, food, energy, health and the environment. When there is a measure of such security, we will be able to say that we have made a difference.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13365823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Development and Co-operation with Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been an interesting debate and I have enjoyed every speech.

A year on from the G8 summit, this is an appropriate juncture at which to discuss international development and Malawi.</p><p>As the minister said, some progress has been made since last year on the commitments that were made at the G8 summit, but it is generally recognised by people of every political persuasion that there is still a sense of disappointment about those grand promises. In some cases, debt relief being offset against aid has not fulfilled the promises that were made.</p><p>People recognise that what we can do in the Parliament and in the Scottish Executive is fairly small, but it is right that we should focus on Malawi, because of the historical links between our countries. It is also right that we should look at the bigger picture to see how everything fits in. Because this is a debate with no motion, I think that a lot of personal views will be expressed in members' speeches this afternoon. My personal view is that there can be so many good, worthy initiatives going on at all levels that we sometimes forget about the major issues.</p><p>One of the major issues for Africa is public health. There are a lot of initiatives around HIV/AIDS at the moment, for example. Then there are malaria and tuberculosis campaigns, and that is great, because it all needs to be done. However, when we look at how public health developed in our own societies, we see that it was about infrastructure for potable water and sewage. Although there are small initiatives across Africa&#8212;I believe that the Executive is funding such a project run by Mercy Corps in Zimbabwe&#8212;until we can guarantee people across that continent good infrastructure for potable water and sewage, we <place-holder colnum=\"27102\"/> cannot really say that we are tackling the public health problems. That is what I am trying to get at when I talk about the lack of a strategic overview across the nations that are able to help.</p><p>Another big issue is trade. However we look at it, western trade policies are hard to defend. I hope that the new G8 round and the next World Health Organisation round will have everyone, including Governments that profess to care, lobbying for real change in trade rules. I am also aware that there are trade barriers even within the continent of Africa. That is another discussion that has to go on&#8212;internally within the continent as well as externally.</p><p>It is not just countries that consider themselves western democracies that are participating in Africa. I understand that China has become Africa's fastest growing business partner, with trade up 37 per cent last year. Commentator Hamish McRae has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"You could almost say that western relations with Africa are dominated by aid, while Chinese relations are dominated by trade.\"</p><p>The view of some people on the ground is that China is taking in its own workers, carrying out the work and then leaving, so its policies on trade with Africa do not really have a legacy of self-sufficiency. Perhaps, in the new spirit of co-operation that the west has with China, such an approach could be encouraged.</p><p>I have spoken about fragmentation and about the fact that lots of little initiatives are going on. One of the things that stuns me about Malawi and which harks back to that 150-year history of our relationship with the country is the number of folk in this country who have been carrying out such initiatives for years and years. I recently met people from the Kwenderana group, run jointly by churches around the Busby area. For years, that group has been funding a small school in northern Malawi and has been sending out goods and equipment. The minister referred to ordinary Scots making a difference, and that has been happening in Malawi over the piece.</p><p>I am pleased that one of the projects that has been funded&#8212;I think that the University of Edinburgh will carry out the work&#8212;is a Scotland-Africa directory, so there will be a database that shows exactly what is happening. I hope that the minister can confirm that smaller voluntary groups that are not attached to non-governmental organisations can have their work added to that database, so that we have an overall picture of what is happening.</p><p>Another big issue in Africa and in Malawi in particular is the lack of a democratic structure. That cannot be denied when we talk about Malawi. I would like to praise the work of a Westminster-<place-holder colnum=\"27103\"/> based organisation, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, which believes that properly functioning political parties are the key to an effective pluralist democracy. The WFD funds, to varying degrees, political parties that have representation at Westminster&#8212;the SNP is a beneficiary of those funds.</p><p>I recently went out to Malawi with the WFD along with my colleague Pete Wishart to see whether there were political parties with which the SNP could logically join up. It was a very interesting trip and we met a lot of people, but one thing that stuck out was that there are no grass-roots organisations that lead into politics. Political parties are formed from the top down. For example, as soon as the current president was elected, he left his political party and started another party because he fell out with the first one. I say as an aside that it is interesting that the Liberal Democrats are linked to both parties&#8212;that is a very Liberal Democrat thing to do.</p><p>The SNP has agreed that we will link with two of the smaller parties: the People's Progressive Movement and the People's Transformation Party. We will head back out to Malawi fairly soon to carry out training for women and youths&#8212;that work is very important for the future of any democracy. People say that it is ridiculous to fund political parties, but they can be the bedrock of a society that will grow and become a functioning democracy.</p><p>I am getting hard looks from the Deputy Presiding Officer because my time is up. I would love to say much more as there is so much to be said on the subject, but I will stop now.

We say all the right things, but the question is what we are doing to achieve greater race equality in our society.</p><p>A few members have already referred to the extremely useful briefing from the Commission for Racial Equality. The briefing states clearly:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"progress towards race equality in Scotland is still not happening fast enough\".</p><p>It also reiterates one of my concerns, which is that progress</p><p class=\"indent\">\"remains patchy and often relies on isolated initiatives.\"</p><p>The lack of a big picture worries me somewhat. An awful lot of grand initiatives are under way, and some of them are wonderful&#8212;Dave Petrie talked about the many community initiatives that are aimed at delivering different elements of the strategy. However, we perhaps sometimes miss the big picture of what we are trying to achieve.</p><p>Racial discrimination is varied. There is the direct discrimination that some members have spoken about, and a couple of members have mentioned the absolute racism of England supporters being beaten up. It strikes me that those incidents have received a large amount of publicity, given that every blooming day people suffer direct racial abuse because they happen to have a brown face or do not have English as their first language. As racist events, such incidents do not receive nearly as much publicity. That is not to downplay the horror of the other occasions that have been mentioned, but there is a kind of indirect racism in our society that does not accord the same importance to what happens daily as it affords to incidents involving people whose ethnicity is English, Welsh or European generally. <place-holder colnum=\"26964\"/></p><p>Sadly, the colour of people's skin is an issue.</p><p>Indirect discrimination happens all the time. It is inadvertent&#8212;people do not even realise that they are guilty of it. We must raise awareness of that kind of racism, just as we must keep ensuring that institutional racism is stamped out. That is still an issue, despite the Chhokar case and the Lawrence case in England. We are not yet free of institutional racism. We must continue to monitor the issue and to work towards improving the situation.</p><p>Stereotyping is something else that we do. I had a wry smile on my face when Dave Petrie referred to the arrival of the Italian community and how much we all loved its ice cream parlours. What a stereotype that is. I say to him that we started in chip shops and moved on to ice cream parlours&#8212;he should get his facts right next time. I am not trying to get at Dave Petrie. The Italian community has internalised the stereotype and turned that kind of humour on itself, for various historical reasons that I do not have time to go into. I often think of myself as a third-generation Italian. I do not suffer racism, but if I were third-generation African, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Chinese, I would suffer racism because of how I looked and spoke. That is inherently wrong.</p><p>What are we going to do about it? I am glad that the minister is looking to develop further the Scottish Executive's one Scotland strategy. My concern is that it focuses very much on direct racism. I would like the final documentation that will come out over the next few years to be expanded to address the more hidden types of racism that also exist.</p><p>The minister focused on three main themes: employment, the Scottish refugee integration forum and mainstreaming. I am glad that he put on record the fact that the forum covers asylum seekers, because there is some confusion about that. The ethnic minorities and the labour market strategic group that Dr Charan Gill is heading up will look at labour issues. As some members have rightly pointed out, non-white people from ethnic minorities are less successful in the labour market. I have heard some mutterings about what the group's findings will be. Will the minister clarify whether the data that are being used to formulate the report, which will appear at the end of next month, are specific to Scotland? Do we have sufficient data to back up the report, or do we merely have extrapolated UK data, because much of what is involved&#8212;employment legislation, for example&#8212;is reserved? If we are serious about moving forward in this area, we need to know that the base data from which we start are absolutely right. We know that it is no longer true that ethnic minorities constitute 2 per cent of the population of <place-holder colnum=\"26965\"/> Scotland. We need to update that figure, which came from the 2001 census.</p><p>I ask the minister what representations he has made to the Home Office on the specific issue of reinstating the right-to-work concession to asylum seekers in Scotland. Under a European directive, it is perfectly acceptable for asylum seekers to work. In fact, if a decision on an asylum seeker's status has not been made a year after their arrival, they should have the right to work. What representations are we making to ensure that level of equality?</p><p>I note that, although the Scottish refugee integration forum action plan is expected later in the year, it is already late&#8212;we were promised it before then. I ask the minister to be more specific about how much later it will be. There are also concerns about funding. I do not deny that admirable work and consultation are involved in the new action plan and that some really knowledgeable people are contributing, but we need to know when the action plan will be published and that budgets will be set for the beginning of 2007 so that we can move on.</p><p>Many Executive departments are still not carrying out proper race equality impact assessments in the mistaken belief that their initiatives and policies do not have a racial dimension. Absolutely everything has a racial dimension, just as everything has a gender dimension. I would like to hear from the minister that impact assessments will be mainstreamed properly across Government departments.</p><p>I finish with the SNP amendment. It is crucial that asylum seekers are granted equality with everyone else in our country and are not regarded as being somehow basic. The destitution of asylum seekers is horrendous. How does the Executive measure that, so that we can truly do something about it? Is the minister considering reintroducing an education maintenance allowance for the children of asylum seekers? Children of asylum seekers go through school&#8212;it is not as if they get a decision quickly&#8212;and want to go into further and higher education, but they cannot do that without an education maintenance allowance. Will the minister also consider changing the terms of the bursary regulations, which might ease the problem as well?</p><p>I have asked many questions, which I know the minister will try hard to answer. If he does not do so today, perhaps he will get back to me at some point in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13365452", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Race Equality"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have had many parliamentary debates on race equality since the Parliament was reconvened.

First of all, I inform the chamber that I do not seek local press releases because I would like to talk about the Executive's architecture and design policy.</p><p>The debate is about so much more than houses and boxes; it is about architecture and design. I believe that Jamie Stone has been the only person to mention the beauty of our surroundings. There is absolutely nothing wrong with creating something beautiful. We Scots with our Calvinist streak sometimes think that everything must be functional and must have a reason to exist. No&#8212;sometimes it is nice to be surrounded by and to appreciate beautiful things. As far as architecture and design are concerned, beauty should come towards the top of our list of criteria, while <place-holder colnum=\"26361\"/> acknowledging that certain elements must be functional. We can then use that approach to focus on aspects such as architecture for communities and housing.</p><p>Public art also comes into this matter. In that respect, Carolyn Leckie and Frank McAveety mentioned the Gorbals. As an aside, I agree that what has happened with architecture in that part of Glasgow has been disastrous, but the problem stems as much from the social conditions that were imposed at the time as from the design of homes. After all, high rises work in many places, especially for people with lots of money, because they can be beautiful and functional and can provide all the necessary facilities. They do not work when people are forced into them by social conditions. Similarly, garden cities and new towns are wonderful concepts, but other problems can make such places not quite as lovely as the architects and designers first imagined.</p><p>Returning to public art in the Gorbals, I cannot remember what the piece is called&#8212;I am sure that Carolyn Leckie or Frank McAveety will tell me later&#8212;but I think that the angels on the buildings in Crown Gardens are absolutely fantastic.

Just now, some fabulous Scottish architects, designers and engineers are creating wonderful designs. However, as members have pointed out, not all the design work that is being carried out is wonderful. Carolyn Leckie mentioned the schools project as an example of that. I know <place-holder colnum=\"26362\"/> that members have previously discussed ecoschools. If we gave design its proper place, instead of having standard-construction PPP buildings we could have wonderful schools that are conducive to learning and hospitals that are conducive to healing.</p><p>We should not just look backwards.

In Argyll, which Mr McGrigor represents, I have seen some wonderful new examples of that style&#8212;as well as some bad examples of the little boxes that Rob Gibson mentioned.</p><p>We do not have to go back to centuries-old design to make things of beauty. Rob Gibson referred to the award-winning house on Loch Eriboll, which shows that it is possible for new and innovative design to fit in with the surroundings. No one has mentioned Architecture and Design Scotland's travelling exhibition on rural housing, which I found fascinating. At this point, I must congratulate the minister on establishing Architecture and Design Scotland. Although the agency has not really entered the psyche of people in Scotland, I believe that it represents a way forward.</p><p>I will quote something that John Richards wrote in 1994. I had huge respect for him at the time when I worked in housing associations and I think that he is absolutely right. He wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There are many examples of new buildings which interact successfully with their older neighbours without attempting to copy past styles. Even within a group, design unity does not require uniformity. New houses should not normally be expected to look as like old houses as possible, but care should be taken in their design that they do not spoil, but enhance, the public's enjoyment of neighbouring buildings.\"</p><p>That is extremely important as a way to move forward.</p><p>Members talked about community involvement in design. I saw the importance of that during my years of working in housing associations, when I also worked with some fantastic architects. I have concerns about the time when design and build came in and schemes started to become developer led. That led to some uniformity, because capital costs rather than innovation and design were all-important. However, I believe that we are starting to break away from that.</p><p>An interesting example of progress is the building in Rothesay that won lots of awards. When I worked in Rothesay, I was involved in the feasibility study for the Foley House site. At that time, the feasibility study had to be about refurbishing the old building on the site and trying to cram as many box-like new houses as possible onto it. That approach was required due to the restrictions and the financial constraints under <place-holder colnum=\"26363\"/> regulation from the party that does not believe in regulation. It was impossible to achieve because the unit costs were too high. The building that is on the site now is much better. It is a fantastic, new, beautifully designed building that is gaining plaudits from all over the world and it is making local people very happy.</p><p>I am rabbiting on because I have so much to say.

It is good that Margaret Mitchell has secured the debate. She ably outlined her views on the problems that have occurred and on how South Lanarkshire Council has behaved.</p><p>I will speak just as someone who lives in Strathaven and who has tried to facilitate discussions between the council and Strathaven academy action group, which has proved hard. That is unfortunate. The council has been intransigent on the matter and I have received disingenuous letters from it. For example, back in March, the council said that the action group had never submitted its plans but, at that point, the action group was looking for a meeting at which it could ask for its plans to be considered. Such an approach does no one any good and creates the perception that local democracy has been bypassed. In relation to this case and others, I would like South Lanarkshire Council to be more amenable to discussing matters with people who are most directly affected.</p><p>I know that Strathaven academy action group's plan has now been submitted to the council. I say honestly, as I have to the group, that I do not know whether that is a really good option or a brilliant plan or whether it has been properly costed. I do not pretend to have the technical expertise that would allow me to make such judgments. However, the important point is that surely a local authority should not be dictatorial in how it deals with local people. The council should sit down to consider that plan and perhaps others, because a <place-holder colnum=\"25377\"/> solution that would suit everyone might be out there. I would like that discussion to take place; it is not too late for that.</p><p>I am not a parent and I do not have children at Strathaven academy, but I live in Strathaven and I am constantly approached by people who have grave concerns, which I share, about the two-year decant. Not least of the concerns is the bussing for two years of the academy's entire roll into and back from the Ballerup high school site in East Kilbride every day. That will involve using a horrible road&#8212;the A726 is not a good road. I do not want to be a scaremonger, but parents have huge concerns about their children going back and forth along that road every day. I have asked parliamentary questions about the road, which have shown that there is some confusion. One answer says that the route is a trunk road and another says that it is a local road. However, both answers show that no safety audit has been undertaken and that the Executive knows of no safety audit that is to be undertaken on that stretch of the A726. I ask the minister to take that on board and to ask his colleagues with relevant responsibility to ensure that the safety audit happens, because that road is notorious to those of us who live in the area.</p><p>Timing is another issue. Strathaven academy educates not only children who live in Strathaven town centre, but children who live in Avondale and the outlying areas. Those areas really are outlying. At the moment, youngsters from places such as Drumclog and further out, on the farms, are getting picked up before 8 o'clock in the morning to get to Strathaven academy in time for 9 o'clock. When they have to add on the extra time for the decanting into East Kilbride, what on earth time are we expecting children to get up in the morning in order to attend school?</p><p>Extra-curricular activities may well be missed. I noted in the local paper that South Lanarkshire Council has said that it will take steps to ensure that extra-curricular activities are not affected. With the best will in the world, I cannot see how the plan will not have some effect on extra-curricular activities.</p><p>I am aware of the time, so I will close shortly and allow others to speak, but another part of Margaret Mitchell's motion mentions that pupils from Strathaven academy have been selected to represent central Scotland at the Parliament on Sunday and Monday. Margaret gave them her congratulations, as do I. Strathaven academy is a marvellous school, and all of us who live in that community are very proud of it. It is not often that I say anything terribly nice about Andy Kerr. I know that, as a minister, he cannot speak in this debate, but I also know that he thinks very highly of Strathaven academy, as do all of us who live in <place-holder colnum=\"25378\"/> the town. We are very proud that the pupils are coming to Edinburgh this weekend. We do not want any of the good work that Strathaven academy does being eroded by some of the plans that South Lanarkshire Council sadly seems to have and refuses to consider altering.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361108", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strathaven Academy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to you, Presiding Officer, and to Margaret Mitchell for unavoidably having to leave early.

Indeed, even where it would be appropriate, its role is seldom appreciated. The UK Cabinet Office estimates that European Union legislation accounts for half of the total volume of regulation in the UK. In areas such as agriculture and the environment, the proportion is even higher.</p><p>EU legislation impacts on all aspects of life in Scotland. For example, it affects not only regional policy and structural funds&#8212;the European and External Relations Committee is about to begin an inquiry into the future disbursal and implementation of such funds&#8212;but transport, fisheries, research and development, enterprise and industry, and justice and home affairs.</p><p>Given that, in European Union terms, Scotland is a region of the EU rather than a member state with direct representation, it is crucial that the Parliament's European and External Relations Committee not only monitors the effects of EU legislation and regulation but actively seeks opportunities to influence new legislation that affects our country and, where appropriate, asks for existing legislation to be reconsidered.</p><p>The Parliament should actively grasp chances to influence legislation, where we see advantage in doing so. For that reason, the European and External Relations Committee considers the European Commission's legislative and work programme, which is published every year as part of the EU's legislative cycle. The work programme lists all the Commission's intended new legislation and indicates its thinking contained in green papers, communications, reports and reviews.</p><p>The committee first considered this year's work programme in November last year, shortly after it was published, and selected areas of potential interest for further consideration. The Executive also considers the Commission's work programme, and the committee has taken evidence from the relevant minister on the <place-holder colnum=\"24700\"/> Executive's priority programme of work and how it overlaps with that of the Commission. Other committees of the Parliament address specific subjects within their remits.</p><p>By considering the Commission's work programme, preparing their positions and making timeous representation, the Parliament's committees can try to influence the final shape of new and substantial legislation that is of importance to Scotland. Just as there are opportunities for private individuals and interest groups to respond directly to Brussels, there are opportunities for our committees to do so. For example, committees can submit direct responses to Commission green papers and can lobby the UK Government and the UK Parliament and its committees. The theory is that we have a favourable wind as, following the negative results of the French and Dutch referenda on the constitutional treaty, the Commission says it is particularly keen to listen to views from below member state level&#8212;from regional level, from citizens and from institutions close to them.</p><p>Although committee colleagues will have more detailed comments to make, I would like to point out some of the legislative developments that we can hope to influence and on which we can make our views known. The first is the proposal for a European institute of technology, which envisages the establishment of five centres of research across the European Union. The committee raised the issue with the Executive and continues to follow developments, to ensure that if there is potential for Scotland in the proposal, advantage is taken of it. We look forward to further proposals from the Commission, which are expected in June.</p><p>The second issue is the Commission's proposed green paper on adaptation to climate change, which will help to identify areas where action is needed at Community level to support the EU's adaptation to increasing adverse effects of climate change. The Environment and Rural Development Committee has engaged with that issue in the past, as has the European and External Relations Committee, during its consideration of the July G8 summit agenda. There may be further committee engagement with the issue in 2006.</p><p>Structural funds are another issue. Agreement on the budget for 2007 to 2013 at the December European Council has made possible progress on planning for structural funds programmes. The European and External Relations Committee has agreed to respond to the UK Government's consultation on the national strategic reference framework, focusing on the Scottish section, as the Scottish Executive is responsible for the delivery of funds in Scotland. The committee will also invite the Executive and others to give evidence on the disbursal of structural funds and <place-holder colnum=\"24701\"/> the implementation of programmes over the new budgetary period.</p><p>A further issue is energy. The committee will shortly consider its response to the Commission's green paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy. Sustainable development, covering areas such as renewables, carbon capture and energy efficiency, is likely to be a major focus of our interest. As everyone knows, some elements of energy policy are within the Parliament's remit.</p><p>There is a proposal to complete the internal market for postal services while maintaining safeguards to ensure that a universal postal service continues to be provided across member states. Although the issue is reserved, the proposal has potential implications for rural Scotland&#8212;remote areas and island communities&#8212;in particular. The committee has already taken up the issue with the Executive.</p><p>There is also the better regulation agenda. The work programme includes a dedicated section on better and more effective regulation, as part of the growth and jobs strategy.</p><p>A member of our committee, Jim Wallace, is currently engaged as rapporteur in an inquiry into the transposition and implementation of EU directives in Scotland. The committee is looking forward to considering the recommendations that will follow from that inquiry.</p><p>As I said earlier, the Scottish Executive has its own list of EU priorities for this year&#8212;some of which overlap with the Commission's programme&#8212;that it presented to the committee on 28 February. Some of those priorities are near the end of the legislative cycle, but others that have the committee's support are close enough to the start of the cycle for us to influence them, such as the European institute of technology. The committee is particularly pleased that the Executive agrees on the potential importance of that initiative for Scotland.</p><p>Other examples are the European qualifications framework and the applicable law and jurisdiction in divorce, with which the Justice 1 Committee has been actively engaged. It is crucial that the committees of the Parliament ensure that Scottish interests are taken fully into account.</p><p>That has not exhausted the list of issues that the European and External Relations Committee is tracking, but they are all issues of importance to Scotland and we have the opportunity to influence them if we wish&#8212;and in many cases we should. I do not have time to mention many of those issues so, to conclude, in the interests of Scotland this Parliament must ensure that it has mechanisms in place to understand, monitor and influence European policy. The Commission's work <place-holder colnum=\"24702\"/> programme is one element that enables such understanding. I am pleased to have presented a quick r&#233;sum&#233; of the work of the European and External Relations Committee to ensure that we have such understanding and promote our potential influence.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the European Commission's Legislative and Work Programme for 2006 and its importance for the work of the Parliament and its committees and to Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2006-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13359515", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Commission Work Programme 2006"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to open the debate on behalf of the European and External Relations Committee.

The minister started by talking about an issue that we have been discussing in western societies for a long time&#8212;the demographic change that cannot be ignored. There are many more older people in our societies. However, many members have made the point that older people are not a homogeneous group. Just as there are in any other walk of life or age span, there are many variations within the group.</p><p>I want to talk about a particular group about which I have spoken many times before&#8212;elderly carers, especially elderly parents of children with learning difficulties. There has been much talk about that issue of late, due in large part to the Murray Owen Carers Group in East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire, which has submitted petitions to the Parliament and has been very active in raising awareness through Enable. As a result of its activity, South Lanarkshire Council recently published a report that contains a great deal of information and which the Executive is considering.</p><p>There are some items of concern. Although I am quite knowledgeable about this subject, some points in the report really stunned me. We must bear in mind that its findings do not apply only to South Lanarkshire, but are likely to be relevant to the whole of Scotland. The report highlights the exacting nature of caring tasks for elderly parents. Two fifths of their sons and daughters living at home have an additional disability, such as epilepsy, erratic sleeping and dementia. Irene Oldfather talked about dementia in older people, but people with some forms of learning disability are prone to early-onset dementia with which elderly parents whose children still live at home have to deal. More than 42 per cent of family carers are lone parents and of them more than a quarter are over 70 years of age.<place-holder colnum=\"24399\"/></p><p>The problem is not just their living situation, but the fact that there seems to be disparity in different places&#8212;that takes us back to the postcode situation&#8212;in achieving assistance and getting information about help and services. That creates a terrible anxiety about the quality of the support that exists.</p><p>I have come to be very fond of the people I know who are over 80 and caring for their adult children at home. The report said that for many older family carers in South Lanarkshire, any new services might come too late and that the local authority should work with older carers as a matter of urgency. I found that particularly horrifying. The problem is probably Scotland-wide, and that is disturbing.</p><p>What brought the Murray Owen Carers Group to petition the Parliament was the publication of the report \"The same as you?\" The strategy was very worthy and the people who petitioned the Parliament had no problem with the principles of the report, but they said that despite the worthy attempts to ensure that people with learning difficulties who come from institutional care are properly placed and looked after in communities, those who still live in their family homes are not being provided for to the same extent.</p><p>Only one parent in the East Kilbride group of elderly carers of adults with learning difficulties has been able to get rented accommodation for her adult son to move into and that happened only after a crisis situation. That contrasts with the new accommodation that was recently provided for five residents so that they could move out of a hostel and into proper housing. That is not to say that those five residents should not have got that proper housing, but the needs of other groups must be considered, too.</p><p>We have spoken about demographic change and the fact that there are now more elderly people, but there has also been demographic change in relation to people with learning difficulties. The University of Lancaster carried out an interesting study on behalf of one of the Whitehall departments, although I cannot remember which one. The report says that there is good reason to believe that as a result of changes in the demographic profile of people with learning disabilities, changes in expectations and the pattern of informal care, the situation will become substantially more pressing over the following two decades.</p><p>I know that the Executive has seen and considered that academic study and that there are no plans to commission the same kind of research for Scotland. However, as I said, the South Lanarkshire situation is likely to be spread throughout Scotland and I imagine that the situation in England is similar. I ask the Executive <place-holder colnum=\"24400\"/> to consider carefully and with compassion the needs of elderly carers of adults with learning difficulties.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13358698", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aging Population Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That sounds like very good advice.

The clerking team and staff of the Scottish Parliament information centre also did a lot of work on the report.</p><p>I found it an extremely interesting report and I enjoyed contributing to its compilation. Since its publication, however, there have been changes, and the initiative has progressed in some ways.</p><p>The committee recognised in its report that, as a relatively new policy that aimed to tackle long-term issues, the fresh talent initiative would change and develop. No doubt, the minister will outline during the debate his perspective on progress made; likewise, others will express their views about the initiative's effectiveness and ambition. My role today is to reflect the findings and recommendations of the European and External Relations Committee.</p><p>The committee's first recommendation was that the Executive should set out clearly the purpose, direction and expectations of the initiative to help to ensure a better understanding of how the initiative fits into Scotland's economic strategy.</p><p>We recommended that as well as attracting external talent, the Executive should aim to mobilise Scotland's existing talent pool to the fullest extent, paying particular attention to the 688,000 people in Scotland who are economically inactive.

As part of that, another recommendation stated that in</p><p class=\"indent\">\"mobilising Scotland's existing talent, the Executive seeks to address any barriers to economic participation.\"</p><p>We recommended that the Executive should develop into policy the originally stated intention of <place-holder colnum=\"24158\"/> attracting skilled Scots and graduates back to work in Scotland.</p><p>In relation to potential new Scots contributing to our nation, the committee recognised existing examples. For example, we noted the Executive's recruitment efforts in Poland and recommended that such work should be undertaken in a proactive, promotional way in other accession states.</p><p>We also recognised the experience of the FirstGroup and suggested that it be promoted as an example of good practice in identifying and filling the skills gap.</p><p>In some of the recommendations, we expressed concern about the employment conditions and needs of potential workers in developing countries. We recommended that \"<strong>the Executive monitor recruitment processes to ensure it avoids depriving developing countries of needed skills through the Fresh Talent initiative\",</strong> and asked it to report back to the committee in that regard.</p><p>Some members expressed concern about the exploitation of workers who come to our country to work in certain sectors, and there was much discussion about the report's recommendation that \"<strong>the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board and other bodies should monitor proactively the employment of foreign labour through agencies to prevent unfair exploitation of foreign employees and to minimise the risk of friction between local and foreign workers.\"</strong></p><p>Of course, we also acknowledged that such workers need support to be able to fit in with our society, and recommended that \"<strong>the Executive consider the support that employers of Fresh Talent workers may need in taking into account the particular social, moral and cultural responsibilities that there may be in taking on non-UK workers.\"</strong></p>", "hdate": "2006-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13358171", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fresh Talent Initiative"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When I joined the European and External Relations Committee, it was just compiling the report \"An Inquiry into the Scottish Executive's Fresh Talent Initiative Examining the Problems It Aims to Address, Its Operation, Challenges and Prospects\".

Other countries comparable to ours manage to do so, but we do not, and until we meet that commitment we have no right to be parading about saying just how wonderful we are.</p><p>Patrick Harvie mentioned that it would be possible for this Parliament to do something, and indeed it would. We welcome the &#163;3 million that was announced for international development, and it is wonderful that this Parliament is taking a stand, but other devolved legislatures&#8212;in the Basque Country, for example&#8212;use a portion of their income for international development. I would like the Government in Scotland to say that that is something that it wants to achieve, and it is something that would gain cross-party support in this Parliament.</p><p>There are lots of different issues that could be mentioned, but as there is not enough time to cover them all, I want to highlight the hypocrisy of the developed countries in the European Union, whose own commissioned studies have come to the conclusion that trade liberalisation harms poor communities and environments, yet which still <place-holder colnum=\"24083\"/> push ahead with the agenda of pressing developing nations to agree to ambitious market targets. We have to stop pushing those poor countries, through the world trade talks, to open their economies in ways that suit us, and we must respect their right to decide their trade policies so that they can end poverty and protect the environment.</p><p>That is not a naive view, because I also recognise that there are highly inappropriate forms of democracy in some developing nations. Governance is a really big issue, so we also have to fund governance measures in a lot of those countries to ensure that the people who are worst affected actually help to make the decisions on how to move their countries forward. We can sometimes be a wee bit smug when we look at some of the things that we are achieving, and we tend to think that things are working well when the reality is often different.</p><p>I am going to say something about Malawi, because I was there last week and it is freshest in my memory. It may look on the surface as if we are doing really well with HIV/AIDS programmes in which there is take-up, and people are quite positive about how things are moving forward, but there is also evidence that there is not equality of access for treatment in some of those health programmes, because the poorer people are not getting the treatment. There are cultural reasons for that, so education at grass-roots level is needed in communities, so that they can grow and blossom into something that will help the country to make progress.</p><p>We talk about the fact that some African countries have achieved 100 per cent primary school education. That might be the law, and it is wonderful, but there are a heck of a lot of orphans out there who cannot get to school because they are looking after younger siblings and trying to earn money to keep the family. If there are about a million orphans in Malawi alone, that will be a huge issue for the future, and it is something that we must consider if we are serious about moving the country forward.</p><p>I am not knocking what people are doing, but I caution all of us not to get too carried away with what we see as good results on paper. Let us be a bit more objective when we look at what we are actually achieving, and let us recognise that social organisations as well as Governments need to be funded. I hope that such organisations in Africa will blossom and move up, as happened in Latin America.

Now we have a regeneration strategy, which is a \"statement of intent\" and a commitment to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a series of meetings and events ... to discuss our approach to regeneration\".</p><p>However, it is not, as it has been billed, a policy statement; rather it is, as the minister said, the start of a process. No new policies have been laid out, nor have any new plans or real actions that can be pinned down. The statement is all a bit amorphous and insubstantial. It says things such as,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We aim to lay down a framework for our future action\".</p><p>An action plan, in fact, is due later this year. That is all, despite a ministerial group having met for the past two years.</p><p>We do, however, have new terminology. We now have \"mixed ... communities\", which have taken over from balanced communities. I am still waiting for a minister to tell me what the heck a balanced community is. The Executive never defined it, so it has changed it. This time we are not having a steering group, a consultative panel, a task force or a working group&#8212;we are having a \"sounding board\".</p><p>I have a real concern about the \"People and Place\" document, but that is overshadowed by a greater initiative sickness because there has been initiative upon initiative. The Executive may attempt to convince us that that is joined-up government, but it comes across instead as a confusing and crowded bidding agenda. There is lack of clarity and a waste of resources at Executive and agency levels. On the creation of the two urban regeneration companies, will they have any relationship at all with the pathfinder companies that were announced last year? Is the funding for regeneration additional to the cities growth fund and the vacant and derelict land fund? We hear more and more announcements all the time, but how many measures are delivered? How <place-holder colnum=\"23633\"/> many are completed? What will have to give this time, to allow another measure to go ahead?</p><p>If the proposed policy is actually one of consolidation, the minister should tell us exactly how much new money is being committed by the Government, and how much money is forecast or expected from the private sector. Is the Commonwealth games village in Glasgow included in the policy? Will the minister tell us now or will we, further down the line, have to watch the charade of Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Executive standing up, patting each other on the back and reannouncing money?</p><p>I could talk for ever about housing, but I am running out of time. How often will the 21,500 affordable homes be reannounced? Why are we still encouraging private sector developers and registered social landlords to build for sale or rent in the most deprived areas? As for the idea of demonstration mixed-tenure projects, they have been around for years and years. We do not need any more pilot schemes.</p><p>We have areas of deprivation and we have to address the consequences of market failure in the west of Scotland. That has to be done, but it is to the shame of successive Governments that areas that had heavy industries in the past are still undergoing transition. If the market is structurally tilted against people, and if we cannot make macro-adjustments to the way in which they compete in that market, we are forced to intervene at a micro level. We are forced to put sticking plasters over gaping wounds.

There are an awful lot more volunteers in Scotland than we count, because people volunteer to do things all the time and do not even realise that they are volunteers. However, there are organisations that provide vital public services and need the funding, partnership agreements and compacts that allow them to operate. The Parliament has been in existence for six years and we have talked away about core funding, three-year programmes and the fact that voluntary organisations need the guarantee of continuing funding, but none of that is happening. In May last year, the minister said that core funding was no longer an issue because we were moving on to full cost recovery. When on earth will that happen?</p><p>I am also interested in ProjectScotland, which I mentioned in last year's debate. It is marvellous. The minister said today that ProjectScotland is being focused on less well-off young people. I ask him to tell me how that is happening. Do we have in place something that allows them to go overseas and volunteer for a year even though they do not have the support network to fall back on in a family, a home or some kind of funding? Are we examining the benefit system and finding ways to allow them to achieve such things? I have spoken to young people in Motherwell who would love to go overseas and do international development work but, if they are homeless, on benefit and do not have the support network that much more fortunate young people have, it is just a pipe dream.</p><p>The minister says that, through Jobcentre Plus, we are building up support networks for those who are less well-off to enable them to volunteer.

Although it is true that a sustainable development strategy must be led from the top by example and encouragement, it is sometimes necessary to offer the stick rather than the carrot if we are to ensure that things really happen.</p><p>I believe that the minister and the Executive have a genuine commitment to sustainable development, but I have concerns about the timidity that is inherent in \"Choosing Our Future\". For example, page 8 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We hope these will inspire others to follow suit.\"</p><p>That is fine, but we need action. In the section on procurement on page 80, the document states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Executive needs to show leadership\".</p><p>I agree, but is that a tacit admission that the Executive has not shown leadership already? If such leadership results in no moves forward, what will the Executive do? Hope, inspiration and showing leadership are good things, but they may not be enough to achieve the required changes.</p><p>Despite the absence of targets and detailed steps on how those will be achieved, the strategy document gives an important role to the voluntary sector. A plethora of organisations are mentioned:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Executive will work closely with the Sustainable Scotland Network, Scottish Sustainable Development Forum, Sustainable Development Commission, Forward Scotland and other key stakeholders\".</p><p>I am also aware that the sus it out programme was recently announced at a presentation at Edinburgh castle and that funding is being provided to help civic society to move forward and become engaged with the issue. I am concerned about the lack of a single, coherent voice on this matter, although that concern, which is not just for this minister's department, might be for another day.</p><p>For some time, I have also been concerned that voluntary organisations are becoming so entangled in delivering on Government plans that, instead of Government standing up and being firm about what must happen, those organisations increasingly appear to be little more than one of its arms, delivering services. I look for reassurance that Scotland's voluntary organisations are not being asked to deliver on the Executive's environmental targets. For example, is there a requirement on local authorities to engage with the sus it out campaign? What kind of clout does the campaign have? Does the Executive back what it is trying to achieve?<place-holder colnum=\"22194\"/></p><p>I am also interested in what the strategy has to say about both housing and public buildings. The issue has been discussed before; indeed, the document cites the very good example of the Slateford Green project in Edinburgh, which was built for a housing association and shows what can be achieved. Moreover, excellent long-standing projects in Shettleston and Easterhouse in Glasgow are heated by communal wood-burning facilities. We should move in that direction.</p><p>However, the public sector and other sectors are not doing enough to develop real sustainable housing. By that, I am not simply referring to the eco-housing model; I am talking about smaller projects. For example, housing stock transfer organisations have ordered thousands of sets of uPVC windows. What is wrong with wood? It is more sustainable, and brings us back to the potential for local delivery and employment and the green economy. We should take such matters more into account.</p><p>Alex Johnstone said that initial capital cost was an issue for affordable housing. However, why should capital cost be an issue only for people who cannot afford to buy their own homes or who choose to rent from housing associations, councils or other public sector bodies? The secret is to consider the whole life of these houses. After all, best value is not just a matter of unit cost; as I have said, the whole-life aspects of these buildings must be taken into consideration. I have cited the example of Scandinavia before, and we should examine how those countries deal with and cost their housing.

Progress on the bill was well under way before I became a member of the committee. I am impressed by the work that has been done over nearly five years to try to get the bill right. We must get it right. As Bill Butler said, we are obliged to bring forward a bill to replace the members' interests order.</p><p>The bill relates to the principles on which the Parliament was founded; they are basic principles on which we can all agree. We might disagree about who has the most wisdom&#8212;personally, I think that it is Scottish National Party members. There is, in general, willingness in the Parliament to examine the issues properly and proceed on the basis of evidence that is presented to us.</p><p>We seek justice in many forms&#8212;we may not agree on the best path to deliver it, but at least we already have a firm parliamentary tradition that insists that injustices cannot be swept under the carpet. There is a common desire for the delivery of justice.</p><p>As far as compassion is concerned, each member can look to themselves on that one.</p><p>The principle of integrity is the one that links into what we are doing today at stage 1 of the bill. We must ensure that we are personally and collectively as a Parliament accountable to the electorate and the population. However, the process must be proportionate and workable. That is why I give credit to those who have worked hard on the bill and to those who have responded to requests by committee members to put forward their points of view.</p><p>The issues can be difficult, although some of them are obvious. Bill Butler mentioned paid advocacy. It is obvious that members should not take payment for putting forward points of view in the Parliament. The point about overseas travel is also fairly obvious. Other things are not so obvious, however. When I joined the committee, the prejudice test was being discussed. The issue at the time was one of members having to consider their interests objectively in the light of a perception of gain. Although such perceptions can be actual or guided by others, all of us recognise their importance.</p><p>Nowadays, perceptions are quite often seen as fact. An awful lot of members feel that that is the case and recognise the difficulties in having to deal with them. We have to try very hard to do everything that we can to ensure that perception is not seen as all and that the facts are made available.<place-holder colnum=\"21713\"/></p><p>Responsibility for the issue does not lie only with the members of the Standards and Public Appointments Committee; it is one for all MSPs. It is a good thing that an ad hoc committee is being established for stage 2. It means that members other than those on the Standards and Public Appointments Committee will look at the matter. It is also good that the ad hoc committee will take forward the views that are expressed in today's debate, look at the issues in a brand new light and, following its stage 2 deliberations, bring the matter back to the chamber.</p><p>Members of the ad hoc committee should be given a certain leeway; they should be allowed to be imaginative and not feel that they have to say, \"Oh, we have already agreed the principles&#8212;some of them are set in stone.\" As Bill Butler said, some principles are set in stone under the Scotland Act 1998&#8212;to do with criminal offences, for example&#8212;but we can look again at other things. The committee will bring the bill back to the chamber for all of us to consider again.</p><p>Too often in the Parliament, we just let others get on with things&#8212;I am as guilty of that as the next person&#8212;and then, when something is put down in black and white, we all go, \"Oh, gosh! I didn't realise that that was going to happen,\" and panic ensues. I urge all members to speak to the members of the ad hoc committee about any of their concerns.

I was absolutely stunned by the amount of work that had been packed into those two weeks, by the standard of the work&#8212;some of the projects were extremely detailed&#8212;and by the variation in the work. Most of all, I was struck by the socially inclusive nature of the academy. Young people from all walks of life and from all sorts of schools were taking part in the on-going teamwork. Although the two-week academy could make some academic difference, it was primarily about motivation and confidence building.</p><p>Two things stuck in my mind from that day. First, one of the teams had carried out a healthy eating project and had produced a billboard with \"healthy eating\" on one side and \"unhealthy eating\" on the other. In the middle of the \"unhealthy eating\" side was a big picture of Alex Johnstone stuffing his face with a pie. When I said to the team, \"I know that chap. Do you know who he is?\" they said, \"Oh yes&#8212;he should know better.\" That was why his photograph had been used. I apologise to Alex Johnstone for telling that story, but I have already told him about it, so I hope that that was okay.</p><p>The other thing that stuck with me was much more serious. I got talking to two young girls who had carried out a somewhat forensic project on different elements of the bladder, how people's bodies work and so on. It was complicated and interesting. One young lass said to me that, when they first went to the academy, they thought of leaving immediately because everyone else spoke much better than they did and they felt a bit out of their depth. However, they were amazed to have done better than some of the people who spoke better than them. That is an important issue&#8212;some people in that age group are not confident that they can compete and go on to higher education. In that regard, some of the parents who I spoke to were absolutely delighted that their children were doing so well at the summer academy. They were being motivated to push their children a little more because they had found out what they were capable of.</p><p>Just before the graduation ceremony, there was a concert during which some of the work that had been produced was dramatised. Again, the standard of work was high and it was amazing to think that that had been achieved in two weeks.</p><p>Bill Butler introduced the topic as a good news story&#8212;it certainly is and its benefits should be spread. I understand that this year pupils from 119 schools in 13 local authorities in the west of Scotland attended the academy. I would love to see that rolled out further across Scotland.

I will look back at the 2004 Olympic games. Slovakia, with a population of 5.4 million, had 35 competitors. Ireland, with a population of 4 million, had 48 competitors. Finland's population is 5.2 million and it had 53 competitors. Denmark's population is 5.4 million and it had 92 competitors. Scotland's population is 5 million and it had 22 competitors. Ireland had more than double the number of competitors that we had, although its population is <place-holder colnum=\"19823\"/> 1 million lower than ours. How on earth does that encourage our young Scottish athletes to aspire to greatness?</p><p>I still fail to understand why even to consider the option is such a problem.

It covers television, classical drama, opera, folk and traditional music, jazz, dancing and ballet. It is difficult to define what culture is: one person's idea of culture might be another person's idea of absolute horror if they had to sit through it for a couple of hours.</p><p>The Cultural Commission put in a lot of hard work&#8212;and, gosh, what a huge document it came up with&#8212;to try to define culture and somehow to create a route map to reach that destination. Culture is something to which everyone seems to <place-holder colnum=\"19448\"/> aspire&#8212;every man, woman and child in the country will apparently be rejoicing in their love of and participation in culture. I am not all that convinced that that is realistic, admirable intention though it is. I am also not convinced that we can be too prescriptive about culture&#8212;telling people what they will learn to enjoy. I remain to be convinced that legislating for cultural rights will take us beyond the initial euphoria of saying that everyone has a right to culture. Nevertheless, I remain open minded.</p><p>The role of government, both national and local, is to ensure access to cultural activities of varying kinds, as well as to ensure that awareness is raised of the different aspects of what we call culture. There might well be a lot of people out there who would enjoy certain things but never get the chance to participate in them or to see whether they like them. One of the keys to that, which comes out strongly in the commission's report, is the education system, which is where we should begin. I like the idea of a permanent, nationally consistent culture co-ordinators scheme. Christine May talked about Fife in that respect. Some of the cultural co-ordinators that we have had have done a great job in raising awareness among schoolchildren of the potential for performing and for just enjoying.</p><p>Schools are doing a lot just now&#8212;some teachers are doing an awful lot&#8212;as are our national companies. A primary school in East Kilbride has Scottish Opera come along every year. I am privileged to have gone along a couple of time to see the sterling work that Scottish Opera does in communities, which does not often get mentioned.</p><p>The issue is about taking culture&#8212;I am starting to dislike using the word&#8212;or the arts into schools and letting people see the opportunities for participation and enjoyment. However, it is also about ensuring that schoolchildren are taken out of school, whether as part of curricular or extracurricular activities, to all different forms of culture. That might involve visiting Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, which I did many times when I was at school&#8212;I know that other members did, too&#8212;visiting the national museums to see the national collections or learning how to use libraries. All those things start to form children's views of culture.</p><p>Recommendation 11 in the education section, on page 76 of the report, asks</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That a national strategy for educational materials, visits and experiences supported by companies and institutions across Scotland and co-ordinated by Learning Teaching Scotland be developed.\"</p><p>That is sound reasoning and logic and we can move forward with it.<place-holder colnum=\"19449\"/></p><p>Local authorities have a big role to play.

I believe that if the Executive went to the people now and asked whether they thought that it was acceptable that that was going on, and told them that the Executive could do nothing about it, people would vote very differently for who was governing their country.</p><p>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton mentioned the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. I have been asking for years what the Executive has been doing to ensure that the Home Office complies with the terms of the 1995 act. The answer that I get is: \"It's the Home Office's responsibility. It's nothing to do with us.\" I do not believe that for a minute. The law that applies in this country under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 applies to every single child in this country. Is the Executive really saying that there is a little piece of Scotland&#8212;wherever an asylum-seeker family happens to be&#8212;that is not Scotland and over which the Executive therefore has no jurisdiction? If that is the case, the Executive had better think again about what kind of Government it is running.</p><p>Many have gone on about Christine Grahame and her decision to abstain from voting on the Executive amendment. I completely agree with her on abstaining, because the Executive has been abstaining for years from any responsibility. Let us consider what the Executive is saying in the amendment. It is saying that it will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"continue discussions ... with a view to agreement that the Home Office will work closely with services for children and young people before ... removal\".<place-holder colnum=\"19391\"/></p><p>What is that? That is nothing. That is no more than the Executive trying to dig itself out of the hole that it has been put in by the strength of public opinion on the issue. I will tell the Executive what it should do: it should take a stand. It should say to the ministers in the Home Office, and all ministers at Westminster: \"It's not happening here. We're not doing it.\" The Executive should use the Vucaj family as the benchmark and tell the ministers: \"They're not going anywhere. They're staying here, because they are part of our country.

Although the United Nations' human development reports update the eight millennium development goals annually, only one of those goals relates directly to the economy and it is about strengthening partnerships between poor countries and rich countries.</p><p>I looked at what the European Commission has been saying. The Lisbon European Council developed a set of structural indicators that are designed to measure progress towards the <place-holder colnum=\"19358\"/> European Union's goal, which is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.\"</p><p>That is the key.

The Sustainable Development Commission has welcomed the UK Government's commitment to deliver new indicators to measure the nation's well-being. The commission is right to say that we need a radically different approach to measuring economic progress, because environmental and social goals should be included and jobs should be safeguarded. Income and GDP should not be the sole components of a nation's happiness. We all know that good health, stable families, meaningful work, secure neighbourhoods and strong communities are all vital components of personal and collective well-being.</p><p>The UK Government Cabinet Office has examined a study on life satisfaction as an example of an indicator of sustainable development. That works on the concept that increases in GDP&#8212;the traditional indicator&#8212;do not necessarily lead to greater quality of life for citizens. The Executive's amendment says that growing the economy is a top priority. I suggest that the population's well-being should be the top priority. Such matters can be considered in tandem. In the report that the UK Cabinet Office has considered, economic growth&#8212;if measured as GDP&#8212;looks good and shows a steady rise from 1970 to 1997. However, the life satisfaction figures are static. People are not necessarily happier and do not feel a greater sense of well-being just because the GDP happens to look good.

I read the report with interest and some disquiet.</p><p>Sarah Boyack quoted the stark warning from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which is on page 1 of the report. It is worth restating:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If we go for business as usual ... we are destined for something unimaginable.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Environment and Rural Affairs Committee</em>, 26 January 2005; c 1545.]</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham showed how some people have already faced the unimaginable horror of what climate change can do.</p><p>However, it is not all horror. The next paragraph of the committee's report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A massive possibility for change exists at government, business and individual levels, given the right policy levers and leadership.\"</p><p>I urge the Scottish Executive to promote that possibility for change. It should start from the top&#8212;the Government&#8212;and work down to business and individuals. It should use the right policy levers and show leadership.</p><p>The committee and many knowledgeable commentators have pushed for a national target that will allow for sectoral objectives and a strategy to achieve them. As WWF Scotland says in its commentary on the report:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Executive's response\"</p><p>is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that they are still very much against the key measure&#8212;an overall climate change target for Scotland.\"</p><p>I do not understand why that is the case. WWF Scotland says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Without this demonstration of political will Scotland is bound to fail to make an equal contribution to the UK's Kyoto Protocol target of a 12.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2008-2012.\"</p><p>As Sarah Boyack said, the issue is not only about Scotland; it is not only about our sitting here wondering how climate change affects us. Everything that the developed world does has knock-on effects on people in poorer countries. We have already seen the awful effects that there can be, but things will get worse.</p><p>I was interested in what Maureen Macmillan said about the many things that can be done. Many small initiatives could do with support from the Government at the top. In asking for a route map, she reflected what the Environment and Rural Development Committee's report states. On page 63, the report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"At all levels individual citizens and business people need a route map for how we can move towards a carbon-free world. High level government action is clearly required in many policy areas.\"<place-holder colnum=\"19287\"/></p><p>It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there are many ways in which significant contributions ... can be achieved by individuals (with little cost to the public purse) if they are effectively engaged in the process.\"</p><p>Being \"effectively engaged\" is the key. As the Scottish Parliament information centre briefing note states, in our country,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"none of this is new&#8212;most people understand the messages that increased energy use and consumption are bad ... but the key is making it easier for them to make more sustainable choices.\"</p><p>That is where radical leadership is required. In paragraph after paragraph, the committee's report urges radical action from the top to encourage everyone else. Some solutions may be difficult for people to implement, but the Government's job is to make decisions about what is necessary for the greater good.</p><p>The report is important and could be the key to the way forward. However, there is not enough time to discuss the implications and potential solutions that are noted in it. Members have called for much greater debate and discussion, which I, too, would welcome. The Executive's response has been somewhat disappointing in the light of the report's radical nature, but the response does not have to be disappointing.

The housing improvement task force must be praised for the amount of detailed evidence that it considered in forming its view on how we should proceed with Scotland's housing.</p><p>As is reflected in the committee's report, one of the most important things about the bill is the significance of the culture change that will be required of owners to allow the legislation to be used in the intended spirit and to make a real difference in Scotland's private sector housing. It is important to have information campaigns and monitoring processes in place so that we can ensure that the legislation is acted on.<place-holder colnum=\"18396\"/></p><p>We also have to consider this country's view of the private landlord. Not all private landlords are bad; there some very good examples of private renting in this country. Of course, we always hear about the bad private landlords&#8212;indeed, in my career, I have had experience of extremely bad ones. There is a problem that must be addressed.</p><p>The citizens advice bureaux said in evidence to the committee that, in the past year, one in every 10 issues brought to their network was about housing. That amounted to 43,000 housing cases, of which 4,600 related to problems with housing conditions. I do not have the figures, but I can almost guarantee that most of those problems would have been with private sector housing.</p><p>As the minister said, it is estimated that there is &#163;5 billion-worth of disrepair in the private sector. That problem must be addressed. We have made progress since the late 1970s and 1980s, when housing action areas and housing associations came on to the scene to address the major problems in tenemental housing&#8212;at the time, some people were living in real slums. We have moved on from then, but we still have slums, albeit of a different type. We have to deal with problems such as dampness in houses that were built by the public sector in our inner cities and peripheral estates.</p><p>A new issue has arisen in the private rented sector since the introduction of the right to buy. We all know that, as the minister said, some people who exercise their right to buy either do not take on board or do not receive the information that will enable them to recognise that they have obligations towards their properties. That is also the case when such houses are privately let. Where I live in the East Kilbride constituency, there is a big issue around the private rented sector in ex-right-to-buy houses.</p><p>That leads me on to local authorities, how they have to deal with the problems, their powers and the implementation of this far-sighted legislation. One of the worries expressed by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and by Edinburgh, Glasgow and other councils concerned the financial and human resources that are available to them to deal with the new legislation. In the past few years, the Parliament and the Executive have placed an awful lot of new obligations on local authorities, under the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, for example. I am concerned that we are not providing sufficient resources to ensure that all that well-intentioned legislation is properly implemented.</p><p>One strategic housing function relates to the change from housing action areas to housing renewal areas, which is to be welcomed. However, there are issues about resourcing. Local <place-holder colnum=\"18397\"/> authorities will have to be fairly proactive if the bill is to be properly implemented. That is the only way in which big strides can be made in improving our housing stock.</p><p>The tolerable standard will be slightly upgraded. I will not talk much about that, except to say that the committee heard a lot of evidence that, as part of the tolerable standard, it would be better to consider a satisfactory level of thermal performance rather than thermal insulation. I will leave my colleague Rob Gibson to talk about that.</p><p>Rob Gibson will also discuss remote and rural areas, where the private rented sector is a huge issue. There is a problem with getting tradesmen to carry out the work identified and required by local authorities. We also need to consider whether it is possible to carry out such work in some of the building forms and styles in rural areas. The committee was reminded of some of the constraints that agencies such as Historic Scotland put on owners who wish to do up historic properties.</p><p>We generally welcome the revisions to the repairing standard. However, the committee and others recognised the need to strike the right balance and to achieve improvements in the private rented sector without that having a detrimental effect on the supply of houses in that sector. We do not want to say to landlords, \"This is going to be so difficult for you that it is not worth your while, so just sell your property and move on.\" The private rented sector is a necessary part of the overall housing picture in this country.</p><p>I was heartened by the minister's response to what the committee said about disability issues, about which Sandra White will speak in greater detail. I am interested in the intention to consider ring fencing funding. The committee did a good job on that issue and I am glad that the Executive has taken on board what we said. It is obvious that rights for disabled people in social or private rented sector housing have not been properly addressed in relation to the operation of adaptation grants, for example. This is our chance to get the system right and to move forward towards having equal access to housing for everyone in our society.</p><p>I know that I am running out of time, but I want to mention the single survey. Of course, my party welcomes the proposal&#8212;it was our policy&#8212;but the issue must be explored in more detail. As I listened to evidence, I became more sceptical, although I have not changed my view that the survey is the only way forward. However, there is a bit more work to do. The pilot scheme did not work very well&#8212;there is no point in going into all the possible reasons for that now&#8212;so the issue has to be considered again. There are also issues to be investigated about costs.<place-holder colnum=\"18398\"/></p><p>On right-to-buy properties, I am still of the view that they should not be exempt from the bill's provisions, especially if we are seeking to standardise procedures. We have all heard horror stories from our areas of people buying their property under the right to buy only to find out later that the property is defective. Similarly, two or three owners down the line, people who have paid market value for their property sometimes find out that their property is defective. If we are seeking to effect a true culture change in the way in which houses are purchased and sold in this country, everyone should be on a level playing field.</p><p>I conclude by noting the committee's recommendation on national guidance and local flexibility, which was an issue that came through at various points of our stage 1 consideration. It was important that the minister echoed our recommendation in his opening remarks. Local authorities need to be able to look to national guidance to help them to implement strategies for their areas, but we need local flexibility, because it is clear that our country's communities are varied and that there are different housing needs in different places. That brings me back to where I started. If national guidance is to be adapted for local communities, resources&#8212;finance and workers&#8212;will be necessary. I ask the minister to take on board the issue of funding.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13343592", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Of course the Scottish National Party welcomes the bill as one of many pieces of housing legislation that have been passed since the Parliament began in 1999.

It gives me the opportunity to speak yet again, as I have done over the past few years, about a group of people who feel that they have been let down by the excellent practices that have come in with \"The same as you?\" I am referring to the elderly carers of adults with learning disabilities, some of whom are in the public gallery tonight. As I have said before and will continue to say, the very good intentions of \"The same as you?\" cannot be denied. However, there have been losers: the people who have cared for their sons and daughters for up to 50 years and who, to be honest, just need a break. Caring for young adults with learning disabilities is exhausting.</p><p>Although I could talk about the lack of respite care, which is an issue in this regard, the main issue for those people&#8212;I can talk about the Murray Owen carers group in East Kilbride&#8212;is straightforward. All that they want is for their sons and daughters to be settled and adequately looked after before their mums&#8212;it is usually women&#8212;and fathers, in some cases, can no longer look after them or, indeed, are just not there to look after them any more.</p><p>Quite a few carers say that help is provided only when things reach crisis point. I cannot think of a crisis that could be worse for someone with an intellectual disability than to come home from their learning centre one day and find that their mam is no longer there. That is often the time at which social work steps in, which means that the first real care is given when someone with an intellectual disability finds that the person who has looked after them all their life is no longer there. That is a terrible thing to put someone through. It is also a terrible thing that we have elderly carers, some of whom are over 80 and yet are looking after big hulking men and women who require physical help and mental stimulation.<place-holder colnum=\"18146\"/></p><p>There is a wonderful United Kingdom study, which was carried out by Jane Hubert and Sheila Hollins. It focuses on people with intellectual disabilities and their elderly carers and explores some basic questions about physical difficulties. The study asks how a woman of 75 can be expected to ensure that her son of 50 has a bath or a shower every morning before he goes to his learning centre. Every day is a brand new day. If the son does not want to get into the bath, how can his mother be expected to cope?</p><p>Mental health issues are also involved. Sheila Hollins says:</p><p>\"Psychiatric disorders, including depression, affective disorders, anxiety disorders and delusional disorders, are more frequent among elderly people with intellectual disabilities than among the general elderly population.\"</p><p>We all know that people with some forms of learning disability age quicker and that dementia can set in at a much younger age. We are leaving elderly people to cope with that.</p><p>Many carers feel that they are not getting help from anywhere. For example, South Lanarkshire Council refused point-blank to meet me to discuss the issue, even though I wanted to represent about a dozen families. We must talk about the issues and get things sorted for those people. I am sure that Jeannette Kelly, who is vocal about the issue, will not mind my saying that we have been talking about the issue for three or four years, during which Jeannette has not got any younger; she is getting less able to cope all the time. Surely we can find a way of ensuring that Jeannette's daughter, Vanessa, is settled somewhere safe where she feels happy and content before Jeannette is no longer able to look after her.</p><p>I have asked ministers before to meet me on the issue, on which I have genuine concerns, but that has not happened.

I decided to listen to what was said and comment on it&#8212;I suppose we could call this a closing speech halfway through the debate, so I apologise to Stewart Maxwell.</p><p>The first thing that I noted was that the minister was at pains to emphasise his point about a culture of respect and responsibility. It is right that we have to cultivate self-respect and personal responsibility, but what seems to be missing from the debate is the point that everyone should respect what other people decide to do with their lives. A culture of respect should work both ways.</p><p>A few members have mentioned choices. If people are making informed choices, which I believe should be the central tenet of any sexual health and relationship strategy, society should respect those choices, as long as their exercise is not harming or oppressing anyone else physically or mentally. I would like there to be more emphasis on mutual respect for people and their choices.</p><p>I was interested in the progress that the minister was talking about and the stakeholder events that were held in February and March. I was also interested to hear that the health boards have now submitted their clinical service plans. However, I am concerned about the need for additional specialists in the field and the fact that that need might not be met in all areas of Scotland. Some of my constituents talked to me recently about the lack of sexual health services in Lanarkshire and about their inability to be very vocal about that because of embarrassment about speaking out about such matters.</p><p>I am glad to hear that the health boards will have executive leadership. I am also glad that the national sexual health advisory committee has now been formed. I noted that it is going to be a group of stakeholders, and I looked at the membership published in the press release. Is <place-holder colnum=\"17951\"/> there any room on that committee or on any of its sub-groups for people from civic Scotland and the voluntary sector in this field? I do not necessarily mean those who run Caledonia Youth or other services; I mean people with direct experience of using such services. Recently, I was on a radio programme talking about sexual health. There were two young girls on the programme, one of whom was a teenage mum and one of whom was not because she had exercised her choice for contraception. I was so impressed at the sense that was spoken by those two young girls and I wonder whether the minister agrees that there is room for that kind of representation on the committee or on one of the sub-groups. The minister said that he talked to young people when he was formulating plans for the committee so I am pretty certain that he will have picked up on that and I hope that he will think about it.</p><p>It is excellent that the minister has decided to chair the committee himself. That is a mark of its importance. I know that we are five or six years on from when the need for a sexual health strategy was first mooted and there are concerns about that. However, we are where we are and we should move forward.</p><p>Shona Robison mentioned the social aspects of the issue. That bring us back to the need for joined-up government. As Fiona Hyslop mentioned, we need to ensure that there is cross-departmental working on the issue with the Minister for Education and Young People, Peter Peacock. The social aspects involve low self-esteem and lack of choice and aspiration, especially among young women in some areas. Those are huge issues. Again, I hope that our social policy will reflect the needs that are highlighted as the sexual health strategy advances.</p><p>On the Tory amendment, I agree with Mike Rumbles&#8212;much though it goes against the grain to say so&#8212;in that I am concerned about the suggestion that we should have no national sexual health advisory committee and that we should publicly affirm the primary responsibility of parents.

Like many people in the SNP, I decided some time ago that Norway was the kind of nation that I wanted Scotland to be. Norway is independent, humanitarian and its citizens are respected throughout the world, often by the least advantaged people and communities. When I was in East Timor in 1999, I found that Norway and the other Scandinavian countries were much respected by the people there. Unlike the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and other countries, Norway was not seen as part of the problem&#8212;Norwegians were seen as helping East Timor to attain its freedom and justice for its people. Therefore, I hugely admire Norway.</p><p>In particular, I admire Norway's international development work. For the past 50 years, it has been a prime mover in international development co-operation and a major donor. Alex Neil mentioned the fact that Norway's contributions as a proportion of its gross national product already exceed the UN's recommendation. As a result, it is unlike Scotland which, as part of the UK&#8212;John Swinney mentioned this earlier&#8212;is nowhere near meeting the UN's recommendation. In fact, we have short-changed the developing world over the past 35 years by &#163;76 billion and the figure will rise until we match the recommendation.</p><p>Norway introduced duty-free and quota-free access to its domestic market for all goods&#8212;except weapons&#8212;from the least developed countries. It has an active debt relief policy and there is the Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries. The Norwegian Government considers it important that Norwegian policy does not hamper efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries and it regularly undertakes reviews of all its policies so that they can be adjusted, if necessary. I want my nation to aspire to that and match such efforts.</p><p>Norway makes a major contribution to UN operations, particularly on peacekeeping. We have all heard of the Oslo accords and Norway's work <place-holder colnum=\"17727\"/> on the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. It has continued with that work despite the many setbacks that there have been in that region. Norway and her Scandinavian partners have also developed the concept of a civilian peace force, which I would dearly love to be developed in Scotland. Civilian rather than military input to mediation and conflict resolution has much to offer.</p><p>As I said, I want Scotland to be a nation like Norway.

In the past, contractual and conditional approaches were tried, and failed. What we are suggesting is a new kind of development, based on mutual respect and solidarity, and rooted in a sound analysis of what actually works. This can speed up progress, building on recent positive developments in Africa, towards a just world of which Africa is an integral part.\"</p><p>The most important of several extremely important statements in that conclusion is the reference to \"mutual respect and solidarity\". We should not treat Africa as a charity case. Africans are equal partners&#8212;if not the more important partners&#8212;in the project to advance their continent. However, it is not all one-sided. After all, the developed world has a powerful self-interest and moral duty with regard to this matter.</p><p>Actions are required on both sides. For a start, donors must support African countries' priorities instead of imposing their own pet or special <place-holder colnum=\"17683\"/> interest projects on them. Some countries must broaden the participation of citizens, improve accountability and, in some cases, root out corruption. Donors must back up their promises with action and funds, dismantle trade barriers and address unfair agricultural practices. African countries themselves must reform bureaucracy, both internally and across the continent, and simplify their trade tariff systems.</p><p>Another important aspect of the Commission for Africa's conclusion is the reference to aid that is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"rooted in a sound analysis of what actually works\".</p><p>Poverty is not, and should not be, an industry and aid should not be a method of levering in influence. Aid and debt relief have led to success stories, which should be celebrated. For example, Tanzania, which is one of six countries to have completed the current debt relief programme, received $3 billion in debt relief. Almost overnight, an estimated 1.6 million children returned to school. In Uganda, the level of debt service payments has dropped and the number of young children attending school has increased from 2.3 million in 1997 to 6.5 million now, which means that enrolment has more than doubled to 94 per cent.</p><p>In Mozambique, as a result of debt relief, 500,000 children are being vaccinated against tetanus, whooping cough and diphtheria. Finally, in Cameroon, a comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy was launched with help from debt savings. There are good examples of African Governments and people moving forward&#8212;it is not all bad news.</p><p>There have been some really good developments between Scotland and Africa. I have been particularly impressed by a University of Dundee distance learning programme that has benefited Eritrea and Kenya by training nurses to a level at which they can work in their communities. As a result, the nurses are not tempted to move away and work in the UK and other western nations.</p><p>I am a great believer in training women, particularly those with children, because they stay in their communities and can contribute to capacity building and good aid projects until it is valid for other countries to give direct aid to those Governments. At that point, the systems are in place to ensure that people are really empowered. For example, the Department for International Development used to fund small projects on the ground in Tanzania. However, at the moment, aid goes directly to the Tanzanian Government because there is transparency and it is clear that the aid is being dispersed to the people. We must learn from successful African projects and consider similar approaches.<place-holder colnum=\"17684\"/></p><p>I started off by talking about a new way of thinking in relation to sub-Saharan Africa. However, Africa is part of a wider world and there are still huge problems elsewhere, such as poverty, lack of trade justice and conflict. In fact, there is more conflict than ever before and that conflict now directly impacts more on civilians than on the military. Kofi Annan estimates that nine out of 10 casualties of conflict are civilians. Many of those problems are exacerbated, if not caused, by the G8 countries and their allies. I am thinking of trade barriers, wars, turning away when it suits our interests and the arms trade, particularly the small arms trade, which is particularly relevant to the African situation.</p><p>One of my hopes is that the aspiration to create a new way of thinking, which was voiced by the Commission for Africa, will inform the countries of the G8, who will spread that new way of thinking across the world and that that will have an effect on the way in which nations interact and make progress. That new way of thinking is long overdue and I believe that, if the G8 summit produces tangible results in terms of a new way forward for the world, people in Scotland will be glad that the summit was held in this country.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13341720", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Time for Reflection: G8"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have been told that the Commission for Africa report will be used to inform the G8 discussion.

No harm to any of us, but I thought, \"There was the youth of our country and they must have been bored witless sitting up there listening to us talking.\" I hope that that does not put them off seeing what happens at the youth congress in August. I see that more people are now leaving&#8212;perhaps that is because I got up to speak. It is difficult for folk in our age groups to say things that are meaningful to youth, although that does not mean that we should stop trying.</p><p>In his opening speech the minister mentioned individuals from different countries, which gives me the opportunity to mention something that I think is wonderful: a couple of the delegates at the <place-holder colnum=\"17197\"/> youth conference will be from East Timor&#8212;the world's newest nation, which has just entered its fourth year of independence. That is particularly special, because in such countries young people have suffered badly and have been political from a young age and aware of all sorts of issues of which children in our society are not aware. It is marvellous that we are welcoming young people from all over the world, from different circumstances and societies. The opportunity for the 120 delegates from the UK to learn from their experiences is immense.</p><p>We hear all the time that young people are not interested in politics, given the lack of voting among the young. However, I believe that, as others have said, it is party politics that they are not interested in&#8212;which perhaps goes back to how I began my speech. With the rise of internet communication, we have seen young people get involved in issue politics. The millennium development goals, international development and aid have captured young people's imagination and young people are running with them. I am convinced that if the youth congress in Hawaii in 1999 had set the millennium development goals and been given the action plan for them, we would not be sitting here a third of the way in saying, \"We're never going to meet the targets in 2015,\" which we are not.</p><p>The enthusiasm that young people have, coupled with their lack of disillusionment, which sets in when people get older, means that they will just get on and do things. We hear people saying that certain things are impossible, or that certain amounts of money cannot be raised, but that is not true. We should listen more to young people, who have enthusiasm and take what we might sometimes call simplistic approaches, because they would get things done. As somebody said at the Commission for Africa conference last week, we managed to raise billions of pounds to go to war with Iraq pretty blooming quickly, so how come we cannot raise the money that is needed to lift Africa out of poverty?</p><p>I was interested in Lord James Douglas-Hamilton's speech for reasons other than what he had to say about fair trade. Perhaps I am being disingenuous, but might I interpret his call for nations to take control of their aid budgets as being an indication that Lord James is joining the recent moves of some Tories towards independence? Certainly, Scotland could take control of its aid budget. Even within the devolved settlement, Scotland could have control of its aid budget and make a contribution above that which has been committed by the Executive.</p><p>Sylvia Jackson said that she was at a Baptist church on Sunday. It must have been a Baptist weekend, because I was at a Baptist church on <place-holder colnum=\"17198\"/> Sunday as well. She said that the role of the churches in joint action on issues such as the millennium development goals and in encouraging initiatives such as the youth congress is huge. Regardless of whether one is religious, one must accept that the role that the churches play is fantastic. A lot of young people work in churches. The youth group of one of the churches in Strathaven, where I live, does tremendous work in its partnerships with Ethiopia in relation to international development and&#8212;due to Strathaven being Scotland's first fair trade town&#8212;fair trade.</p><p>Jamie Stone mentioned the recognition of world events by young people. This year, South Lanarkshire Council hosted the national Holocaust memorial and remembrance ceremonies. I was taken by the fact that almost everyone who presented at the various events that the council held was a young person. Everything was extremely well done. The level of understanding and compassion of the youth of South Lanarkshire that was evident at those events was amazing. I can see Michael McMahon nodding. He attended many of the events and, evidently, he felt the same as I did.</p><p>Last week, during the debate on the voluntary sector, I said that the Executive's intention with regard to project Scotland is admirable, in that the project makes it easier for young people to do voluntary work and get involved in their communities. I would like the remit of project Scotland to be extended to include partnerships with people overseas. As has been mentioned, we are now building a partnership with Malawi, which is great. However, would it not also be great if we could use project Scotland to help young people from Scotland to go to Malawi to work on various projects there? I think that Elaine Murray said that our young people are the leaders and policy makers of the future and we should encourage them to volunteer in the way that I have described.</p><p>The motion says that the Parliament</p><p class=\"indent\">\"welcomes the opportunity that the congress brings to promote Scotland on the international stage.\"</p><p>Of course that is to be welcomed, but the congress is also about what Scotland can give back to the world. Scotland could do a lot on the international stage in a fairly straightforward manner. The minister mentioned eastern Europe and conflict resolution and I would point out that Scotland has already been the setting for conflict resolution meetings for the nations in the Caucasus. In that regard, it is interesting to note that Peace Child International is helping to facilitate the congress. It would be wonderful if, while the congress was going on, we could consider the establishment of a centre for peace and conflict resolution in Scotland. After all, as John Hume said when he retired from the <place-holder colnum=\"17199\"/> European Parliament, there should be a European centre for peace. We should use the youth congress to make a bid for that centre to be housed in Scotland. I cannot think of a better way of promoting Scotland on the international stage.</p><p>I want to mention the G8 summit&#8212;as other members have&#8212;which will take place prior to the youth congress. Bob Geldof issued a challenge to the First Minister at last week's Commission for Africa conference. He said that if world leaders will not change their attitudes before coming to Scotland, they should be told not to bother coming. I do not agree with that. If we try right up until the last second, they just might change their minds. However, the First Minister, backed up by the Parliament and the people of Scotland, should give leaders a hard time while they are here. They should be told that they can and should make changes. We should try to force the hand of everyone who is motivated to act and get something done. That would be a wonderful thing for Scotland to do before the youth congress and would give the congress a boost in progressing its aim of achieving the millennium development goals.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340588", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World Youth Congress"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "A short while ago, I looked up to see that the youngsters who had been sitting in the gallery were leaving.

Although I will move the SNP amendment, I will also be consensual; there is nothing in the Executive's motion with which the SNP disagrees.</p><p>We are discussing a huge sector and I appreciated the minister's comments about how we can have a debate such as this without its sounding cuddly. We have to recognise the importance of the social economy to the general economy of the country. After all, according to Communities Scotland&#8212;which heads up futurebuilders Scotland&#8212;the social economy is worth about &#163;2.2 billion to the Scottish economy and employs about 100,000 people. It also involves 700,000 volunteers in more than 50,000 organisations.</p><p>One issue is that we must recognise what the social economy is. The Executive has acknowledged that by feeling the need to clarify in its motion the contribution that the voluntary sector and the social economy make. Folk in the voluntary sector sometimes do not recognise themselves as being part of the social economy, which is a measure of how diverse the voluntary sector is. The sector ranges from the one person who helps out in a buddy scheme as a befriender or who cares for someone, to the people who work in social enterprises.<place-holder colnum=\"17081\"/></p><p>Social enterprises often emerge from the traditional voluntary sector and often share the values and some of the characteristics of voluntary organisations, but there is a difference between the two. Social enterprises are different from traditional voluntary work and small-scale voluntary organisations because, as is stated by the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition, social enterprise is about the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"integration of business aims, methodologies and behaviours into their organisations\"</p><p>and social enterprises seek to create profits that are ploughed back in to communities. Not all voluntary organisations look to create profit: the raison d'&#234;tre of some is to provide services, so profit does not come into it.</p><p>The Executive's motion mentions quite a few good on-going initiatives, such as futurebuilders Scotland. I have followed the futurebuilders strategy and I ask the minister to say how progress is going, because it seems to me that futurebuilders got off the ground a bit more slowly than was intended. At first it was said that it would run from 2004 to 2006, but now everyone is talking about 2007. Will futurebuilders go beyond that? Key aspects of making such initiatives work are their development and their sustainability. Too often, initiatives are stopped before their full value becomes apparent.</p><p>One of the main aims of futurebuilders is regeneration of disadvantaged areas. I am concerned that we are not placing enough emphasis on people and that we are not giving sufficient recognition to the fact that many smaller voluntary organisations that are not social enterprises contribute to regeneration throughout the country by operating in the voluntary sector and by making quality of life better for many people in terms of their physical, mental and emotional health. I suggest that that leads to the ability to create wealth. If health is not included in such measures to start with, communities will not be able to move on and create wealth.</p><p>As I said, I would appreciate a statement about how the futurebuilders Scotland investment is progressing. I know that the first stage of applications for the first range of projects has now closed. When will the process be opened up again for stage two?</p><p>The volunteering strategy is also mentioned in the motion. We are talking about social enterprises, but they start with volunteers. I was interested to read a submission from Community Enterprise in Strathclyde. Although we hear good things from Communities Scotland and have heard good things from the minister today, there is still scepticism about how futurebuilders is working. Community Enterprise states:<place-holder colnum=\"17082\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"It has become, almost by default, yet another time-limited grant scheme that will no doubt support some interesting organisations and activities, but will not shift either the social economy or the public sector very far towards embracing a culture of investment instead of dependency.\"</p><p>I would appreciate the minister's views on that, because obviously not everyone in the sector is convinced by what is happening.</p><p>Project Scotland is a good idea. We always welcome initiatives that help young people to become involved in their communities. I hope that the initiative will be expanded into other areas in which the Executive is involved. When I read the press release about the scheme, I wondered whether projects could be tied in with our international strategy in order to allow our young people to find out what life is like on the other side of the world. Let us use the Scotland-Malawi partnership that we are all talking about to help people in both places.</p><p>The Executive is talking about allowing volunteers who are on placements to continue to receive benefits. That is important, but we could go further. The reality is that most people who take up voluntary placements can do so with the comfort of knowing that when they come home they can slot back into their job, family or support network. It is difficult for a person who is homeless and who has no support network to go away to volunteer and then come back. I ask the Executive to address that, too.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340401", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector and the Social Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I admire the minister's attempt to display psychic ability, but I have to say that she got it wrong.

The debt of gratitude that we owe to all the veterans who served their country in world war two is immense. I am pleased that we are having this debate to record that gratitude again in the <em>Official Report </em>and to give the recognition mentioned by the minister not only to the individuals but to the organisations that assist veterans and work tirelessly on their behalf.</p><p>I was interested to hear about the on-going programme of veteran-related work, because it is true that there are still difficulties with perceptions of neglect and, in some cases, actual neglect. For example, the ex-personnel of Christmas island have an on-going campaign and of course there are on-going debates about gulf war syndrome.</p><p>All the contributions have been extremely interesting, as have some of the personal stories that we heard. Christine Grahame talked about a friend of her father's and about Mark Hirst's grandfather, and Karen Whitefield talked about a member of her family who was directly involved. Those personal stories bring home the absolute horror of war when we sit and listen to them. Jamie Stone asked how we can bring it home to children, and when he said that I thought back to my own childhood.</p><p>I was born in the mid-1950s and I did not really have a conception of what war was about. I remember&#8212;in fact, it is one of my earliest memories&#8212;sitting and watching a television programme that those of my age group and older will remember. It was called \"All Our Yesterdays\". I can tell by Johann Lamont's smile that she remembers it. It featured stark black-and-white figures who talked about the war, and there was a clipped BBC-pronunciation presenter&#8212;whenever I listen to James Douglas-Hamilton, I remember that TV programme. It was like stories that did not quite seem real. It did not really touch us at all. I was interested in what Carolyn Leckie said about the war poets, because I had to study them at school. I am not a great poetry lover, but there was one poem that made me think for the first time about war in a different way from all the glory stuff that we often heard about. I think that it was by Wilfred Owen. I cannot remember the name of the poem, but I have never forgotten the first line, the <place-holder colnum=\"16881\"/> first three words of which were, \"Our brains ache\". That was a powerful image to me as an adolescent, thinking of that level of pain.</p><p>One thing that I learned when I started reading about the war was that the second world war was a very, very just war, because it had a concrete reason for people going to fight an enemy. That enemy was the offensive politics moving across Europe at that time. The second world war was, of course, preceded by the Spanish civil war and the contributions that were made by the international brigades, from our country and others, in the Spanish civil war have to be recognised as well. Irene Oldfather is right to say that we have to guard against that happening again, because these things are still there in Europe. Whatever problems anybody has with the European Union, at least by having it we are recognising where these things are growing and we are able to take action to fight against them.</p><p>Karen Whitefield, Andrew Welsh and John Swinburne spoke about the efforts that everyone made during the war. Everyone who is involved in war makes some sort of effort.</p><p>I pay tribute to the foreign nationals who were interned during the war in the north of Ireland, the Isle of Man and Orkney, the majority of whom were Italians. I am talking not about those who went on to be deported but those who came back home to their own families and communities in Scotland during the war. They contributed to the war effort of the entire civilian population because they felt that they were in it for Scotland and were fighting against the same enemy against which the rest of the country was fighting.</p><p>Donald Gorrie mentioned the United Nations, which grew out of the League of Nations after the second world war. As Irene Oldfather said in relation to the European Union, international organisations that preserve partnerships between nations are vital and must be kept. We can talk about the corruption that exists in the UN and how that institution must be reformed, but let us never forget the importance of having international organisations that strive to preserve peace.</p><p>Scottish people are very international in their outlook&#8212;they are internationalists&#8212;so although the motion is about acknowledging the ultimate sacrifice that Scots made, I want to pay tribute to those from other countries who fought on our behalf in the war. Those countries have their own veterans. More than 1.5 million Indians were in the services and we all know about the legendary tales of the Gurkhas. Labour market shortages meant that 800 forestry workers from the tropics were brought to work in the Scottish Highlands. Of the 300 West Indians who flew for the RAF, 90 received medals for bravery. Britain's west African colonies in Gambia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and <place-holder colnum=\"16882\"/> Nigeria served as staging posts and military bases during world war two. When the French colonies in west Africa were freed from Vichy domination, the west African British troops who were no longer needed in such great numbers for Home Guard duties were moved to Burma together with some of the east African brigades. Today, I was fascinated to learn that, in all, some 166,500 Africans were involved in helping to defeat the Japanese. All those people fought for freedom against the tyranny that would have triumphed in Europe had we not managed to stop it.</p><p>I will read out a quote from the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League, which asks:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"What made 5 million people from the Commonwealth volunteer to fight the Second World War alongside the 6 million British Forces? Who were these people and what motivated them? They were people who believed in freedom and were happy to fight alongside\"</p><p>us</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to make this World a safer place ... They came from all over the Commonwealth, a million from Canada; 2.5 million from the Indian sub-continent; from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, the Far East and from across Africa.\"</p><p>Some of those people have become new Scots; the members of their families are now second and third-generation Scots and believe themselves to be truly Scottish.</p><p>Sadly, we still have wars, as Chris Ballance mentioned. We have wars within, between and among nations. There is a vast amount of conflict going on in the world. We must pay tribute to those who still fight in conflicts and lay down their lives on our behalf. It is not just regular soldiers who go to the front line; there are peacekeepers all over the world who act on behalf of the UN.</p><p>There is also the Territorial Army, which goes to front-line conflict situations alongside the regular Army. The other day, I was disturbed to learn from the radio about the number of TA volunteers who need to go for therapy because, in the aftermath of war, they are suffering from post-traumatic stress. The 14-year issue was mentioned. I pay tribute to the members of the TA, who work very hard to defend this nation.</p><p>We are at war at the moment, although now is not the time to discuss that in any great detail. We are saluting the veterans of a past war. Regardless of political views around the chamber, we should and could all say that we hope for an end to the conflict that our countries are involved in as soon as possible, so that we have fewer veterans to salute in future.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13339910", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I apologise on behalf of my colleague Andrew Welsh, who asked me to do so because he had to leave the chamber for an urgent appointment.

I was immediately struck by the introduction to the plan, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Justice is at the heart of safer, stronger communities. Our justice system underpins strong communities where the values of fairness, tolerance and respect can flourish.\"</p><p>Too often, we are guilty of agreeing with such statements without looking at what lies behind them. I agree that justice can be at the heart of safer communities, but what of the inclusion of the word \"stronger\"? What about the flourishing of fairness, tolerance and respect? I suggest that another phrase&#8212;social justice&#8212;should be included in the introduction. That is at the heart of the process, which is not purely about the criminal justice system.</p><p>Roger Houchin, a former governor of Barlinnie prison, called in January of this year for a rethink of justice policy to reduce the offences that are punishable by prison, not just to solve the prison overcrowding problem but to help break the clear link between poverty and crime. His study revealed that a quarter of all prisoners come from just 53 of Scotland's 1,200 council wards&#8212;the 53 most deprived wards. Half of those in jail come from the poorest 13 per cent of council wards. In the same month, Audit Scotland released a report showing that half of all those who are released will be back in two years, and that drug rehabilitation programmes, despite the assertions of availability, were failing to reach prisoners. Less than half of those with a problem had received treatment.</p><p>I commend a book by my colleague Kenny MacAskill, in which members can read Roger Houchin's fascinating article. One of the points that Roger Houchin makes is that part of the reason for the growth in the prison population is that it allows the rest of us to divorce ourselves from the discomfort of having to engage with what he calls our underclass society, which the preponderance of prisoners&#8212;young men aged around 23, from the most deprived backgrounds&#8212;inhabit. One in nine men from deprived areas will be in prison during their 23<sup>rd</sup> year.</p><p>There are those who deny the link between poverty and crime by pointing out that crime rates increase most quickly when affluence growth is at its greatest. However, poverty is relative and cannot be framed as absolutely as that. Poverty in a society has nothing to do with bank balances; it has everything to do with being able to provide for oneself and one's family the parts of life that allow <place-holder colnum=\"16583\"/> one to be normal in the society in which one lives, rather than being shoved aside and made to feel that one is not part of it. I certainly do not agree with the theory that all property is theft, but it is not too far wide of the mark to describe the lack of facilities for normal living as a crime against society. The question then is: who is committing that crime?</p><p>The Administrations that we have had at Westminster over the past few decades have contributed to that crime through the individualism that they have espoused&#8212;it is only the individual that matters. We start to look at poverty almost as if it is a crime and as if it is the fault of the individual that they are underprivileged&#8212;there is no such thing as society. Sadly, the present Labour Government does nothing to reintroduce the values and philosophy of collectivism.</p><p>It has become almost a crime to be poor. I think that the crime is allowing poverty to cause such divisions in society. I believe firmly that criminality cannot be addressed until deprivation is addressed, and that that can be addressed only when we are all prepared to look it square in the face and call it for what it is. That does not mean that I am an apologist for criminals&#8212;I fully accept that there are some right bad swines of all ages out there and that, in some cases, there is no alternative to incarceration. However, it is time that we thought about the principles that underlie the Kilbrandon report and use them for adult justice as well as in the children's hearings system. We should sort out the problem and not try to hide it.</p><p>Having said that, there is some good stuff on which we can build among what the Executive says on the way forward. I was interested in some of the key elements that were noted in \"Supporting Safer, Stronger Communities: Scotland's Criminal Justice Plan\" for success in dealing with lower-level offending. Immediacy is one of the four elements and that is crucial. Visibility and accountability in the criminal justice system as a public service are important, because people feel a bit divorced from the system. I am sure that we all get complaints from folk who do not know why charges were dropped because nobody ever came back to tell them what had happened when something with which they were involved ended up in court. That is crucial, but so is the last element, which is active community involvement through a range of roles, often as volunteers.</p><p>That brings me back directly to one of my biggest bugbears, which is the fact that volunteers contribute so much to society. Volunteers save the Government a fortune. Let us look at funding voluntary organisations to do the job that they do really well. We must core fund them and let them get on with it.

I particularly endorse the call for necessary political action by the world's Governments. I would like the United Kingdom to take this year's opportunity to lead by example. At the beginning of the debate, Margaret Ewing spoke about how we will not achieve the millennium development goals, judging by current progress. So let us have the UK lead the way by immediately implementing the 0.7 per cent of GNP target. I would love to see this Parliament lobby the UK Government to achieve that target in the year in which the G8 meeting takes place in Gleneagles.</p><p>In reality, the UK's pledge to pay 0.7 per cent of GNP is 35 years old, so it is no great shakes that the Chancellor of the Exchequer now says that he will meet the target some time in the future. After some 35 years, the Government is spending only half that amount on aid. I ask members to think about this: since making that pledge in 1970, the UK Government has underspent its aid budget and short-changed the world's poorest by &#163;76 billion. We owe that to the undeveloped countries. If we are serious about leading the way, let us start by promising something extra. It would be good if we were leading the way.<place-holder colnum=\"16462\"/></p><p>I have loads to say, but I assure the Presiding Officer that I will look at the clock all the time while I run through these points quickly. On the role of women, which was mentioned by Susan Deacon, I firmly believe from my limited experience of visiting underdeveloped countries that women are key. We must educate girls and women, who can pass that education on to their children. Women lead civic society in all the underdeveloped countries. The saying that men talk but women do may be a clich&#233; but it is often also a reality. We need to fund women from the bottom up.</p><p>I also want funding to be given to small initiatives. We are good at pointing out all the big things that need to be done, but small initiatives in countries and communities are what really help things to happen. Such initiatives can also bypass corrupt Governments, which people always cite as an argument for not delivering aid.</p><p>We also need communication strategies. Let us consider the use of community radio, mobile phones and existing solar technology. When I was in the Andean region of Latin America, I was fascinated by the dependence of the indigenous populations on community radio for so much learning. That was absolutely fantastic.</p><p>I am aware that I am running out of time, but I want to congratulate the NGOs on the way in which they have co-ordinated their actions in the make poverty history campaign. Such coming together is not new, although it is wonderful that it is very formalised this time round. However, the NGOs have been co-ordinating for years in initiatives such as the jubilee 2000 campaign. Oxfam and all the other organisations have always worked together towards the goal of eliminating poverty.</p><p>While I am on the subject of the jubilee 2000 debt campaign, I want to mention that we need to revise some of the debt relief stuff. The way in which we currently administer export credits is an absolute nonsense. We need to look at that again.</p><p>We also need to consider other initiatives. I am not convinced about the use of gold bullion, which Donald Gorrie suggested, but whatever happened to the Tobin tax? I bet that loads of members were once signed up to that idea. Perhaps we should reconsider such a tax on currency transactions.</p><p>Finally, I must mention&#8212;as it is also a local issue for me&#8212;the campaigners of the jubilee 2000 drop the debt campaign, who will do a wonderful cycle around the UK that will culminate at Gleneagles. Those folk have done such things for years. They have been at every single summit since the one in Birmingham in 1998.

The life history of many women offenders has been detailed by previous speakers.</p><p>At this point, I would like to say that I am not denying that at times there are women who require custodial sentences. Today, we have heard a lot about shoplifting as an example. Occasionally there are shoplifters who deserve to be put in prison because their behaviour is not caused by poverty, and they can be women as well as men. We should not get too sentimental about the subject. However, the evidence suggests that too often women who are perceived as offenders are in fact victims.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson mentioned fine defaulting in relation to prostitution. I have had chats with women who work as prostitutes and they spoke about the vicious circle that they are in. They are fined for being on the street, but they have to go back on the street to be able to pay the fine. That is another debate, but there is a relevant point in it for today's debate.</p><p>The ministerial group on women offenders, which reported in 2002, was set up in response to the Scottish Office review that I mentioned. In reading the group's report, I noted that although there is an upward trend in prisoner numbers, the number of convictions has decreased. Are sentences becoming harsher? If so, why is that happening despite the recognition of the issues that surround the incarceration of women offenders? I am pleased that alternatives to custody are now on the agenda. The 218 time-out centre initiative in Glasgow seems to be one part of the answer and I look forward to the analysis of its work when it has operated for an appropriate period of time.</p><p>As has been noted, a further part of the answer is prevention, but realistically there will always be a need for reactive measures as well, to discourage repeat offending. That is to the benefit of the whole of society because, after all, more women offenders than male offenders have dependent children living with them and studies have shown that such women are likely to be lone parents. That is where the SNP amendment comes in.

Members did not know that they were getting a double act today.</p><p>The Executive has a tendency to believe that, once something has been announced, it will just happen, as if the problem has already been solved. Sometimes the Executive does not realise that the practicalities can be difficult. For example, there can be good legislation on homelessness but not enough local authority resources. Local housing strategies were announced four years ago, but how many have been approved? In that regard, I return to an idea that I have spoken about in the chamber before: having the right to a house does not actually put a roof over a person's head.</p><p>Some items within \"Homes for Scotland's People\" are aspirational but worthy of further practical consideration. I was extremely interested in the consultation document on shared equity when it came out, because I have felt strongly on that subject for many years. In her speech, to which I listened carefully, the deputy minister said that the subsidy would be in perpetuity and would be recyclable. However, in \"Homes for Scotland's People\", I noticed the potential for full buy-out within shared equity. I would like to hear more detail on who will make those strategic decisions. Will the decisions be devolved&#8212;as they should be&#8212;to local authorities, who know the supply and demand issues in their areas better than anyone? Will local authorities have the right, in partnership with registered social landlords&#8212;who will perhaps supply the shared equity&#8212;to say, \"No, there shall be no 100 per cent buy-out in this location\"? I look forward to detailed answers to those questions.<place-holder colnum=\"15371\"/></p><p>Paragraph 1.5 of the Executive's document contains the aim:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to enable young people to remain in rural communities.\"</p><p>In the rural communities in which I have worked in housing, houses are built and then&#8212;not far down the line&#8212;end up in the holiday home market. In Galloway and Perthshire, for example, that is a big issue.</p><p>There is an anomaly in introducing shared equity while we still have the extremely cumbersome shared ownership scheme. What will happen to that?</p><p>The biggest anomaly of all is that the right to buy is still draining the social rented sector of thousands of properties each year. On current projections, the social rented market will lose three houses for every house that is scheduled for construction. That makes no sense. I know that the question of right of buy is up for discussion with the Executive again next year, but I ask the minister to put minds at rest by at least cancelling the extension to housing associations that is due in 2012.</p><p>I note from paragraph 3.23 of \"Homes for Scotland's People\" that the Executive feels that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A well functioning housing market will reduce pressure on the need for public investment in affordable housing, while the provision of low cost home ownership can reduce pressure on the social rented sector.\"</p><p>The reverse is also true. A well-resourced social housing sector will reduce pressure on those people who feel that they have to buy, who sometimes cannot afford to do so, but who feel that they have no other way of getting a roof over their head. The perception that to own is good and that to rent is bad can, and should be, reversed. The balance has tipped a bit too far, but we can rectify that if the will is there. That is not to deny that there are many people who wish to own but who find it difficult to get on to the housing ladder. That is why properly managed shared equity is welcome. A range of financial packages to assist first-time buyers would also help, as the Scottish National Party's amendment notes.</p><p>I turn to housing supply. I know that colleagues will deal with the issues of infrastructure and Scottish Water later in the debate. Fine words and good intentions are all very well, but practicalities take over. I received an answer to a parliamentary question that stated that no new approved social rented schemes had been delayed because of constraints imposed by Scottish Water. I find that difficult to accept and presume that the answer was slightly disingenuous; it is probably the case that schemes are not being approved until Scottish Water is sorted out.<place-holder colnum=\"15372\"/></p><p>Developers of private housing are adamant about the fact that infrastructure delays are likely to continue. I read with interest Lewis Macdonald's comments that, in cases in which demolition had taken place, there would be no need for infrastructure investment when a similar number of properties was to be built. That is another example of the theory not matching the reality. Historically, water and sewerage infrastructure has often been operating over capacity, so Scottish Water will insist on upgrading work before it allows new housing developments&#8212;even when houses have been demolished. Does the minister really believe that when the Red Road flats in Glasgow are demolished, it will be possible for the same number of houses to be serviced on that site without any further infrastructure investment being necessary?</p><p>Talking of sites, I was pleased to hear more about the initiative on the release of land in public ownership. It is interesting that the Forestry Commission is involved, but I would like to know whether the scheme will be extended to the Ministry of Defence, which owns lots of land in Scotland. In situations in which local authorities have engaged in land banking, will the Executive use powers to ensure the development of social rented housing, where that is required?</p><p>I could cover many other issues that underpin our housing system, but lack of time means that I am unable to do so. In addition to the single seller survey, measures to do with the land register, conveyancing and single title deeds and conditions could make a big difference to how houses are purchased in this country. I might be able to deal with those issues in the future.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-2585.2, to leave out from \"to increase the quantity\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and, while welcoming the Housing (Scotland) Bill, notes that the target of 21,500 affordable homes over three years has to be offset against the 18,000 homes per year sold under the right to buy; therefore calls for the right to buy to be reformed for new tenants, while preserving the rights of existing tenants; further acknowledges the insurmountable difficulties for many young people in a first-time purchase, and calls for the introduction of a range of financial packages to assist first-time buyers, including a first-time buyers' grant.\"</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336005", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There we are.

Christine Grahame and I were both on the committee that put together the report. It was extremely interesting and we found the evidence from all concerned highly enlightening. Fiona Hyslop summed up the issue when she referred to the three Cs in describing what we are trying to achieve. They are consistency, clarity and confidence: consistency of treatment by the regulator; clarity of interpretation by those operating charities; and confidence for the public that they are supporting or donating to bona fide charities. That is extremely important.</p><p>In closing this debate for the SNP, I want to cover some of the issues that have already been raised, but I also want to touch on some that have not yet been mentioned. In opening, the minister talked about OSCR and spoke of proportionate and balanced regulation and co-operation with other regulators. He also mentioned that, under <place-holder colnum=\"15140\"/> the bill, Communities Scotland was taking over some regulatory functions from OSCR. I know that there will be co-operation and a reporting mechanism, and I look forward to hearing more about how that will work, because it is important that all charities are registered and monitored to some extent by the central agency, which will be OSCR.</p><p>Talking of co-operation, I would like to say that I believe that that is what committee members of all parties should do. When members are unable to attend an event, they should have confidence that their fellow members will report back to them accurately. I found the sniping on that issue&#8212;by both Mary Scanlon and the convener&#8212;extremely petty and demeaning of themselves and of the committee.</p><p>Tricia Marwick is very keen on the independence test, and other members mentioned third-party control and how we have to be careful about independence for all charities. We know that the national collections, for example, will be able to preserve their charitable status, because something will be done to look after them. However, we have to be careful about local authorities and arm's-length organisations. Although most of us have confidence in most local authorities, there have been instances when that confidence has been rocked and Tricia Marwick mentioned one such instance. We look forward to discussing that in more detail at stage 2.</p><p>On the charity test and on charitable purposes, the benefit of the public and the common good, the minister said that we need a set of purposes that reflect Scotland's needs. I was pleased to hear him say that we do not necessarily need to match what is done elsewhere in the United Kingdom, because what we have should be what Scotland needs. However, the committee has suggested that we could consider amendments at stage 2 to reflect more truly the objectives of the charitable sector in Scotland. Patrick Harvie gave a couple of examples of what the committee discussed: the broadening of religious purposes and the reconsideration of the relief of poverty. The RNLI asked the committee to consider adding the saving of lives to the preservation of health and well-being.</p><p>Scott Barrie mentioned charity trustees and the definition in the bill of misconduct. I know that he felt quite strongly about that at the committee, as did I. Many other members also had concerns. David Davidson has missed the point. Section 65(4) of the bill states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Any breach ... is to be treated as being misconduct in the administration of the charity.\"</p><p>The word \"misconduct\" implies more than bad practice, for all that civil servants and lawyers can <place-holder colnum=\"15141\"/> say that the dictionary definition covers a range of things. The perception is that if someone is found guilty of misconduct they have been at it: they have had their hands in the till or they have deliberately done something wrong. Scott Barrie is right to say that that provision could put people off serving as a charity trustee. I would like the terminology to differentiate between problems that arise from incompetence or are unintentional, and problems that are intentional or caused by misdemeanour. That change should be straightforward and simple. I look forward to that discussion.</p><p>That brings me to public benefit, which has been the most contentious aspect of the discussion today. I am at a loss as to why Christine Grahame's amendment has been so contentious. First, it addresses the colleges. We heard comments from both Fiona Hyslop and Cathie Craigie on the problem of further education colleges. The committee was concerned by the submission of the Association of Scottish Colleges that unless something is done to preserve their charitable status they could lose &#163;13 million in tax relief. The minister did not mention what he is going to do about the matter, so I look forward to hearing about that.</p><p>That covers the first part of the SNP amendment. I do not see why that is contentious, nor do I see why the second part of the amendment is contentious. It does not mention independent schools, although Christine Grahame mentioned them in her speech in response to the SSP amendment and when she gave valid examples of what could arise under the bill. It is worth repeating that paragraph 150 of the committee's report clearly reflects what is in Christine Grahame's amendment. Paragraph 150 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"ensuring that only those organisations which have as their overriding purpose the provision of a benefit to the public should qualify for charitable status.\"</p><p>It also calls for a</p><p class=\"indent\">\"greater emphasis on the need to meet the public benefit test on the face of the Bill.\"</p><p>The SNP amendment is exactly what the committee has recommended. I fail to see the problem.</p><p>The SCVO was held up as a marvellous organisation, which it is, and thanked for its contribution to the stage 1 consideration. It agrees that this is an important point and its submission states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"SCVO believes that the provision of explicit criteria of public benefit is critical to the effectiveness of the Act\".</p><p>It suggests:<place-holder colnum=\"15142\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Bill should provide that 'only those organisations otherwise eligible for charity status which have as their overriding purpose the provision of a benefit to the public should qualify for charitable status'\".</p><p>I suggest that every member of the Communities Committee, which compiled the report, should support the SNP amendment.

It was a story about a girl in Africa who was mutilated in that way; at that time, the procedure was not given the name of FGM. Although I remember being horrified when I read it, at the back of my mind was the thought that that sort of practice does not happen; I thought that it was just one of those things that is put into a story. However, when I was elected to the Parliament, I started to learn more about FGM.</p><p>I was pleased when I heard that the Equal Opportunities Committee was to scrutinise the bill. As much as anything, the scrutiny has been an awareness-raising exercise for people in Scotland, with Elaine Smith as reporter meeting the Somali women's action group and reports coming out from the committee. We should all know about a practice that is likely to become more prevalent in our society, as the world moves and immigrants and asylum seekers come to Scotland, many from the countries where FGM is still carried out.</p><p>I have followed with interest what happened at the committee and Sandra White has also kept me informed. I was therefore interested to read the <place-holder colnum=\"15053\"/> committee's report and will take a personal look at some of its recommendations.</p><p>The first recommendation about which I feel strongly is recommendation 12, which says that the World Health Organisation classification system should be adopted in the bill. Type IV FGM, as defined by the WHO, is mutilation. It might not involve someone taking a knife and cutting to the same extent as under other definitions, but</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the introduction of corrosive substances ... into the vagina to cause bleeding or for the purpose of tightening or narrowing it\"</p><p>is surely mutilation&#8212;there are no two ways about it. I ask the Executive to reconsider the definitions that it is using in the bill.</p><p>I agree with the committee recommendation that the Executive should specifically exclude reduction labioplasty, which is a practice that is happening across western society.</p><p>Recommendation 14 says that the Executive</p><p class=\"indent\">\"should specify in the Bill the particular procedures which it wishes to remain outwith the scope of the Bill\".</p><p>Although I agree with what Sandra White said earlier on the subject, as the debate has moved on, I also have sympathy for the minister's view that that might cause problems. I am open-minded on the subject. If an amendment is lodged to address the recommendation, the debate can only be healthy and all of us will learn more from it.</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly that there should be no age limit in the bill. I also agree that reinfibulation should be defined. I note that, in evidence to the committee, the minister said that he felt that the definition was implicit in the bill. I am not sure that that is enough; the definition should be stated explicitly in the bill.</p><p>I turn to the crucial question of information dissemination both to the professionals who require it and to the communities that are affected. The people we are dealing with in those communities are coming to Scotland from countries where 98 to 99 per cent of the women are mutilated in this way. There is a strength of culture in those communities about FGM, which transcends religion and country boundaries. We are talking not about mothers who want to be cruel to their children but about mothers and other women in a society&#8212;and even men&#8212;who believe that FGM is in the interest of the young girl. That is a very hard cultural barrier to get over and it is crucial that we get information into communities that the practice is wrong.</p><p>We also need to tell young women and girls how they can get help if they suspect that FGM is going to be done to them. A 12, 13 or 14-year-old has to know where to go if her parents tell her suddenly <place-holder colnum=\"15054\"/> that she is to go to Somalia for a two-week holiday. If the girl fears that the reason for the visit is to have FGM done to her, she should know where to go to get the visit stopped.</p><p>With the honourable exception of the minister, it is interesting to note that no men have taken part in the debate. Also, with very few exceptions, no men have been in the chamber to listen to the debate. I do not want to have a go at the guys, cross party, but issues that affect women or involve violence towards women are often seen as women's issues. However, FGM is not a women's issue; it is a human rights issue that is about people in our society who are forcibly mutilated.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13335222", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Some years ago, I read an Alice Walker novel about female genital mutilation.

All issues are women's issues and men's issues, especially when they involve abuse of human rights.</p><p>In educating communities that carry out the practice, which they see as the cultural norm, we must involve men. Given that such communities are often patriarchal, no matter how many educated women say that the practice is not right and that people should not put up with it, the prominent men in those societies need to say that, too, before it is taken seriously. Education must first be disseminated to the males; they must be taught that the practice is completely unacceptable, which will then pass through families to the women, after which we can start to move on. Nora Radcliffe mentioned Elaine Smith's comments about men. One crucial point that Elaine made was that we will make progress only when men stop demanding mutilated brides. We must push for education for men.</p><p>As Sandra White said, the Executive might be worried that cross-border issues may arise if we use different definitions from those used at Westminster and expand the scope of our bill beyond that of the legislation at Westminster. I agree with Sandra that we should get the bill right. If Westminster wants to amend its legislation to bring it up to the same standard as ours and if that is better for the people who are affected, that is fine. We should care not about the ease of legislating but about what is best for the communities that are involved.</p><p>One crucial issue is information for medical staff.

It is important that every year in Fairtrade fortnight we should have a debate about fair trade. A long time ago&#8212;I think it was three years ago&#8212;I sponsored a debate on fair trade when Strathaven, where I live, and Aberfeldy in my colleague John Swinney's constituency were declared Scotland's first fair trade towns. Both of us considered it an honour to speak in that debate.</p><p>Strathaven has gone from strength to strength since then. The small market town in Lanarkshire has become a model for other places in South Lanarkshire to follow. In fact, next week at the council offices, Hamilton&#8212;the biggest town in South Lanarkshire&#8212;will formally declare its fair trade status and receive its certificate. South Lanarkshire Council has not only done a lot in its council premises for fair trade, but has been a tower of strength to all groups in the area that want to promote fair trade.<place-holder colnum=\"14926\"/></p><p>Christine May mentioned that yesterday she met youngsters from primary schools in Strathaven and Avondale. One of the big strengths in Strathaven is the schools programme that we have instituted. We have seven primary schools and one academy in Strathaven and the surrounding area. I am very proud to announce that next week the Fairtrade Foundation will present Sandford Primary School with a special initiative certificate as Scotland's first fair trade school. [<em>Applause.</em>] I agree&#8212;that deserves a clap. Chapelton Primary School and Kirklandpark Primary School are close to achieving that status as well, and the other four primary schools are on the way. Some of the sixth year pupils at Strathaven Academy are determined that by the time they finish their exams and leave this year, it will have been declared the first fair trade secondary school in Scotland. A special initiative certificate was awarded because the Fairtrade Foundation had no criteria for fair trade schools. It had not got round to putting the criteria together, because the movement had grown so quickly that it had focused on keeping on top of towns, villages, councils and universities. It is a first for Strathaven that we have set the criteria for fair trade schools in the UK.</p><p>Fair trade is a priority. Raising awareness of fair trade is included in the national five-to-14 curriculum as a topic within environmental studies and citizenship. It is great that the schools in Strathaven have taken that on board. They have set up fair trade groups within all the schools, which include representation from pupils, staff and parents, and they run a fair trade tuck shop. Also, the schools will actively promote fair trade products in the provision of school meals, which ties in with what Christine May said about promoting fair trade in all public places.</p><p>Well done Strathaven, for blazing the trail yet again for Scotland and the UK.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334890", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fairtrade Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christine May for bringing the debate to Parliament.

The principle of openness means that our deliberations here in the chamber and in committee should be as widely seen as possible, with no one having difficulty in finding out about them. The principle of accountability means that this Parliament belongs to the people of Scotland and should have to report to the people of Scotland for the actions that it undertakes. Similarly, that principle means that the Executive should be accountable to the Parliament and, thereby, to all of Scotland. The principle of equal opportunities means that we should strive to ensure that everyone has a chance to work with and in their Parliament to advance Scotland, and that there should be no equivocation as a result of differences. Finally, the principle of engagement with the Scottish people means that the Parliament belongs to all of us, not just to the politicians who work here for a short time, and we should always remember that.</p><p>Those are precious and valuable principles on which the electorate voted to create, or recreate, this Parliament in 1997, and they should underpin our democracy now and in the future. We should all be looking to protect and expand the opportunities that exist for people to become involved, driving those principles forward just as they should be driving us forward. There should be no reversing and no cutting back on the very foundations of the institution that we are privileged to work in.</p><p>The work done by the Scottish Civic Forum has adhered to those principles, ensuring that our Parliament does in fact belong properly to us all. I point to the forum's work in ensuring that briefings on the work of the Parliament are available to all, pushing forward the openness part of the agenda. <place-holder colnum=\"14842\"/></p><p>The same is true when it comes to providing briefings on the legislation that is being proposed. The forum encourages groups and individuals to engage with the legislative process, and its network of local co-ordinators has been highly successful in my area and in other areas. The forum actively encourages responses to consultations, allowing those with an interest to have their voices heard.</p><p>In other words, the Scottish Civic Forum is driving the public engagement that we keep hearing that all politicians want. Perhaps, indeed, it is engagement with the political process, rather than the party-political process, that will drive voter turnout back up. Perhaps the Scottish Civic Forum, properly resourced, could be the vehicle that helps to reignite the spark of public political debate and enthusiasm here in Scotland. For example, the forum's discussion on discrimination has been so successful in terms of participation that it now has its own website. How often do we say that we want to encourage public participation and how often do we actually manage to get a response? How much does the Executive spend on its consultations and what are the general response rates there?</p><p>There is no doubt that the Scottish Civic Forum has been determined in its efforts to drive forward the founding principles of the Parliament. The model is so successful that Ken Livingstone's London Administration has copied it. I do not always agree with Ken Livingstone, and he has not had his troubles to seek recently, but there are times when he makes the right decisions, and this is one of them.</p><p>There has also been interest in the work of the forum from around the world. Like many others, at meetings in Europe and further afield I have expounded with pride on the Parliament's power-sharing principles&#8212;the Public Petitions Committee, the Scottish Youth Parliament and the Civic Forum.</p><p>My most recent overseas visitor was Wilbert Rozas, a municipal mayor from the Andes in Peru. The Civic Forum met him at length and explained in detail the work that it does. He was astounded. He has gone back to Cusco and will show our model of public participation all over his region of Peru.</p><p>The plenary sessions of the Civic Forum, which we should host regularly and encourage, have allowed individuals and groups that are active in civic society to use the Parliament to debate the issues that are most important to them. I remember well the Civic Forum debate in the chamber on the Mound on the first anniversary of the Parliament.</p><p>We should expand the activities of the forum to <place-holder colnum=\"14843\"/> bring it more and more into the lives of the people of our country. We should allow it to go further in advancing the principles of the Parliament and use it as a vehicle to reverse the cynicism and apathy that people feel about politics.</p><p>Why does the Civic Forum face a cut in funding from its major funder? I do not believe that ministers want the forum to be quiet and go away. We may be political rivals, but I have a bit more respect for members of the Executive than that. I do not believe that it would be more comfortable for ministers if the Civic Forum was not there and I do not believe that the forum has made life overly difficult for any minister. In fact, some people have suggested that the forum works for ministers. Of course, I believe nothing of the sort but I can understand how that perception could come about when the forum is, in large part, funded by the Government.</p><p>I appreciate that some people think that the forum should stand on its own feet but, unless someone can show me where the funding can come from to replace central Government funding, I say that we would be sold short. To expect the forum to bid for work in order to stay afloat compromises its neutrality and impartiality. Democracy does not come cheap; nor does mass participation in democracy. If we believe in democracy we must also believe in paying for it.</p><p>I believe that the Parliament should take over the funding of the forum. That would take it out of the realm of party politics and make it far more a part of Scotland's civic life. We have a duty to everyone in Scotland to ensure that that is done and that the vision that we started with back in 1997 is kept alive. We should strengthen and extend the work of the forum and expand its funding and its functions. To do that, we have to put its funding beyond doubt: for me, the Parliament has that responsibility. I know that, at the time, Scottish Office lawyers said that that would not be allowed under the Scotland Act 1998, but I am not convinced. We must remember that the Scotland Act 1998 works the other way round: what is not expressly prohibited is allowed. It is interesting that schedule 2, paragraph 4(1) states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the corporation\"&#8212;</p><p>that is, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"may do anything which appears to it to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of or in connection with the discharge of its functions.\"</p><p>My argument today is that it is our responsibility to ensure that the work of the Civic Forum is carried on and closely aligned with the work of the Parliament. If that is our responsibility, it is <place-holder colnum=\"14844\"/> practically the corporate body's duty to fund the Civic Forum.</p><p>I hope that when we leave the Parliament, whether through defeat or retirement, we want to leave a legacy behind us&#8212;something that we have achieved. I would say that strengthening civic Scotland to ensure that it can work alongside Scotland's Parliament is a pretty good legacy to leave behind and that we should work towards that.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334730", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Civic Forum"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This Parliament was founded on four principles.

As others have said, I am absolutely certain that locking up asylum seekers, throwing them on to the streets of our cities and referring to them as bogus or illegal immigrants or as economic migrants contribute to that negativity.</p><p>Rosie Kane, Elaine Smith, Patrick Harvie, Christine Grahame, Cathy Peattie and other members have all spoken of the fresh talent that we already have here in Scotland. There are a great many skilled professionals awaiting Home Office decisions on their asylum applications. Why are we not allowing those people the dignity of working and taking advantage of the contribution that they can make to our services? I hope that, under the fresh talent initiative, the First Minister is lobbying hard at Westminster&#8212;perhaps on the quiet, without our knowing&#8212;to allow the Government here in Scotland to make such decisions, to the benefit of us all.</p><p>The Executive has done well with its racism strategy, over which it has power. The Scottish refugee integration action plan is an example of that. Another example is the push to combat institutional racism. We still have a long way to go, but even the Parliament's recognition of the fact that institutional racism exists in our society is a big step forward compared with where we were a few years ago.</p><p>However, I have concerns about the results of a report that the Commission for Racial Equality published in 2003, but which I looked at only lately. The report monitors the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. In March 2002, the Scottish Parliament approved new duties that were designed to help authorities better to meet their general duty under the act. Public authorities were asked to publish a race equality scheme by 30 November 2002. Education authorities were asked to publish a race equality policy by the same date.</p><p>The report covered 77 Scottish public authorities: the 32 local authorities; 32 education authorities; five central Government and related agencies; and eight police forces. Albeit that it was published a year ago, I found some of its findings worrying, including the finding that 89 per cent of <place-holder colnum=\"14564\"/> public authorities said that they had difficulty in meeting the duty. They reported substantial difficulties in allocating resources and prioritising the work.</p><p>Only one education authority sent in an REP that largely met the requirements of the duty. The majority of local authority schemes only partly met the duty&#8212;all of them required more work. Only one public authority had a fully developed plan of action to improve access to information and services. Will the minister give the chamber a further update&#8212;if not today, fairly soon after the debate&#8212;on the current status of public bodies in meeting their statutory general duty under the act?</p><p>I will address the amendments to the motion. I defend the right of Opposition parties to lodge amendments to any subject for debate. We have far too many subject debates&#8212;the sort of debate that does not allow us to get into the meat of the thing. Members' views do not really get heard in those debates; we are unable to put forward our party or group point of view.</p><p>As Sandra White said earlier, the SNP will accept&#8212;I say \"accept\"; I wish that we were in a position to accept amendments. The SNP will support the amendment in Rosie Kane's name. The SSP amendment says many of the things that the SNP group in the Parliament has been saying for some time. Right at the beginning of my speech, I said that current immigration and asylum policy undermines the Government in Scotland. I am happy to support the SSP amendment.</p><p>I turn to the Tory amendment. If I picked up correctly what the Conservatives were saying, they lodged the amendment because the fresh talent document does not mention racism or immigration policy. The Conservatives might have a point, but we cannot support them, because the last lines of their amendment say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a fair system of immigration control is necessary in order to promote good race relations.\"</p><p>There is something very strange about that wording. It echoes some of the comments that the Tories' UK leader has made about control, quotas and tearing up United Nations conventions. Members on the Tory benches might think that it is acceptable to tear up United Nations conventions, but SNP members cannot go along with that.</p><p>It is a bit rich for Jamie McGrigor to moan about a political party using Scotland as a pilot project.

I come from the point of view of someone who, over the years, has had dealings with and has thought about the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p><p>I am pleased about much of what the Lord Advocate said this morning, because it touched on many of the problems that the public perceive with the system. The criminal justice system and the Procurator Fiscal Service have hardly changed in 300 years, yet, if we consider the booklet on the 2003-04 review of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, it appears that quite a lot has changed in the past five years. However, there is a bit further to go.</p><p>I was particularly pleased to hear the Lord Advocate's announcement on the disclosure, where possible, of the reasons for a case not proceeding. That is a great step forward, which will be welcomed by everyone. In the almost six years since I was elected, there has been much disquiet about that point. I add, though&#8212;and I would welcome feedback on this&#8212;that I have an issue with the general lack of information for victims of crime. I say that from my experience of being a witness twice in different cases over the past five years. They were only at Hamilton sheriff court, not the supreme court that Jeremy Purvis was fortunate enough to attend. On one occasion I was a victim of crime, and therefore a witness, and on the other occasion I was purely a witness. I still do not know the outcome of either case. In the case in which I was a victim, I do not know whether the chap was prosecuted, because nobody told me. In the case in which I was a witness, I do not know <place-holder colnum=\"14459\"/> the result. That is not for want of trying to find out. The cases did not affect me badly, but for someone who has been badly affected by crime to feel that they are completely left out of the loop must be psychologically difficult. I would like the Lord Advocate to respond on that point. It could be that action is already being taken in that regard.</p><p>I was impressed with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service 2003-04 review booklet&#8212;there are a many good things in it. I was pleasantly surprised to note the many achievements described in the \"Building Public Confidence\" section, such as the equality advisory group&#8212;equality being a subject that the Parliament has always felt strongly about. That is welcome. The openness of hosting visits for young people from non-professional backgrounds to try to interest them in the profession is good stuff too. The partnership with the Ethnic Minorities Law Centre is excellent, as is the fact that guidance has been issued on race crime. That is another issue about which all MSPs feel strongly. Building public confidence is what it is all about. That is important, because the perception is that the legal profession is a law unto itself and that it does not care about the people it directly affects.</p><p>The most important part of the review booklet is the \"Continuing Reform\" section at the back, because progress is still being made. It is important that there are more staff members but, as Stewart Stevenson mentioned, morale is equally important. Any service is only as good as the people who work in it. Staff morale is very important. The modernisation of information technology is extremely important too. I wonder whether the Lord Advocate has any idea how much paperwork has been saved since the IT system was put in place. I can hear the Solicitor General saying, \"Lots.\" That is good news.</p><p>It was useful to read about the pilot youth courts in Hamilton and Airdrie, and the victims of crime pilot schemes that Jeremy Purvis mentioned&#8212;one of which is in Kilmarnock&#8212;that enable people to write in describing the effect that a crime had on them. I would like to know how those pilots are progressing, whether they will be expanded and when they will report back.</p><p>All in all, I welcome the reforms that were put in place in 2001. They are progressing well, and I hope that they will continue to make good progress. However, the core of such reforms should always be building public confidence in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, because, while much has been achieved so far&#8212;I congratulate the Justice 1 Committee on that&#8212;there is still a long way to go in that area.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13333679", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I come to the debate as one of those souls that Kenny MacAskill talked about who have no legal experience and who have not had the great honour of serving on one of the justice committees.

I will focus on one sector of the elderly population: elderly carers, who are mentioned in the Scottish National Party amendment and who are referred to in some measure in what the Executive's motion says about the contribution that older people make to our communities. I can think of no bigger contribution than that which is made by elderly carers. In Scotland, 500,000 people are carers and most of them are over 55 years old. Those figures come directly from the Scottish Executive's website.<place-holder colnum=\"13871\"/></p><p>A couple of years ago, Help the Aged commissioned a study, which was carried out by the University of Kent, called \"Caring in Later Life: Reviewing the role of older carers\". It painted a bleak United Kingdom-wide picture and, despite there having been enacted under devolution some legislation that affects carers, all would agree that we still have a long way to go. That study found that more than half of older carers suffer from a long-standing illness or disability. It revealed that three quarters of the older people who live with the person for whom they care receive no regular visits from the health service, social services or home-care agencies and that more than half of them put in long hours of intensive caring on very low incomes while suffering from serious health problems. One third of those carers said that they had never had a break, and carers aged 75 or over were more likely to provide intensive care than those between 60 and 74.</p><p>That brings me to another UK study, which was carried out by Jane Hubert and Sheila Hollins, about people with intellectual disabilities and their elderly carers. I will focus on that topic, because I have met many people in my region who are in that situation. The majority of people with intellectual disabilities&#8212;or learning disabilities, as they are also called&#8212;in the UK live at home with their families, usually with their parents or, more commonly in later life, with one parent, usually their mother. That raises many issues. For parent and for adult son or daughter, there is a physical issue. When a person is getting older, something as basic as mobility affects significantly how well they can care for the person whom they love so much.</p><p>Mental health is also an issue:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Psychiatric disorders, including depression, affective disorders, anxiety disorders and delusional disorders, are more frequent among elderly people with intellectual disabilities than among the general elderly population.\"</p><p>I quote from the report that I mentioned, because the researchers say it better than I can.</p><p>It is clear that aging carers and their adult children will have a complex set of individual and joint needs. The needs of an older person with intellectual disabilities may conflict badly with those of an elderly parent. I have had the privilege of meeting the Murray Owen Carers Group, which is a group of elderly carers of adult children with learning disabilities in East Kilbride and I have heard some of their stories of the very basic difficulties that they face. For example&#8212;this is about a lady I know&#8212;how is a woman of 80 supposed to cope with the fact that her son, who is over 40, refuses to get into the bath or shower in the morning? That is very difficult, in both a physical and a mental sense. The stress is enormous.<place-holder colnum=\"13872\"/></p><p>There are also worries about bereavement when it comes to elderly parents. For people with learning disabilities, the loss of a parent&#8212;especially the sole surviving parent&#8212;is so much worse than it is for the average person, because they can find it so difficult to understand that their mother is no longer there one day when they come home from the learning centre. People in that situation can often be excluded from the rituals and processes that are associated with illness and death. Although they are aware that their life has suddenly changed, they sometimes do not understand why. Couple that with their having to move into a strange environment, which might be an institution or some kind of accommodation that they share with other people or another family. They might instead stay in the same house; I know someone in that situation. A person can end up staying in the same place, with a visit two or three times a day from a carer or from assorted carers. Such a change in a person's life must be absolutely awful for them to cope with.</p><p>Planning must begin long before that point is reached. I would like the Executive to consider that seriously. The Murray Owen Carers Group has submitted a public petition, because it feels that despite implementation of \"The same as you?\" whose good intentions the group does not knock in any way, there are many hidden families whose needs are not being addressed because everything is focused on taking people from institutions&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;and putting them back into the community.</p><p>I ask the Minister for Communities or the Deputy Minister for Communities to meet me and representatives of the Murray Owen Carers Group. I am sure that the group represents people from all over the country who are in the same position.

I am not convinced that the best people for the job are running the show&#8212;that is another debate&#8212;but I am convinced that Ayrshire should, on behalf of Scotland, be promoting Robert Burns and his work in every way possible. The Burns festival is truly important. We should capitalise on it and build on it. In Ayrshire and in Scotland as a whole, we should show pride in everything related to our national bard.</p><p>Alex Neil mentioned Shakespeare, who is England's national bard. Shakespeare's birthplace and places associated with his legacy are never neglected or allowed to fall into disrepair&#8212;there is no argument about that. We have to show pride in Burns, his poetry, his philosophy, his egalitarianism and his sterling service to our culture in collecting and promoting traditional song.</p><p>Kilmarnock, which is part of the area that I represent, is the birthplace of the first edition of Burns's poetry, which is a wonderful legacy for the town. As Margaret Jamieson said, public subscription built the Burns monument in Kay park in Kilmarnock in 1879. Sadly, the monument was neglected over the years and in 2004 was destroyed by fire. The monument must be saved. East Ayrshire Council has a duty to save it on behalf of the people of Kilmarnock.</p><p>The Scottish Executive has a duty to assist if required, through whatever means possible, in preserving and promoting the heritage of Scotland's national bard on behalf of the people of Scotland. If the will is there, the means can be found. I look forward to hearing what Historic Scotland's plans are. What is not needed is for the Burns monument merely to be patched and repaired and preserved as a shell.</p><p>I do not believe that Robert Burns would have wanted sterile monuments to be created in his honour. I think that the man would truly have appreciated a focal point and a centre for the living, breathing and wonderful culture of our <place-holder colnum=\"13828\"/> country, to which he contributed in his time. That can be done. People and local groups have the knowledge, the capability and the experience to realise such an ambition. For example, the highly respected and successful Living Tradition in Kilmarnock has contacts all over the country and all over the world and its staff have a practically infinite knowledge of traditional cultures and how they are best preserved and promoted. We should be listening to those people, rather than always seeking top-down solutions.</p><p>Robert Burns was a man of the people. His legacy is maintained by folk from all walks of life. I ask both East Ayrshire Council and the Scottish Executive not to be \"wee, sleeket, cowran tim'rous\" beasties, but to lead on the project to restore the Burns monument in Kay park, first through a commitment to save it and, secondly, by listening to those people who can provide ideas and enthusiasm for its future use and its place on the Ayrshire Burns trail.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13331963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Robert Burns National Heritage Park"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am pleased that Adam Ingram has secured the debate because, as Margaret Jamieson said, it allows us to examine the wider aspects of Burns's legacy.

It is a worthwhile debate and it would be worth having if we had any huge improvements to report or any big initiatives to announce. I am not convinced that that is the case today and I am disappointed because I hoped that it would be.</p><p>It strikes me that all the discussions and debates that we have about this subject are about changing baselines and involve a bit of obfuscation. However, having said that, I will try to be fairly constructive.</p><p>We started off with the minister telling us about 100,000 children being lifted out of relative poverty since the 1997 baseline. If I remember rightly from way back, we started out with a 1999 baseline for relative poverty. That was changed and, suddenly, the figures started to look better. There was a bit of obfuscation at that time. We now consider absolute poverty in relation to a 1997 baseline, which makes things look good because, if I remember rightly, we were told that 47 per cent of children have been lifted out of absolute poverty. However, when we consider that the figure was based purely on the 1997 baseline with retail prices index increases, I suggest that it is pretty meaningless.</p><p>We used to have 29 milestones with subsets of targets that were measured each year and published in the social justice annual report. The last report was in December 2003, so I ask the minister to let us know when we can expect the next one.</p><p>Now, we have six objectives and 10 targets. I would like the minister to explain to me and others what the benefits of the change in the method of measuring and monitoring have been. Can he assure my colleague Brian Adam, who asked, that he is confident that he can justify the monitoring and measurement of the new targets to the satisfaction of the Opposition parties, which exist to hold the Executive to account?</p><p>The minister went on to speak about concrete policy decisions and actions, but the only points that he made were about Johann Lamont's financial inclusion action plan. That is fine, but it is all very familiar&#8212;I seem to have heard it all before. In reannouncing the measure, I wonder why we have not been told how much has been achieved by the plan that Jackie Baillie put in place, I think, when she was minister. That plan incorporated the credit union initiatives that Donald Gorrie mentioned. Where are we on that and has there been an improvement?</p><p>Employment initiatives have been spoken about. That is fine, but work is no guarantee of alleviating <place-holder colnum=\"13610\"/> poverty if there are no wages. Someone can still be in poverty when they are working. That goes back to what Sandra White said about the benefits trap.</p><p>An initiative that was taken to alleviate poverty among disabled members of our society was the new deal for disabled people. According to the Capability Scotland briefing that we received today, Government research shows that such schemes are not achieving their aim. For example, in two and a half years, less than 20 per cent of those new deal participants have gained and sustained employment. Why have we not heard about that? As I have said, we must measure and monitor these matters.</p><p>Whatever we disagree on, we can at least agree that people have basic needs and that poverty will be alleviated if those needs are met. I have mentioned employment; as far as health is concerned, I point out that the premature death rates in 29 of the 32 Scottish local authorities are higher than the average for England and Wales.</p><p>We can alleviate poverty and give people quality of life through the provision of housing. However, we heard today that 150 housing developments in Glasgow have been put on hold because of poor water infrastructure. Such an example shows that everything to do with poverty is cross-cutting and that every policy must be poverty proofed. The minister must reassure us on this matter. Are departments working with each other to consider every way of alleviating poverty or are they considering the matter in isolation, even if they do not mean to? Again, I return to the issue of monitoring and measuring.</p><p>I end by asking members to support the SNP amendment. As Christine Grahame pointed out, even the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested that a modest redistribution of wealth is required. Without parliamentary powers over macroeconomic, tax and benefit matters, we might make small progress and take baby steps towards helping some people in some pockets of our society, but we will not achieve the ultimate aim of eradicating poverty for everyone unless we have the means of doing so.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13331387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Closing the Opportunity Gap"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Christine Grahame said, we have had this debate three times before.

Other members have referred to the lack of response from the Executive to letters that they wrote&#8212;I had the same experience.</p><p>The extent of the abuse that we are debating first came to my notice when people in my area contacted me after reading a <em>Sunday Mail</em> article in June 2003 in which the First Minister said that he had ordered a study of the Irish model of addressing institutional child abuse to find out how such issues could be addressed in Scotland. That was followed up by nothing. It was well over a year before the issue got going. With respect, I suggest to the Executive that raising people's hopes that something will be done, then dashing them by not responding to letters and not even responding to a parliamentary committee is no way to conduct business.<place-holder colnum=\"12431\"/></p><p>Some of what the Minister for Education and Young People said was good news. I am glad that there will be meetings with INCAS; the dialogue must be kept up. However, I am concerned about a comment that was made about files. I am not a legal body, so I would appreciate clarification when the minister winds up. He said that some institutions had agreed to open files, some had already done so and others had agreed to engage in further dialogue to progress matters. Does that mean that some are saying that they will not open their files? Do we have a way of compelling them to open files and of urging apologies similar to the one that the First Minister gave today?</p><p>The minister and I attended a Public Petitions Committee meeting in September 2004. Although I was not a member of the committee, the convener allowed me to attend and to speak. The minister gave three reasons why he did not think that a public inquiry was the way forward. First, he asked whether an inquiry would prevent further abuse. We have heard a lot about that in the debate and there is unanimity in the Parliament and throughout society on the need to prevent as far as possible any abuse in future. However, that is not the issue; the issue is the survivors of institutional child abuse and their campaign for a public inquiry. The survivors are saying to us, \"You didn't listen to us then; please listen to us now.\" Secondly, the minister asked whether a public inquiry would help to meet the needs of survivors. He said that some people might prefer that the issues were not raised in public. There might well be such people, although I have not met or heard from any of them, but there might be many more who would be willing to come forward to tell their story if a public inquiry were held, because the fact that such an inquiry was being held would indicate that their experiences matter to the rest of us and that they are worth listening to. People's shame and guilt might be alleviated if their stories were validated through an open and public inquiry.</p><p>Thirdly, the minister said that there is public interest in the matter and that the public</p><p class=\"indent\">\"need to be reassured that such abuse cannot recur; that lessons have been learned\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, 29 September 2004; c 1049.]</p><p>However, the public must also acknowledge that abuse happened on a fairly horrendous scale. That is apparent from the cases of the people who have been brave enough to come forward, whose claims deserve to be validated. The public must know who those people are and what happened to them and the public must understand that they are ordinary people like you and me, who ended up in a situation that any of us could have ended up in. Sadly, there are appalling perceptions about those people. Someone once said that many of the kids in care were misfits and delinquents, and some <place-holder colnum=\"12432\"/> people believe that the claims are not true and that those who make them just want to make hay while the sun shines so that they will receive financial compensation.</p><p>We must say to the public that there was a collective failure of society to deal with the problem and that it is society's collective responsibility to acknowledge what happened, to recognise society's responsibility and to try to make reparation wherever possible. If the people who suffered think that such reparation could be provided in part by a public inquiry, the onus is on the Parliament and on Scotland to listen to them and to hold such an inquiry. I am not sure why people keep saying that an inquiry would be inappropriate. Public inquiries have been held in Canada, Australia and Ireland, so what is wrong with us? Why cannot we address the matter?</p><p>We have not heard the results of the study of the Irish model that the First Minister announced. What were its findings? Did they suggest that a public inquiry was not the right way forward for Scotland? If they did not suggest that, I, for one, believe that more must be done to justify not holding a public inquiry.</p>", "hdate": "2004-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13328378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Institutional Child Abuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I speak in the debate as a former member of the Public Petitions Committee who was there for part of the time that the long, sorry saga of the petitioners who seek to have their case recognised by Parliament was unrolling.

I also agree with the SNP amendment, two points in which I want to address. Point 1 is that research has found that one in five young men and one in 10 young women believe that violence against women is acceptable in some cases. We should all bear that horrifying statistic in mind.</p><p>Point 2 is the recognition that violence against women is an international issue, as Cathy Peattie eloquently outlined. Violence against women is not confined to any particular political or economic system, but is a phenomenon that cuts across boundaries of wealth, race and culture. Indeed, women's role in the world is based on a fundamental belief in societies of the non-importance of women compared with men. Indeed, the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women acknowledges and confirms the basic tenet that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men.\"</p><p>The use of women as a weapon of war, in either internal or international struggles, is a monstrous manifestation of that unequal power relationship and of gender violence. There are far too many examples, but I will cite just a few. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, there has been systematic rape and torture of at least 40,000 women and girls during the past six years of civil conflict. In Darfur in Sudan, girls as young as eight are among the victims of mass rape and women as old as 80 have been taken hostage and used as sex slaves. It is estimated that, during the genocide in Rwanda, up to 0.5 million women were subject to rape, including gang rape, sexual torture and mutilation. The cross-party international development group of the Scottish Parliament was privileged to hear recently from a Rwandan lady who told us of her experiences and of the staggering facts about HIV and AIDS in her country&#8212;seven out of 10 of the abused women are now suffering from that condition. A recent <place-holder colnum=\"12348\"/> Amnesty report states that, although we are 10 years on from the Rwandan genocide, prosecutions have been few and far between. That is an indictment of not just that country, but us all.</p><p>However, the issue is not all about Africa, a distant continent. Closer to home, in eastern Europe, the world witnessed the same kind of violence towards women as a weapon of war. Similarly, we continue to see trafficking, as Pauline McNeill, Shiona Baird and Rosie Kane mentioned. Indeed, at times trafficking is, sadly, perpetrated by those who are expected to protect the women. The SNP supports all initiatives to address the issue and to support the victims.</p><p>The on-going effects of mass violence are beyond the imagination of any of us. No matter what happens to women anywhere in the world, they have to get on with life; they have to cook, clean and raise the children, even where they are stigmatised by their societies because of circumstances that were way beyond their control.</p><p>I have seen some of the results for women who have had to live with such violence. I have friends in East Timor who suffered rape and sterilisation by external aggressors. In Peru, I was privileged to meet some of the victims of the civil war&#8212;community activists who were violated both by insurgents and by Government forces during the struggle simply because they were trying to improve the lot of ordinary people, as women do all over the world.</p><p>Cathy Peattie is right to say that Scotland should be playing a part in the global campaign to stop violence against women wherever it occurs. However, we can do that with any force and credibility only if we recognise and deal with our own culture of violence against women, in which one in five young men and one in 10 young women believe that violence against women is acceptable.</p><p>Elaine Smith and I are involved in a Tanzanian project with the British Council. The women MPs from Tanzania whom we meet are absolutely astounded when we talk to them about domestic violence in Scotland. They are amazed to learn that, in a country that they see as being democratic and forward thinking&#8212;Scotland's condition is something that they aspire to&#8212;people suffer from domestic violence to a degree that is not that far removed from the degree to which people in Tanzania suffer from it. We should be amazed as well and we should be doing everything that we can to support the Executive in what it is trying to do.

In Scotland, where ownership levels are rising higher than they are anywhere else in western Europe, we keep on going down the ownership route. At one point&#8212;it seems like many years ago&#8212;Wendy Alexander declared a housing ownership target for Scotland. Is that one of the few targets that the Executive has not abolished in the past few weeks?</p><p>I understand that there are people who want to own their own homes and I understand that that choice should be there. There is a need for low-cost home ownership initiatives, but I would like to see an initiative to ensure that low-cost home ownership properties would remain in perpetuity as low-cost home ownership properties, rather than the initial subsidy being lost and those houses ending up being sold at full market value. That can be done if the will is there. I look forward to seeing the fine detail of the minister's shared equity plans.</p><p>What finer example is there of the initial subsidy being lost than right to buy. That policy has been with us for some time and the provision of 5,500 affordable rented homes a year must be set against the on-going loss of 18,000 homes a year through right to buy. I find it interesting that Labour members are proud of the fact that they decreased the discounts for right to buy. That was quite good, but those members are the same people who extended the right to buy to take in post-1989 housing association tenants.

There is also a rush of housing associations applying for exemption through charitable status.

I welcomed the Executive's legislation on homelessness because it has admirable intentions, which I think that we all share. However, giving someone the right is not the same as giving them a house. Such aspirational rights must be resourced and I do not believe that that is happening adequately. Members have mentioned examples of that.</p><p>Two planks of Executive housing policy have an implementation date of 2012&#8212;that is eight years away. First, under the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003, every unintentionally homeless household will be eligible for permanent accommodation. Secondly, housing association tenants who did not previously have the right to buy will be given that right. I am concerned about the impact of those policy planks on the supply of affordable housing in Scotland in the long term. Is on-going research providing any steer on that? Is the target date of 2012 in the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003 likely to be met? After all, there are still families with children in bed and breakfast accommodation even though the previous Minister for Communities pledged regulation to end such use of B and Bs by the end of this year. Is that pledge on target?</p><p>Many members have discussed the infrastructure difficulties&#8212;and whether they are real or imposed&#8212;that are a strategic element of housing provision. I agree with Murray Tosh's view on the importance of housing market areas rather than reliance on local authority areas.

They are right to say that we require strategic direction on that, <place-holder colnum=\"11295\"/> as well as on the planning system in general. Although, as Murray Tosh said, housing associations and developers may sometimes fund, for example, sewerage provision beyond the needs of their own project, that should not be taken into account in the unit cost because it would have a direct impact on rents, which would rise very steeply to meet the costs of that infrastructure. I ask the minister to give full consideration to all those matters.</p><p>We are pushed for time, so I quickly mention the amendments. We cannot support the Conservative amendment, which talks about housing association tenants having \"greater rights\"; that is a basic error, because housing association tenants do not have greater rights. The Conservatives seem to be calling for an end to council housing and a full-scale stock transfer. We cannot cope with the current speed of transfers, let alone an acceleration.</p><p>We like most of the content of the Green amendment. We are a wee bit concerned about the amount of encouragement and praise that the Greens are piling on the Executive, but we agree with the broad thrust and ecological element of their amendment and we are minded to support it.

I took an interest in this project right from the start by asking parliamentary questions, writing letters to the Presiding Officer and so on. I felt instinctively that which was subsequently confirmed: this project was pre-disastered by the time it came to this Parliament, with a relentless rush to get on site with a done deal. Fraser said that construction management contracting was the single, most disastrous factor. All the risk is with the client unless there is proper preparation.</p><p>Much as I hate to, I have to disagree with John Home Robertson's analysis of why this particular construction management project went wrong. It was never going to work. As Fraser said, the wheels came off the wagon early. There was no preparation and no run-in time, and then the Government washed its hands of it.</p><p>Consider Sam Galbraith's testimony. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I knew the minute we handed it over to them the costs would go through the roof\".</p><p>That is hardly an endorsement of himself as a minister or of his MSP colleagues. That was Scottish ministers shrugging off responsibility and leaving the Parliament to cope with a disaster that was not of its making.</p><p>Of course, the spin machine has suggested that ministers were not aware of what was going wrong with the project from its earliest days. That is, of course, rejected by Lord Fraser, who confirms that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is an abundance of documentary evidence of <place-holder colnum=\"10472\"/> officials warning Ministers of the consequences of over-hasty decisions.\"</p><p>Why were ministers not listening? If they do not listen, it is easy for them to say that they do not know; it is a culture of plausible deniability. An editorial in <em>The Herald</em> today refers to it as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"not so much a climate of secrecy as a climate of cynical control of politics.\"</p><p>There has been much talk today about construction management. Although the decision to follow that route was apparently not referred to ministers, it is clear from the evidence of Lord Elder that Donald Dewar understood its importance. Lord Elder describes him as being \"seriously distressed\" at being unable to question the decision</p><p class=\"indent\">\"without impugning the integrity of his entire official team\".</p><p>He was certainly acting with honour to his staff, but what about the Parliament and the nation?</p><p>I tried to intervene on Helen Eadie when she spoke about Portcullis House and the inadequacy of the Tories in that construction management project. Should Labour have not learned from that and not rushed headlong into speeded-up construction management for the Holyrood project?</p><p>Fergus Ewing referred to the conduct of the Minister for Finance at that time&#8212;now our First Minister. Our First Minister has so far ducked all the questions about the 2 June 1999 meeting. Why did Mr McConnell take part in making a decision that he was not entitled to make? Was he aware of the construction management form of procurement and its risk implications? Why did he wait until the 2003 election campaign to announce an inquiry based on so-called new evidence, when that evidence was two years old at that time? If raising his game does not include accepting responsibility for his failure on 2 June 1999 to protect the interests and integrity of the Parliament and apologising on his own behalf, it stands condemned as no more than easy sloganising.</p><p>Beyond the Scottish Office debacle, I believe that Parliament made the wrong decision when it decided to carry on regardless rather than to halt to take stock&#8212;I said that at the time publicly, I said it to Lord Fraser and I repeat it now. It is ironic to read in the debate at that time that one of the reasons cited for not delaying was a potential cost of &#163;2 million to &#163;3 million. For George Lyon to try to tie in potential pause costs with subsequent delays is simplistic in the extreme. However, the decision was taken, despite the fact that I and others voted against it twice. Following that, the SNP group believed that it was up to all of us to try to achieve the best that we could under the circumstances. That is why we took part in the progress group. After all, we had a member on the <place-holder colnum=\"10473\"/> SPCB who had legal responsibility. That is why the Tories' position is so hypocritical: they had a member with legal responsibility who took part in the decision making, but no one at the front line taking the flak.</p><p>Today, I speak not as a member of the HPG, but for my party. However, I find it unavoidable to blur those lines. I am on record as being a supporter of Miralles's concept right from the start. I was pleased when Alex Salmond asked me to be the SNP representative on the HPG and, despite the flak, overall I do not regret the appointment. I was honest with Lord Fraser and admitted that, despite having some construction experience, I had a lot to learn&#8212;but let me tell the chamber, not nearly as much as some people in here have.</p><p>Perhaps the HPG made some mistakes. Perhaps some believe that we could have done better&#8212;I have always been open to discuss these issues with anyone. However, we have been dogged by much rumour, speculation and spurious ranting, some of which had no basis in reality. We recommended some savings, which were implemented, although I admit that they were minor in the greater scheme of things, which was already well under way.

Let us have some big thinking on that issue and a recognition that the system that is being used here is not working.

With the establishment of the Parliament and the Scottish Executive, we have had a wide range of new legislation and policy initiatives that are, by their nature, accompanied by a substantial volume of guidance and directives. A lot of that work has been in community care, but there is also a major development agenda in children and families services and criminal justice.</p><p>I had the pleasure of meeting people from a social work department in central Scotland the other day. I was interested to see the main headings of the kind of work that social workers now do and the responsibilities that they have. Under community care alone, they work with older people and people with dementia, with people who have learning disabilities, mental health problems, physical disabilities, impairments or acquired brain injuries, with children and young people who have disabilities, with people with addictions and, of course, with carers. A very wide range of services are now being provided under the heading of social work, and a review is required&#8212;it is probably long overdue&#8212;so I am very pleased that one will be carried out and I look forward to hearing much more about what it will involve.<place-holder colnum=\"9749\"/></p><p>I would like to make one point in particular. Scott Barrie touched on it when he said that we should never forget the fundamental principles of the 1968 act, when social work as we know it was set up to act on behalf of us all. When we hear about so many bad things happening in social work, we should remember that an awful lot of good work is also going on. We must not throw the baby out with the bath water, but take note of the good practice that exists and the great things that are already happening and we must try to build on them rather than start all over again.</p><p>The social work department that I visited was at North Lanarkshire Council and I was greatly impressed by its work, particularly that on supported living. That is the term that the department uses for its approach to enabling people with significant levels of disability to live in their own homes and communities&#8212;communities that they know&#8212;which allows them to maintain close connections with their families and friends. All those with whom the department works on supported living have individualised care packages and many of them receive 24-hour care in their own homes. What is important about that work is that it shifts away from the concept of fitting people into a service and towards designing services around the unique needs of the individuals. I was amazed to learn that, in North Lanarkshire, 250 people&#8212;the majority of whom receive 24-hour care&#8212;are in their own fully supported tenancies. Another side to that work is that the arrangements have generated more than 700 social care jobs.</p><p>The future growth of such work depends on resources. Some say that resources are not the only issue; of course they are not, but they are important because we need the resources to provide individualised care services such as that I mentioned. That is not only about redeploying existing resources to better effect, as many councils&#8212;including North Lanarkshire Council&#8212;are doing, because it is evident that need outstrips the available resources. We must take that on board.</p><p>Much good practice exists and we should build on it, but we must also monitor effectively. I am concerned about how the Scottish Executive monitors social work services because, if we measure outputs only in the short term, we are not really seeing the quality of service below that and it sometimes takes a long time&#8212;many years, in some cases&#8212;to produce the results for which we are supposed to be aiming. Therefore, I would like the ministers to consider how they monitor.</p><p>The minister mentioned joined-up approaches. I am confident that North Lanarkshire Council has a joined-up approach, and I hope that the Scottish Executive will review its own approach to social <place-holder colnum=\"9750\"/> work to ensure that it is joined up. Brian Adam mentioned that already. Who exactly is in control of social work? I am concerned, for example, about the supporting people fund. It is a great initiative, but there are concerns among practitioners that that funding will be cut, which could have a negative effect on the good practice that the initiative helps to bring about in the long term, which cannot be measured just by looking at the performance sheets and ticking the boxes on outputs. I know that that falls under the communities budget, even though the Minister for Education and Young People is talking about social work. I ask him to assure us that the Executive's approach is joined up and that all such matters are being considered in the round.</p>", "hdate": "2004-07-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13321750", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "What is clear from all the speeches is how social work has changed over the years.

That is important. I agree with everything that he said.</p><p>I want to remind members about the setting up of the United Nations, which happened for highly admirable reasons. I will read out a small extract from the charter of the United Nations. Paragraph 3 of article 2 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.\"<place-holder colnum=\"9633\"/></p><p>Many people in the world would do well to remember that statement.</p><p>Before I say any more, I will declare an interest. I am a member of the steering group in Scotland of the Network for Civilian Peace Services and a member of Peace Brigades International. That said, I state that I am not a pacifist. As Elaine Smith pointed out, it is too often the case that people who care about peace and who would like peace services to be expanded through education and through the way in which we act in society are written off as people who are a bit naive and who do not know what the real world is about. I am not a pacifist; I believe that a nation has the right to defend itself and I recognise that, now and then, there is a need for a proportionate response in particular circumstances. For me, the key is that such a response should be entirely within international law. There are other ways of resolving conflicts. I do not believe that we in this country have considered properly some of the issues that Chris Ballance talked about or thought about appropriate responses in all situations of conflict.</p><p>I will now plagiarise the work of Peaceworkers UK, because I could not begin to say things in a better way than it does. I recommend the document that is called, \"Tackling Violent Conflict: The Case for a UK Civilian Peace Service\", which has been put together by Peaceworkers UK, International Alert, Saferworld, the Electoral Reform International Service and RedR&#8212;Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief. It contains a quote from the former Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We know that force alone cannot create a stable society and functioning institutions. Yet the international community has lagged in deploying adequate civilian resources.\"</p><p>That is right. There seems to be a lack of recognition that it is possible to have all different kinds of organisations and forces&#8212;not necessarily military&#8212;that can complement each other in conflict situations. In addition to the military and the police, we have development agencies and humanitarian agencies. Other bodies, such as civilian peace services, can be added to that list. Civilian peace services are not about people throwing themselves in front of tanks or guns; they are about helping people who are in conflict to come together to find other ways of working out their problems.</p><p>The parties in a conflict are those who are most directly affected by it. Ultimately, they must be the ones who deal with the conflict. It is not good enough to have other people coming in to tell them what to do. Even though I have huge respect for UN peacekeeping forces, in many situations the people whom they are trying to help view them as a bit of an occupying force. I have heard people <place-holder colnum=\"9634\"/> say that they have been \"colonised all over again\" by United Nations peacekeepers.

The Scottish National Party supported that decision, because ending the practice of slopping out in our prisons is long overdue. It is inhumane and degrading and has no place in Scotland. After all, this is the 21<sup>st</sup> century and the penal system should seek to rehabilitate prisoners as well as punish them.

In my experience of working in tenement rehabilitation over the years, one of the hardest things to do was to work out who paid for what and how to get money back from people.

The old tenement law and the default mechanism that was used if the title deeds did not sort out the problem were inadequate, no matter how often people tried to come up with a definitive version in guidance.</p><p>The bill is welcome and has been a long time coming. I have moaned about that, but I realise that the matter is complicated. We have now produced a good basis on which to make progress.

To give my personal view&#8212;I have the benefit of a bit of experience&#8212;I would like the scheme to be firmed up a bit. I do not know about the legalities of the scheme because I am not a lawyer, but part of me thinks that it would be better if we made the scheme a statutory one that replaced title deed provisions.

I know that such a proposal has difficulties and I have read the committee's comments on the matter. I do not for one minute presume that I know better than the committee does because I did not hear the evidence. However, although it is difficult to impose a common insurance policy, it is also difficult to ensure that every individual in a tenement has appropriate insurance cover. As there are difficulties with both proposals, I would like the issue to be reconsidered. However, I welcome the fact that the bill insists that insurance must be for the reinstatement value rather than the market value.

The forces on the ground must be brought under UN command and must not remain under the command of countries that Iraqis view as invaders. Because it was committed to a war without a UN mandate, our military does not have <place-holder colnum=\"8771\"/> the legitimacy that it needs to win the peace and, sadly, the US military has lost all legitimacy. Bringing the current forces under UN command would be a start, followed by their phased withdrawal and replacement by forces that are not seen as invaders and colonisers.</p><p>Although the authority of the United Nations has been undermined by this war, it is the agency that should have international legitimacy. It is, after all, no better than the sum of its parts. We have to send out the message that the basic principles of the UN&#8212;the ones upon which it was formed&#8212;and its founding charter are still at the heart of our beliefs.

I also thank the First Minister for attending; I am glad he takes such an interest in Thistle Television.</p><p>We all know that John Logie Baird invented television, and that he was a Scotsman. There have been attempts to claim the invention for Marconi, who was an Italian. Of course, the long cultural interaction between the Scots and the Italians has led to some great achievements, and it is a well-known fact that the combination of Scots and Italians produces the very best of people. Nonetheless, television was the brainchild of a Scotsman, even if the BBC chose to switch to Marconi's system instead of using Baird's and television owes its existence to Scotland.</p><p>In my home county of Lanarkshire, we are still pioneering the growth of TV. Although it is a small beginning, there is at least one example of a local television station operating in Scotland. I am referring to the recently established Thistle Television, and I welcome some of its representatives to the Parliament.</p><p>Thistle Television is Scotland's only local television station and it has a potential audience of 400,000 people throughout Lanarkshire. The opportunity exists to make Thistle Television a pioneer for local TV in Scotland, leading the way for others to follow. I know that there have been other local television stations&#8212;such as Channel 6 Dundee and Lanarkshire TV, which previously covered Lanarkshire&#8212;but Thistle Television has <place-holder colnum=\"8728\"/> the chance to be a trail-blazer for local television. I hope that there will be an expansion of local services throughout Scotland.</p><p>What can local television offer? Community television can provide educational opportunities&#8212;local authority initiatives or projects involving local schools and colleges can be highlighted, promoted and supported via the local TV station. Community groups can have a conduit for their activities and community issues and campaigns can be highlighted. MSPs, MPs and local councillors could take advantage of a ready-made forum through which they could communicate with their constituents, although I must admit that not everyone might welcome that. Local news broadcasts can also be made. Moreover, local businesses can advertise their wares, products and services at a reasonable cost. They can also use their local TV station as a recruiting tool, as can job centres and other employment and recruiting agencies.</p><p>Local TV can and does offer the opportunity for local people, particularly young people, to learn a trade in the media industry&#8212;Thistle Television is already showing how that can work. Young people can use work experience or volunteering to assess whether the media would be a career choice for them as front-line reporters and presenters, technicians, writers, producers, editors, camera operators and a host of other jobs that we do not know anything about. Local TV gives people a fantastic chance to learn about an important communications medium from top to bottom.</p><p>Of course, in recent years, there has been an upsurge in media studies courses in our colleges. Would it not be great to have more opportunities for our graduates in the media in Scotland? Would it not be of great benefit to our communities to have such skilled people on our doorstep?</p><p>Many groups, organisations and individuals could take advantage of local television. Local television can be a force for the promotion of the well-being and attributes of communities, a place to air one's views and a means through which to tackle and deal with community problems. Earlier this afternoon, we debated national and local festivals. Those festivals could be covered by local TV, enabling people to have a sense of pride in their achievements. Perhaps the Executive would be willing to take the initiative in advising communities on how to go about setting up companies to run a local TV station.</p><p>I have a few concerns. The first relates to the funding of local TV stations. Under the Communications Act 2003, we now have the community media fund. However, the value of that fund has dropped dramatically from the initial proposal of &#163;25 million, through a revised proposal of &#163;6 million, to reach the current figure of <place-holder colnum=\"8729\"/> &#163;500,000. Most of that money is likely to go to community radio.</p><p>There is the option to sell advertising space. North Lanarkshire Council and South Lanarkshire Council have both been supportive in providing content for Thistle Television. However, I wonder whether there is scope for those councils to use some of their advertising budgets to support the station and whether the Scottish Executive might also consider supporting local television in that way. Local advertising campaigns could target specific issues in specific areas.</p><p>It is interesting that Channel M in Manchester is partly owned by the University of Salford. That could be a model to which our universities might look if the funds can be found. Northern Visions is funded in part by Belfast City Council and Channel 7 in Immingham is in receipt of European grants, which require matched funding.</p><p>My second concern is that the licences available for community TV are analogue licences. At first glance, that does not seem to be much of a problem, until one realises that the United Kingdom Government intends to start switching off the analogue signals. I grant that the deadline for that has been put back several times, but the phase-out process, which is due to begin in two years' time and to be completed by 2010, seems to be firming up. We must consider granting digital licences to community TV stations. I ask the minister whether he is willing to ensure that digital licences are available for Scottish community television stations.</p><p>My third concern is that the current licences for local TV stations&#8212;restricted service licences&#8212;last for only four years. BBC and ITV licences operate on a 10-year basis. In order to allow long-term planning by local television companies, the licence period for RSLs should be extended to the same 10-year period that is enjoyed by the big fish in the pond.</p><p>It is always useful to look at international examples. An example of the successful implementation of community TV is to be found in Denmark. The Danes began the process in 1983 when they broke up the monopoly of the national broadcaster, Danmarks Radio. Community TV has taken root in Denmark and there is now an almost national network of local TV stations. Sweden is also taking access television to its people, with support funding from central and local government.</p><p>There is now a national and international view that the medium of television has become too one sided and unidirectional under the control of large corporations and individuals. I believe that people want to take back some of the control. I want Scotland&#8212;the home of television, after all&#8212;to <place-holder colnum=\"8730\"/> become proactive in developing local TV stations. There seems to be no reason why we cannot do that. With the right encouragement, we might even find our local TV stations producing the kind of work that can be exported. I have faith in our creative abilities.</p><p>I hope that members and the minister will agree that Scotland has an opportunity that should not be spurned. We should be doing whatever we can to advance Scotland in this area of the creative industries. I hope that the minister will take some time to think about possible ways of helping to fund community TV in Scotland for the benefit of all our communities.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13319078", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Television"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take it all back.

In Central Scotland region, which I represent, three of the four local authorities are dominated by Labour in a way that does not begin to reflect the votes that are cast by the electorate.</p><p>The result of that, in one local authority in particular, is that senior local government officers shelter complacently behind seemingly immovable majority political groups. I refer to South Lanarkshire Council, which is dominated by a Labour group that has almost 80 per cent of the council seats elected on less than 50 per cent of the votes. Unfortunately, the culture of the local authority appears to be dictated by the chief executive and the other senior officers, who consider it their role to serve the interests of the ruling group rather than the common good.</p><p>As an elected member in Central Scotland, it is obvious to me that those executive officers find it difficult to conceive of their decisions ever being subject to scrutiny outwith the confines of the council's majority Labour group.

There is a clear case for certain defined workers, such as firefighters and ambulance workers, to be included in the provisions that we are discussing. There is nothing more abhorrent than a situation in which people who are going out to save lives find that their lives are being threatened. However, the matter becomes more complicated when we try to include everyone who provides a public service.</p><p>I note what the minister said about trying to introduce a specific offence of statutory aggravation and the difficulties that are encountered when an attempt is made to extend the legislation to include people beyond clearly defined emergency workers. I know that the matter will be more fully explored when any legislation goes through the committee stage. It is right that that should happen, as there are many views on the matter&#8212;we have all received lobbying papers from various trade unions, the British Medical Association and so on.</p><p>One issue that was raised made me think back to when I worked in housing some years ago. Sometimes, members of staff and I were threatened&#8212;quite severely on one occasion&#8212;by people who came into the office. We were not emergency workers, but we were providing a public service. What struck me today was that, once we had dealt with the situations, we did not report them to the police but simply talked about them with other people who worked in the same area. That happens a lot.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson asked what training people who have to deal with the public should undergo for dealing with such situations. The minister and, I think, Christine May mentioned public awareness. It needs to be made plain to the public that everyone has the right to go about their work in safety and that any kind of action against their safety will be severely dealt with.</p><p>Fergus Ewing, in his usual conciliatory way, <place-holder colnum=\"4936\"/> welcomed the guidance that the Lord Advocate has issued to procurators fiscal on dealing with and sentencing people who attack emergency workers. Stewart Stevenson asked whether the results arising from that would be monitored. I ask that we be given at least a view today on how things are proceeding in that regard and on whether the guidance is making a difference to sentencing.</p><p>Fergus Ewing also mentioned a report in the newspapers about the First Minister. That was a valid contribution. If the First Minister wishes to say that those reports are wrong, he should do as Fergus Ewing asks and publish the letter concerned, so that we can see it. Let us see that his letter did not say that the incident that Fergus Ewing described was a \"minor matter\", particularly given that the nurse in question was terrified and that the police time that was spent might have been better spent in other ways. If the First Minister implied that the incident was only a minor matter, let him at least apologise and admit that he got things wrong.</p><p>David Davidson made an excellent contribution about pharmacists. At a meeting with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain that I attended recently, the question of the safety of pharmacists came up. Obviously, pharmacists deal with members of the public all the time and the concern was expressed that, given the quite proper emphasis on community pharmacists and on the other services that are being offered, some staff in chemists' shops are being put at even greater risk. Everyone has been saying that there is much more to the issue than we might have thought when we started out with good intentions.</p><p>David Davidson asked whether there should be security staff&#8212;I think that he said on 24-hour cover&#8212;at accident and emergency departments in every hospital. That is worth considering, as is Alex Neil's suggestion that there should be enforceable rules about who is allowed to attend when somebody goes into casualty. I have not often been to casualty departments, but I remember once being in casualty in the early hours of the morning. The people who were sitting waiting for treatment, for their child to be seen or for their mother to come out were being intimidated by some of the characters who were coming in to wait for their pals. Margaret Jamieson was right when she told us that some people treat the occasion almost as an extension of their evening out and as a normal part of their social life.</p><p>I think that it was Margaret Smith who raised the important question of what happens after emergency workers or other public service workers are attacked and whether proper guidelines are in place on the need for counselling <place-holder colnum=\"4937\"/> and aftercare. That is another element showing how the issue is much bigger than it first looked when everyone started out down the line of creating legislation to deal with it. A lot of issues have come out this afternoon and I look forward to hearing the Lord Advocate's response.</p><p>I may have missed this, but I have not seen the timetabling for the proposed bill.

The trouble is that the Executive is stuck in the Home Robertson groove of arguing for the status quo and holds the misguided belief that activity is a substitute for achievement. It is not. The Executive tells us that it is busy in Europe and that it is succeeding, but if it does not tell us what it wants to achieve in the first place, how can we judge whether success has been achieved?</p><p>The trouble in Europe, generally, stems from the fact that Scotland is not properly represented. Only an independent Scotland will be truly represented and allowed to punch its weight. Even within the devolved settlement, the Scottish ministers do not relay the importance of what Europe means to Scotland. They do not relay that to the Parliament properly; therefore, it does not get relayed to the country.</p><p>It looks as though our lion rampant barely whispers, let alone roars. We hear tell of great co-operation with the UK, and sometimes we see the eventual results; the problem lies in between, when the Scots view may or may not be getting put forward. The Executive should ask any Scots fisherman whether he thinks that co-operation is worth a candle. I have with me a minute from the December fisheries council in which Ross Finnie is not even mentioned, although Mr George Pullicino, from Malta, is mentioned. From what Nicola Sturgeon said, we know that Malta, an accession state, is only the size of Edinburgh&#8212;it is nowhere near the size of Scotland.</p><p>Europe is not half as complicated as many politicians make it out to be, but they do that because it suits them. Generations of UK politicians have blamed Europe for anything unpopular that has happened. By error of omission, rather than deliberate intention, the Executive is upholding that unworthy British tradition. The Commission produces its work programme every year and updates it every three months to telegraph to member states and organisations what it is doing. The rotating presidency produces priorities for the same reason. The Executive tells us that it is at the heart of Europe, but we do not hear much else.</p><p>Let us look at the Commission's current work programme. List 1 contains 126 items, of which 68 clearly concern devolved competencies. List 2 contains 147 items, of which 52 clearly concern devolved competencies. Although the other proposals are not strictly devolved under the Scotland Act 1998, they are of considerable importance to Scottish policy. For example, the intention to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Follow up on the Innovation Policy Communication\"</p><p>has considerable relevance to the Executive's strategy for a smart, successful Scotland; however, the Executive has not published any <place-holder colnum=\"4854\"/> views on it.</p><p>I know that the Scottish ministers do not quite understand independence, but I sometimes think that they do not understand even devolution. Under the Scotland Act 1998, it is the job of the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Executive. That is impossible if we are given nothing more substantial than soundbites, platitudes, speeches&#8212;when forced&#8212;and press release after press release. The minister said that he intends much more information to be forthcoming in the future. Is he saying that there will be an annual report to the European and External Relations Committee on the Executive's intentions in relation to the Commission's annual work programme? I understand that that is what happens in the National Assembly for Wales. That is fundamental.</p><p>Some progress has been made. The forward-look document is useful, as far as it goes, but it is not quite enough. The Executive must go further. We need a European strategy that is built on the Executive's view of the Commission's work programme as discussed by the Parliament. For example, what are the minister's views on the Commission's plan to facilitate the roll-out of broadband? What are the minister's views on the Commission's plans to regulate on violence in the workplace? What are the Executive's plans for cracking down on vehicle emissions? There are hundreds of measures about which we should know the Executive's view, but we do not know what the Executive thinks of any of them.</p><p>Only with independence will Scotland be able to play a proper role in Europe.

The subject is huge and potentially affects everyone in the country, which means that there are varying personal opinions throughout society and among members. I am sure that every member who has spoken on the subject is representative of people who are not paid, as we are, to opine publicly on every subject under the sun. However, it must be borne in mind that there will be views out there that are not represented here, which is why the expert reference group was so important. I suspect, although I do not know, that some of the group's members were parents. That is another reason why wider contribution is important.</p><p>I am concerned that, as Shona Robison, Carolyn Leckie and Margaret Smith have mentioned, the minister has discounted emergency contraception prior to the full consultation. I was surprised that David Davidson welcomed that stance and then spoke about a hard debate being required, given that the point of going out to consultation on every aspect of the expert group's proposals is to allow us to have a hard debate and make decisions once we are fully informed.</p><p>I may touch on individual comments if I have time, but I was aware of themes emerging in the debate. One was the importance of the service being rolled out nationally. The minister emphasised the need for an holistic approach and mentioned the current lack of a strategic framework or coherent vision. Shona Robison and many others also stressed that point.</p><p>Mike Rumbles expressed the concern that the expert group has somewhat ducked the issue of provision through links between schools and clinical services. Des McNulty stressed the need for equality of access to services, both for treatment and for information and education. Patrick Harvie spoke of the recommendation that would place a requirement on NHS boards to make plans for improving links between schools and sexual health services, but mentioned that no reciprocal duty is recommended. Those are big questions about joint working and the stated objective of an integrated, holistic approach. Does the minister have any views about how we can ensure the required equality of access to education and information services? To come back to the subject of making hard decisions, I do <place-holder colnum=\"4792\"/> not for a minute suggest that that decision will be easy.</p><p>In a natural progression from that issue, I move to resources, which have been another main theme in the debate. The expert group stressed the importance of a consistent approach and of providing resources so that NHS boards can implement at least the initial stages of the strategy. The British Medical Association has expressed concern about the lack of clarity on resources.</p><p>Susan Deacon talked about muscle and money and spoke with some knowledge about how ministerial budgets are implemented and how they work. What struck me in what she said was the fact that no lobby group will fight for sufferers or send us letters about their problems with accessing sexual health services. Everyone has a responsibility to ensure that those people do not suffer because they do not shout loudly enough. That is crucial, because the matter affects everyone. Does the minister have an estimate of the problems that are faced and of the funding that the Executive is prepared to set aside to address those problems?</p><p>Other resource questions need to be discussed further. The Conservatives touched on the subject. I am not against having a tsar or an advisory committee. I am open minded and I look forward to the results of the consultation and to further discussion. However, we must be wary of increasing bureaucracy and stopping essential resources from reaching front-line services. That is a fine balance that we must get right.</p><p>The third theme was that of ensuring respect, including self-respect. Christine Grahame spoke about some teenage mums' lack of aspiration. We must work hard to ensure that self-respect and self-esteem are part of our education system, so that people have aspirations. People must also respect others, whatever their chosen sexuality. There should be no discrimination or stigmatisation.</p><p>On a lighter note, Cathy Peattie reminded me of a phrase that I had not heard for years. What she said was absolutely right. As a teenager, I probably even said, \"She's went and got hersel pregnant.\" I never thought of the matter in the way that Cathy Peattie described it before. That emphasises the joint responsibility of couples who have sex without condoms or who use no form of contraception.</p><p>For decades, our education has been lacking as it has always placed the responsibility for contraception on the girl and the woman. We must move away from that. We must say, \"It is 50:50. The bottom line, young man\"&#8212;or older man&#8212;\"is that if you do not wish to have a child or to take responsibility for bringing a child into this world <place-holder colnum=\"4793\"/> and for contributing to their upkeep, you wear a condom, regardless of whether the lassie tells you that she is on the pill.\" The man must take that responsibility. He cannot think for one minute that he can shirk it or run away from it.</p><p>Gosh&#8212;I did not realise how much time had passed. I thought that I would be pushed for time in my speech. I will state the SNP's position on the sexual health strategy. We agree absolutely that a strategy that is based on the principles of respect, self-esteem and equality is the right way to go. Above all, the individual should be empowered to make independent choices about their sexual health.</p><p>I will give a view that is more personal than party. I am concerned that we could portray the sexual health strategy as the Executive's right to tell people how to run their sex lives. Of course the Executive does not have that right. Nobody has the right to tell anybody else how to run their sex life. We should remember that people have the right to independent thought and that adults should be free to make their own decisions about sexual health and behaviour, provided that they do not hurt anyone else. We need truly to give people informed choices and to empower individuals to make the choices that are right for them.

The recommendations that it contains are those that have many of us have called for over the years, before and after the establishment of the Parliament, especially during the passage of the Housing (Scotland) Bill.

In fact, the issue goes back a couple of centuries, but a particular milestone was the creation of the housing action areas during the 1970s, with local authorities in the driving seat, particularly in Glasgow. That measure dealt with landlords in the private rented sector and owner-occupiers in areas where houses were falling into disrepair.</p><p>The minister spent much of her speech talking about the home ownership aspect of the private sector. She said that the level of home ownership <place-holder colnum=\"4710\"/> is increasing because of people's aspiration to own their homes. That cannot be denied, but I suggest that that aspiration has, over the past few decades, been forced by a lack of decent housing in the private rented sector and a lack of houses in the social rented sector&#8212;it has really been forced by the lack of choice. Somebody&#8212;perhaps Tommy Sheridan&#8212;mentioned the fact that young couples have no choice any more except to get on to the owner-occupation ladder.</p><p>Mary Scanlon spoke about the wonderful right to buy and the rush to purchase. I suggest that that was more about the huge discounts that were given to promote the aspiration to home ownership than it was about people fundamentally wishing to get on to the property ladder. I was a bit surprised that a Labour member&#8212;I cannot remember who it was&#8212;defended that position. Indeed, Labour extended the right to buy in the previous session to housing associations.

I was glad to hear the minister acknowledge that the report's recommendation on that would be accepted. Will she clarify whether that will cover individual properties in the private rented sector and whether the Executive will actively promote such a move?</p><p>That brings us back to the role of the local authorities. Earlier, I mentioned housing action areas and I notice that the task force's report recommends the introduction of housing renewal areas to equip local authorities with the ability to plan and promote better housing quality. Local authorities have, as an Executive publication noted, little systematic information on the private rented sector in their areas and tend not to concentrate on that sector, apart from in relation to revenue and housing benefit. Local authorities do not have a written strategy for the private rented sector. I want such strategies to be actively promoted. We should equip local authorities with the ability to deal properly and globally with all houses in their areas.<place-holder colnum=\"4711\"/></p><p>The minister also referred to encouraging and compelling owners. That must cover all owners, including owner-occupiers, private landlords and absentee owners, who are an important element of the private sector. Huge problems are often caused because absentee owners have either left their house vacant or rented it out to someone who just pays their rent every month but does not know who or where the landlord is. We must have firm processes in place and it is essential that local authority powers are beefed up for that.</p><p>We sympathise with Cathie Craigie's point about private landlords and the different elements of antisocial behaviour. Shona Robison said that she would like some aspects of the issue to be taken further. We look forward to the Communities Committee's proposals in that regard and we will monitor the situation closely.</p><p>Robin Harper and Rob Gibson firmly expressed their belief, which I share, that housing standards should be considered across the board. We should look at materials and specifications. We must stop saying&#8212;I am always going on about this&#8212;that the initial capital cost is what it cost to build a house. We must move away from an attitude that says that we can get 40 houses if we go down the cheapest route; we should say, instead, that we will have 36 properly equipped houses, because we have beefed up and implemented the standards. We must consider whole-life costs. Again, we should look at the example of Scandinavia.</p><p>Rob Gibson and Nanette Milne referred to planning and statutory agencies and the barriers that prevent the promotion of housing development in rural areas. That is a huge issue; people are not working together for the benefit of those who need the houses.</p><p>Tricia Marwick referred to the reduction in housing repair grants over the years. There is a big discussion about whether those grants should be means tested and whether they should be for the benefit of the individual or for the benefit of the greater good and of good housing stock for the future.</p><p>A couple of members referred to the elderly. It is sad that so many elderly people live in private sector properties that they cannot afford to keep up properly. That is where the great care and repair initiative comes in. Again, I hope that we look at that in the round.</p><p>We must be ambitious about the tolerable standard. The report contains some marvellous recommendations and an integrated approach is required on all fronts. There is an opportunity to be grasped, and we should grasp it with both hands. However, we need a timetable and a commitment of resources, so, although the SNP supports the <place-holder colnum=\"4712\"/> Executive motion, we also ask that members support the SNP amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308623", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcomed the changes and the cut in the discounts.

Indeed, I will do so largely because in the past week I attended the annual general meeting of East Kilbride Women's Aid group. It had been a couple of years since I last attended such a meeting and I was struck by the fact that, as other members have mentioned, those who work in the field of domestic violence and other agencies such as councils and the police recognise that there is more working together and that the Executive and the Parliament are very serious about the measures that they are taking to combat domestic abuse.</p><p>East Kilbride Women's Aid covers East Kilbride, Cambuslang and Rutherglen and has many referrals&#8212;mainly self-referrals&#8212;from women. However, I was rather bothered by a statistic that emerged from the AGM showing that, of the 173 requests for refuge places last year, 137 women and 190 children were turned away because of lack of space. I am sure that that situation is replicated throughout the country. As a result, I was interested by the Executive's announcement of its refuge development programme and on-going work on the issue. Such work is extremely necessary.</p><p>I draw the minister's attention to another matter that was raised at the AGM. I was going to write to the minister about it, but then thought that the debate was an apposite place to raise it. I should make it clear that I do so very much in the spirit of seeing whether we can do something about the problem.</p><p>South Lanarkshire Council quite rightly applied to the refuge development programme and received &#163;150,000 for two new refuges in the area. The local housing association was asked whether it could acquire the properties and said that it would see what it could do. I should point out that there is a lack of social housing in East Kilbride, but that is a whole other debate.</p><p>The housing association tried to reach an agreement with a developer about a development that was about to be opened. However, the development is quite small and the developer had already agreed to two units for the hospital discharge programme and a children's home and was not willing to agree to any more non-mainstream housing on the site. That kicked the idea into touch.</p><p>As neither the housing association nor the council had any other suitable properties, they looked into acquiring a couple of properties on the open market. The idea sounds fine, and it is great that that can happen, but they then hit the next problem, which was more to do with practicalities than with will&#8212;after all, everyone has the will to achieve this aim. The problem is that East Kilbride <place-holder colnum=\"3698\"/> has a very buoyant housing market. Because the money comes from public agencies, those agencies are allowed to acquire properties only at the district valuer's valuation. Houses in East Kilbride, especially those of the required size and type, sell for a lot more than the market valuation.</p><p>I suspect that the same thing is happening in other areas and I ask the minister to look into the problem. As I have said, I have no doubt that everyone involved has the will to establish these refuges. The money has been sitting there for almost two years and no housing has been acquired. Meanwhile, in one year, 137 women and 190 children are turned away for lack of refuge space. I ask the minister to look at that situation and see whether some pragmatism can be applied to help with the practicalities of what is a very good policy initiative.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13306010", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although I acknowledge Shiona Baird's point that   violence against women encompasses more than domestic abuse, I will, like Maureen Macmillan, concentrate on domestic abuse.

That is a precious, on-going commitment, and we should all deem it important.</p><p>The Equal Opportunities Committee recognised early on that the existence of the committee should not allow complacency among others. All members of the Scottish Parliament must share the responsibility for ensuring that the spirit of the Scotland Act 1998 is recognised and that policies and practices are put into place to enact that spirit. Therefore, the committee's report and its recommendations on mainstreaming equality will be crucial for spreading the commitment of the Scotland Act 1998 and the Equal Opportunities Committee across the Parliament and the Executive.</p><p>I would like all nine of the report's recommendations to be acted on. The equality guidelines that are recommended for use by all committees in their work will be extremely useful, as will the equalities checklist for lead committees. The training facility that the report recommends be taken on board by the SPCB would also be useful, because it is often those who believe most strongly that they do not require training who, in fact, need it most. If it were possible, I would go as <place-holder colnum=\"2222\"/> far as making training compulsory for everyone who is elected to, or works for, the Parliament.</p><p>Recommendations 7, 8 and 9 refer to monitoring, to which Christine May just referred. The monitoring refers to both parliamentary committees and the Executive. I would like the monitoring to be formalised so that progress and outcomes can be assessed. During the consultation exercise, Dundee City Council raised monitoring as a specific issue and noted that local authorities and other public sector bodies have to make progress reports on equality matters. The council asked why that should not apply to the Parliament. Why not indeed? Victim Support Scotland and Greater Glasgow Health Council suggested provision for a grievance procedure if a committee were felt not to have addressed equality issues adequately. Again, why not? Perhaps Cathy Peattie and the Equal Opportunities Committee can consider that in the future.</p><p>Recommendation 6 asks the Executive to include an overarching equality statement in all bills. The Equal Opportunities Committee has been pushing for that from day one, as I remember. However, the report includes a copy of a letter from the then Minister for Social Justice to the Equal Opportunities Committee, in which the minister stated that she thought it would be difficult to do what recommendation 6 wants. I hope that that matter is looked at constantly so that the recommendation can be met in the future.</p><p>I refer back to the definition of equal opportunity in the Scotland Act 1998 as it is reflected by the committee's recommended definition of mainstreaming. Sadly, we know that discrimination exists in every category that is mentioned in the act's definition. For example, it exists in relation to gender, about which much has been said in the debate; marital status; the rights of cohabitees; race; disability; age; and sexual orientation&#8212;the list goes on.</p><p>The report's introduction quotes the Council of Europe paper on gender mainstreaming:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The greatest hurdle ... can be the absence of political will.\"</p><p>I believe that most members of the Parliament have the political will, but I am not personally convinced that without the statutory powers from equal opportunities legislation we can make the necessary difference in the foreseeable future. It is possible to have that right to legislate in a devolved settlement&#8212;the Northern Ireland Assembly has it. After all, many of the discrimination issues that have been mentioned in the debate relate to reserved matters.</p><p>I welcome the report and I will work towards its implementation, but I am seriously concerned that <place-holder colnum=\"2223\"/> it may be an uphill struggle. Marlyn Glen referred to hearts and minds. How long will it take before we see results? I feel that it is necessary sometimes to do more&#8212;for example, to be aggressive in making demands for what is right. To paraphrase an old saying, grab them by the nose and the hearts and minds will follow.</p>", "hdate": "2003-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13302327", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mainstreaming Equality"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scotland Act 1998 defined equal opportunities as \"the prevention, elimination or regulation of discrimination between persons on grounds of sex or marital status, on racial grounds, or on grounds of disability, age, sexual orientation, language or social origin, or of other personal attributes, including beliefs or opinions, such as religious beliefs or political opinions\".

One of them sticks out for me: her emphasis on ensuring that we include the traditional arts in our national theatre. That is extremely important. Only <place-holder colnum=\"2157\"/> a couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport and I had a wonderful evening together participating in some of Scotland's traditional arts. However, I suspect that that was not nearly as much fun as what Maureen Macmillan and the minister will share later.</p><p>It is important that the national theatre takes on board the point that it should represent all the languages and cultures within Scottish society. For example, with reference to my own background, lots of immigrants from Italy have settled in this country and have brought with them a love of opera. I would say that Italian opera is certainly the best in the world. I think that Colin Fox might agree with me, as he is a big opera buff. We have many cultures in Scotland and we should reflect those within our national theatre set-up.</p><p>Another point that Roseanna Cunningham made and that other members have mentioned is the fact that theatre can happen anywhere; it does not have to take place on a stage or in a building. When Roseanna spoke about the production of \"The Enchanted Forest\" that she is going to, it reminded me of a production that I went to in Glen Lyon a couple of years ago, called \"The Path\". I do not know whether any other members went to it. It was a wonderful experience&#8212;one of the best theatrical experiences that I have had in my life. That was theatre that took place right through the valley of Glen Lyon.</p><p>Unfortunately, I did not hear all of Jamie McGrigor's speech&#8212;it is not that I walked out on Jamie; I just did not want to drown his erudition with all my coughing. However, I understand from what some members have said that he was a bit ungracious. I certainly think that Brian Monteith was a bit ungracious in his closing remarks, which is so unlike him. Before I left the chamber, one comment I heard Jamie McGrigor make was his little dig at the Holyrood building. The Conservatives seem to have a little dig at it every time they get on their feet these days.</p><p>Donald Gorrie said that we should perhaps consider the Holyrood building as a venue for theatre. I have also considered that idea. Rob Gibson mentioned that he saw a production of \"Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis\" in this chamber.

How right the council was.</p><p>We were all told that Dungavel House was to be a halfway house and a holding centre for those who were in danger of absconding and those who had reached the end of the legal process and <place-holder colnum=\"1605\"/> would be deported in a matter of days. That was a lie.</p><p>The Home Office even changed Dungavel's name from detention centre to immigration removal centre. However, the Home Office did not change the profile of those who are sent there, sometimes for months on end. They consist of people who have not reached the end of the legal process and&#8212;as we have all known for two years&#8212;families with children. I understand that no family has been detained in Dungavel because they absconded. Families have been taken from their homes and communities and placed in detention while their cases continue. Dungavel is not an immigration removal centre&#8212;it is a jail.</p><p>While we hold this debate, Bushra Sharif&#8212;a Pakistani national&#8212;is at a bail hearing. She was granted asylum because she suffered serious marital violence; she was living in Bradford, but she was removed to Dungavel because her husband reported her for giving wrong information at her original hearing. At that hearing, she had not explained that, as a Pakistani national, she had been living in Kuwait. She did not do so because she was frightened that her violent husband would be able to trace her. The fact that her life was in danger is not in dispute, so why were she and her children locked up in Dungavel? Was it because of the fear that she would abscond with her three children, who are aged one, six and seven? Why on earth are we locking up such young children? Why does our country choose to do that when laws in countries in mainland Europe do not allow the detention of under-age children? Some other countries set an age limit on the detention of children.</p><p>There are alternatives to detention, but separating families by taking children away from their parents and putting them into foster care is not an acceptable alternative to the Scottish National Party. Such a proposal is no more than conscience salving for those who do not want to vote for our motion, which says that we should not imprison children. The so-called fear of families absconding is no more than scare tactics, which pander to the worst elements and aspects of our society.</p><p>Many families over the piece have been granted bail and have gone to live with guarantors in their homes. Some families have since been deported and some have been given leave to stay in Scotland. However, the country is not full of wandering families who hide in ditches and jump into hedges whenever anybody passes by. Surely there is no member who is duped by that kind of rhetoric. Surely there is no member who does not believe that it is worse to lock up dozens of children than to take the slim chance of somebody absconding.<place-holder colnum=\"1606\"/></p><p>A church publication recently undertook a study that showed that one of the main reasons given by asylum seekers for coming to the UK was that the UK believed in human rights. We all like to think that that is true. Tony Blair certainly harps on about the UK's belief in human rights when it suits him. However, people can talk all they like but it is actions that count. David Blunkett's actions leave me deeply ashamed to be part of the collective responsibility for what is happening in our country.</p><p>We are all collectively responsible, in this democracy, for detaining children in Dungavel House, ignoring the UNHCR guidelines on persons under 18, refusing to ratify article 22 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and refusing to honour agreed European directives. Even if the least that any of us can do is protest, we should do so. If we can do more&#8212;I believe that the Executive can&#8212;we should do so. Belief in human rights is not a reserved matter and neither is morality.</p><p>When I first heard about the Liberal Democrat amendment, I thought that it might be a step in the right direction. However, after closer reading, I now believe that that amendment does no more than talk the talk; there is no guarantee at all that it will walk the walk. Two aspects of the amendment, to which Elaine Smith referred, stick out. One is the part that states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Decisions affecting children whose parents are to be detained should be made in the best interests of the child\".</p><p>However, that would leave the door open for children to be taken from their parents and placed in foster care. Who would decide that? It could be the Home Office. I am sorry, but I trust nothing that the Home Office does in relation to immigration and asylum, because it has made too many mistakes and done too many bad things.</p><p>The other relevant part of the amendment refers to ending</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a system of detention of children at Dungavel which denies them access to social contact and to educational and other services in the local community\".</p><p>It would be unacceptable to have children taken from Dungavel to a school, only for them to have to say to their friends at the end of the day, \"You might be going swimming, but I am going back to jail. You might be going away for the weekend, but I am going back to jail for the weekend. I don't really know why, because my parents have not committed any crime. It's because the Government of this country says I should.\" I would not find such a situation acceptable and I hope that the Parliament does not find it acceptable.

What has been said about the flies is true and I am amazed that Alex Johnstone is such an expert on them. I was going to ask what happens when it is decided that the problem comes from a landfill site, but Alex Johnstone kindly answered that question. It is not only the people in Stewartfield who experience such difficulties; other people who live beside the Cathkin landfill site have a terrible time.

I hope that the joint initiative involving Glasgow City Council and South Lanarkshire Council identifies the source of the problem and fixes it.</p><p>Transportation is a significant issue, as three Glasgow City Council waste lorries have already been overturned on the way to the Cathkin landfill site. That brings me on to the ships that transport toxic waste. It is all very well to say that such waste has to be dealt with somewhere, as Alex Johnstone said, but our Government and, to an extent, our Parliament is charged with protecting our environment. It is worrying that we first learned about the ships bringing toxic waste through the Pentland firth from reading about them in a newspaper. I am sure that the minister will be as concerned as I am about that. I ask him to give us some feedback on how we can monitor such matters. The ships in question come from America.

Scotland needs to attract immigrants, and the SNP considers there to be a need now for a positive inmigration policy for Scotland. As one of the wealthiest countries in the world, Scotland should also be looking to play a full part in alleviating suffering here and elsewhere. I would like Scotland to play a full and active role in welcoming asylum seekers, first because it is right and secondly because their presence would add great value to our country. That is why I despair at the way that asylum seekers are treated here&#8212;not by their neighbours, because Scots generally welcome anyone who comes here. Sadly, it is the UK Home Office's draconian policies and intentions that are very much at odds with the sentiment in Scotland, in this chamber and elsewhere.

There has been much argument about whether the coalition in Scotland will or will not lock up the parents of antisocial young people, but in this country we are locking up both young people and parents, where no crime has been committed. There can be no moral basis for that from a country that signs up to many&#8212;but unfortunately not all&#8212;of the United Nations conventions on children and young people.

The minister also said that nobody should have to live on less than the state pension and the minimum income guarantee. However, Sandra White rightly <place-holder colnum=\"20073\"/> said that the existence of the minimum income guarantee is proof that the pension is not enough to live on. Furthermore, there is a big problem with people not applying for the minimum income guarantee and not taking up their full benefits.</p><p>Another member&#8212;I cannot remember whom&#8212;referred to the fact that there are local initiatives that involve giving people welfare benefits advice. For example, I think that the Eaga Partnership does that when its staff visit people for the central heating programme. We should consider giving such advice nationally. We should be able to tie all the different initiatives into the fundamental question of whether people have enough money to live on; it should not be difficult to include that in every initiative for older people.</p><p>The minister made it sound as if the land of milk and honey had arrived during the past four years, but I am sure that she would be the first to admit&#8212;Bill Butler referred to this&#8212;that we still have a long way to go. I agree that changes have been made, but it is a sad indictment of our society that we still have a long way to go.</p><p>Free personal care was referred to. I am extremely proud of the fact that it was the Parliament rather than the Executive that forced the issue on free personal care. Everyone in the Parliament has something to be proud of in that respect. However, there are problems with free personal care, which Mary Scanlon highlighted. She was right that we have all had constituency problems involving free personal care not working in the way that everyone thought that it would and, indeed, in the way that Parliament intended it to work.</p><p>Transport and travel were also referred to. Kenny Gibson and I were curious about why Lewis Macdonald rather than Des McNulty will close the debate for the minister, but we were not long into the debate when we realised why. Members started to let slip the fact there was to be a big announcement on national concessionary travel&#8212;I think that Dr Sylvia Jackson eventually blew the gaff and stole Lewis Macdonald's thunder. Again, I think that the provision of national concessionary travel is a triumph for a viable Opposition and the Parliament because the Executive has been forced to admit that the localised concessionary travel policy has not worked and that concessionary travel must be rolled out nationally. I look forward to hearing the proposal's being formally announced.</p><p>Keith Harding said something important when he said that what elderly people require is to be treated with dignity rather than to be patronised. I tried to imagine anyone trying to patronise my colleagues Kay Ullrich and Winnie Ewing; if someone did try that, I think that they would be quickly told something. Keith Harding also showed <place-holder colnum=\"20074\"/> a bit of a nerve in saying much of what he said about what the Tories did in their years in Government, but there was also much truth in what he said; for example, about stealth taxes on pensioners and the raid on pension schemes. Those were valid points on matters that are storing up big problems for the future.</p><p>Mr Harding also went on about the how the right to buy was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to alleviate poverty, but he will not be surprised to hear that I do not agree.

I welcome the idea of an emergency suicide hotline.</p><p>At the time, I welcomed the Executive's national strategy and action plan on suicide. I still do, and I hope that the minister will consider expanding it to incorporate some of these proposals and accept the national hotline as an idea that should be developed.</p><p>The two-day debate on the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Bill, which was very welcome, highlighted the lack of psychiatric services. I think that the story that Irene Oldfather has just told is probably all too common. This morning, I phoned a partner nurse to ask about her experiences in this respect. I was horrified to learn that there is a real problem with 15-year-olds. Some hospitals will consider providing child psychiatric services to children who are 14 and under, but will provide adult psychiatric services only to those who are 16 or over. As a result, there is a lost year in which someone who might be crying out for help cannot access it.</p><p>The nurse also told me about the case of a teenager who, when she tried to access urgent psychiatric services, was asked, \"Is it really urgent or can it wait a couple of weeks?\" If someone is suicidal, the matter is urgent; it cannot wait.</p><p>We obviously have a statutory obligation to help people in such a situation. As Donald Gorrie pointed out, however, we must also recognise the contribution of the voluntary sector in that respect. Some marvellous things are happening in that sector to help people with their problems. For example, Kenny Gibson mentioned Stresswatch Scotland in Kilmarnock. I am a patron of that organisation and have been impressed by how their networks go out into local communities. Its support work is very much carried out at ground level by volunteers.</p><p>Another approach that I want to mention is a bit more innovative. Theatre NEMO&#8212;which was set up by Isabel McCue, and developed by her, her son Hugh and Tricia Mullen of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship Scotland&#8212;is a theatre group that is dedicated to helping people who have been affected by mental health problems. It is all about participation in the arts as a means of stimulation, self-help and building self-esteem. About 40 people and, importantly, their carers attend meetings of the organisation, and the amazing thing is that the shyest of people&#8212;those who really do not want to participate in life&#8212;participate fully in drama and the arts and become very descriptive when they are on stage. It is a <place-holder colnum=\"19849\"/> wonderful way of building people's esteem.</p><p>South Lanarkshire Health Board has recognised the value of such an approach and has asked Theatre NEMO to put on two short plays at a forthcoming health board seminar. Perhaps when we come back to the next Parliament, we should think about how the performing arts can directly benefit communities. Certainly we should encourage such an approach. I should add that the company has recently received an equipment grant from the communities fund, which is good news. Another important point that Isabel McCue made is that, because Theatre NEMO is not seen as a mental health project, it does not have the kind of stigma that would stop many people attending.</p><p>Kenny Gibson's motion is worthy of support. Indeed, I ask the minister to support it. We took a big step forward today with the passing of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Bill.

However, I wonder a wee bit about the Executive's commitment&#8212;after all, four years down the line and four social justice ministers later, we do not yet have a bill on charity law reform to look at. Way back in 1999, the then Minister for Communities, Wendy Alexander, pledged to reform charity law in Scotland. However, after the McFadden report, it was an inordinately long time before the Executive responded properly.</p><p>Charity law reform is a social justice issue&#8212;it is interesting that social justice ministers have spoken about it and that the Social Justice Committee has been pushing it. Hugh Henry should not take this point personally, but I am concerned that the issue is now under the justice remit&#8212;last week in the chamber, Jim Wallace answered questions about charity law reform. That worries me, because the ethos of each portfolio and department is different. The social justice ethos is, \"We can do this and we want to do it, so how are we going do it?\" I often feel that the justice ethos is, \"Why can't we achieve this?\" I worry that that has held things up.</p><p>Another issue that could have held up reform is the on-going problem that we have with the authorities that deal with the voluntary sector. The amount of knowledge and expertise within the voluntary sector and the fact that people in the voluntary sector can run the agenda themselves are sometimes not recognised. That is down not so much to members of the Parliament or ministers&#8212;I do not doubt for a minute that our social justice ministers have all recognised the value of the voluntary sector&#8212;as to officials, who sometimes have a problem with recognising those facts. I talk from experience, having worked for a voluntary organisation. I know that there is a perception that people who work for voluntary organisations or charities are not right up there in knowing how to move forward&#8212;they are perceived as a bit wishy-washy. I would like ministers to take that problem on board.</p><p>There is an on-going example of that problem. I notice in the Executive's response to the McFadden report that the Inland Revenue charities register will be overhauled and reviewed, so that charities that no longer exist are removed from it. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations has taken such an approach for 10 years, with its charities register in Scotland database, which is constantly updated and as a result is the most modern and up-to-date register of where charities are at in Scotland today. Why cannot we use that? Why cannot the Executive say, \"The information is there; we don't need to <place-holder colnum=\"19721\"/> waste time or money on doing another survey of the Inland Revenue register\"? I ask the minister how much that will cost, how long it will take and whether the process will delay reform yet again.</p><p>I have two quick points to finish. Can we get the ethos of social justice back into charity law reform? Can we all make the commitment that, no matter who is in the Executive after 1 May, charity law reform will be a high priority on everybody's agenda?</p>", "hdate": "2003-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13295312", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Charity Law Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like my colleague Tricia Marwick, I did not sign up to Jackie Baillie's motion.

As a result, members will understand if I speak particularly of Strathaven. My colleague Mr John Swinney will talk more about Aberfeldy.</p><p>Quite simply, fair trade is trade that gives a better deal to those who produce the goods. It is a way of trying, despite heavily stacked odds, to make globalisation work for the poor and to reduce poverty. More than 500,000 workers in developing countries already get a better deal from fair trade through the Fairtrade Foundation. The use of the Fairtrade mark shows consumers that they are buying goods that in some measure challenge the conventional model of trade and offer a sustainable future for the producers.</p><p>Four and a half million growers and their families in 36 countries participate in fair trade and their goods are sold in 17 countries across Europe, north America and Japan. At this point, I had hoped to introduce Comfort Kwaasibea and Rijayatu Razak from a cocoa-producing farm in Ghana. However, I see that they have not managed to make it to the debate. I hope that members will be able to meet them, because they are touring the country during Fairtrade fortnight and visiting venues where Divine chocolate is sold.</p><p>Of course, Divine chocolate is only one of more than 100 food products with the Fairtrade mark that we can enjoy. People can find the label on <place-holder colnum=\"19223\"/> coffee, tea, cocoa, chocolate, sugar, honey, biscuits, cakes, fresh fruit and juices. The Fairtrade Foundation continues to work hard to expand the product range for coming years.</p><p>Sales of food with the Fairtrade mark are rising dramatically. Some &#163;46 million was spent in the United Kingdom on Fairtrade foods in 2001-02&#8212;that is an incredible &#163;1.50 spent per second. Since 1999, understanding of the meaning of the Fairtrade mark has doubled from 12 per cent to 24 per cent. The UK performs very well with regard to fair trade; it is now the second largest fair trade market in the world. I am pleased that Strathaven and Aberfeldy are now playing an active part in that.</p><p>I first had the idea of Strathaven's potential as a Fairtrade town when I heard that Garstang had been declared England's first Fairtrade town. I want to put on record my thanks to Bruce Crowther of the Garstang group, who was very helpful. It was not long before the initial informal steering group organised a public meeting to test support for the initiative in Strathaven. I thank Oxfam for helping us to organise that. We got that support from the community and the movement has grown at a tremendous rate.</p><p>Many groups and individuals must be thanked for their support. The local churches, which had already been holding an annual Traidcraft fair, have been highly supportive of our initiative. I particularly thank the office bearers of the group. Paolo Quadros, the chairman, is a Brazilian chap whose enthusiasm knows no bounds. Without that driving force, we would have been hard pushed to reach our target of being Scotland's first Fairtrade town along with Aberfeldy. I thank Sandy Grant, who has retired from teaching at Strathaven Academy and is Oxfam's local representative in the town. Again, he has been instrumental in driving the project, along with lots of local primary and secondary school children. I also thank Margaret Morton, a local businesswoman, who is our secretary. She works extremely hard to get the word over and to raise support.</p><p>I mentioned the rising support and I was particularly pleased that the seven primary schools in Strathaven took part in our schools project for Fairtrade. On Saturday we held an exhibition and a poster competition, to which we had 180 entries. The level of understanding of fair trade among those primary 6 and 7 pupils was outstanding. Some of the pupils at Strathaven Academy are also working on Fairtrade projects.</p><p>None of that would have been possible without South Lanarkshire Council, which has backed the Fairtrade initiative right from the start. I particularly want to thank Councillor Jim Malloy, who gave us much support from the outset, as did Councillor Chris Thompson and Councillor Eddie McAvoy, <place-holder colnum=\"19224\"/> the leader of South Lanarkshire Council.</p><p>Strathaven town has seven entrances, all of which say \"Welcome to Strathaven, Scotland's first Fairtrade Town with Aberfeldy\". We want to sustain Strathaven's Fairtrade status and to make sure that there are on-going events in Strathaven to promote that. Of course we will always have our major exhibitions and initiatives during Fairtrade fortnight.</p><p>The issue is not just about worldwide fair trade. There is also a local element. We are trying hard to make the link with Strathaven's farming traditions and use of local produce. As far as I know, we are the first Fairtrade group in Britain to include in its constitution support for local farming. The principle of fair pay for work applies as much to producers in Scotland as it does to producers anywhere else.</p><p>There are many different ways in which to change the world and to challenge the ways of the world. I feel that a commitment to fair trade throughout our country is one way of doing so. I hope that others will follow our initiative. While the developed world is talking about war, there are organisations and people all over the country whose principles and ethics have the potential to change the human condition across the world. I believe that those who are contented with their lives, have enough work and are fairly paid for that work have no real interest in going to war and killing other people.</p><p>I will finish with a quote that sums up everything that I want to say. At a time when we are sending &#163;35 billion in aid to poor countries that lose &#163;500 billion in unfair trade practices, I will quote the words of Isa&#237;as Martinez from Mexico, who says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We do not need charity, we are not beggars.

The minister started by giving some facts and a vision of what we should be trying to achieve this year and afterwards. That leads me to the Madrid declaration, which members such as Helen Eadie, Michael Matheson and Trish Godman have mentioned. Between them, Trish Godman and Michael Matheson said everything that I wanted to say&#8212;they covered the issue exceptionally well.<place-holder colnum=\"18903\"/></p><p>I have enough time to deal with only some of the Madrid declaration's vision, which is huge.

Benefits should be looked at and we should push people to consider further use of the disability living allowance, for example, to help towards that vision.</p><p>Another important part of the vision is moving</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Away from a focus on merely individual impairments ... and Towards removing barriers, revising social norms, policies, cultures and promoting a supportive and accessible environment.\"</p><p>That proposal, particularly the need for \"revising social norms\" has twice struck home to me recently. The first time was during a television programme called \"Operatunity\". The name and occupation of each contestant was flashed up on the screen and read out as people came on to sing. For one particular contestant, the line stated \"Mother of three&#8212;registered blind.\" I thought that that was an appalling thing to do on national television&#8212;to state that that woman, who was taking part along with everybody else, was no more than a mother of three and registered blind.</p><p>The other thing that made me think of that proposal was a comment on a BBC messageboard on the web, called \"ouch!\". As part of his answer to the question of whether he minded being called disabled, a chap called Bob Williams-Findlay explained:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I believe society disables me, not my impairment.\"</p><p>That ties in very much with what members have said today.</p><p>The underpinning principle for all of us must be that people with an impairment should not be regarded as objects of charity or as patients&#8212;they should be independent citizens who are fully integrated into society.

However, to a large extent the attitude of charity remains. We must get over that.</p><p>I could talk for ever about the matter, but the Presiding Officer will be glad to know that I will not.</p><p>I will now address the SNP's amendment. It is lodged as a marker, forcing us all to consider what must be done. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is coming into force. We must push to ensure that we comply with it and must put measures in place to ensure that we comply.

Sanctions have been in place for more than 12 years, but it is apparent that they have failed to achieve what they set out to do, which was to secure peace in the region. The sanctions have had an effect; for example, they have ensured that Iraq's health care system has broken down. They have ensured that Iraq has had no chlorine for its water supplies for many years. They have ensured that Iraq now has one of the highest infant mortality rates on the planet&#8212;the rate has doubled over the past 10 years&#8212;and that one quarter of all Iraqi children are underweight while one fifth are malnourished.</p><p>That is the state of the country with which we might end up at war. It is a country in which, UNICEF estimates, 250 people die every day. In 1996, it was reported that 4,500 children under the age of five die each month from hunger and disease in Iraq. The people also have to face the effect of depleted uranium. That is the state of the country that we are in danger of combating with neither published and compelling clear evidence, nor a specific UN mandate.</p><p>Some people in Iraq would say that we are already at war. Those who live within the no-fly zones have seen their friends and families killed by western bombs. The USA and the UK say that UN resolution 688 allows them to enforce the no-fly zones, but it does not, which was confirmed in 1992 by the then UN Secretary-General. Similarly, the resolution that is currently on the table&#8212;resolution 1441&#8212;provides no automatic right to take military action.</p><p>Reuters news agency reports that seven bombing raids have been carried out against Iraq already this month. Although we are told that no final decision has been taken about the war, American and British bombing of Iraq has increased by some 300 per cent, according to commentators. The <em>Washington Post</em> reports that, back in August, Secretary Rumsfeld ordered that <place-holder colnum=\"17064\"/> the target list be widened. According to answers to parliamentary questions at Westminster, the Royal Air Force dropped more than 124 tonnes of bombs between March and November. What do we call that type of operation?

Firefighters do not carry a pension fund. Serving firefighters pay 11 per cent of their salary back into brigades' general funds, and pensions for retired firefighters are paid from those funds.

The minister mentioned the &#163;127 million that has been set aside to deal with homelessness, but when the Social Justice Committee asked what additional money would be made available over the next few years, it learned that only an extra &#163;14 million had been allocated, rather than the &#163;100-odd million that has been mentioned today.</p><p>I am worried about other aspects of the way in which the bill has been portrayed today. My comments are not meant as a personal criticism, but we must be careful about the language that we use when we talk about homelessness and I was worried by a comment that the minister made about intentionality. She said that people needed to be given a second chance to prove themselves. As Karen Whitefield has often said in the Social Justice Committee, not everyone who is homeless is helpless. Not everyone who is homeless needs to prove anything. Someone may have hit a hard time once in their life; they may need a wee step up, rather than on-going support of the type to which the bill refers.</p><p>The issue of anti-social behaviour has been raised. I am bothered by the language that people use when talking about that. Every time that anti-social behaviour was raised, members spoke about anti-social tenants.

The minister's speech was incredibly short; she did not even speak quickly.</p><p>The SNP welcomes the bill's general policy objectives, many of which are long overdue, such as the objectives of providing greater reassurance for people who use tradespeople and of providing more information to house buyers. The consensus is that local authority powers to identify dangerous buildings should be strengthened, that designers thrive on flexibility and innovation and that the system should be more responsive to the needs of the public and industry. The SNP is always up for providing excellence in public services, encouraging sustainable development and being constructive in helping the Executive to meet its obligations under European directives.</p><p>The main purpose of the bill is to modernise Scotland's building control system. That modernisation must have a robust base, with credible enforcement powers to reflect a basic need for accountability and competence. I am concerned that the policy objectives to which I referred, as outlined in the policy memorandum, have not been reflected in the bill's long title, which is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to make further provision with respect to buildings, building standards, work in relation to buildings and related matters; and for connected purposes.\"</p><p>Many others share those concerns and I ask the minister to consider them further as the bill progresses, so that it can be strengthened to ensure that it is objective driven rather than process driven.</p><p>I do not have time to dissect every element of the bill, but I will raise some particular points. As I said, the provisions on dangerous buildings are welcome, but we should note the evidence of the Fire Protection Association, whose representative said that the bill would not give fire authorities a statutory right to be consulted. Their expertise would be brought into play only if there were variations from technical standards. That is a potential amendment for the Executive to consider.</p><p>I am reminded of the licensing scheme for <place-holder colnum=\"16055\"/> houses in multiple occupation, on which the Social Justice Committee has taken much evidence. I suspect that that scheme was introduced under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 almost as a panic measure after the tragic death of young men in a fire in accommodation in Glasgow that had bars on the window. However, the scheme does not give local authorities further powers to prevent such an incident from happening again. That situation needs to be addressed. I ask the minister to consider lodging an appropriate amendment at stage 2.</p><p>One of my colleagues will concentrate on the functional standards versus technical standards aspect of the bill. I want to register my concern that, if technical standards are no longer to be mandatory, we could be in danger of reducing our standards to a lower common denominator. In light of the European directive, the Executive might feel that it has devised the best way to proceed, but how will the Parliament scrutinise and influence if the enabling legislation allows ministers a free hand with guidance and regulation? The accountability to ministers of the new, or reformed, central building standards body is noted in the policy memorandum but, again, that issue is not addressed in the bill.</p><p>A number of the provisions might have significant cost implications; evidence was taken about the potential costs to local authorities. The City of Edinburgh Council highlighted the potential for an \"enormous burden\" and the Scottish Association of Chief Building Control Officers warned that the aims could not be achieved without \"adequate funding\". Paragraph 148 of the financial memorandum would seem to suggest that fee income and savings gained will result in cost neutrality. I am not convinced, and I ask the Deputy Minister for Social Justice to expand on that when he sums up the debate.</p><p>A particularly contentious issue is that of independent verifiers. It is understandable that strong views were expressed for and against by the private and public sectors. I was a bit puzzled by the evidence that was given by the former Deputy Minister for Social Justice, Hugh Henry. He contended that the Executive had no plans to extend the verification role to the private sector but that the possibility of doing so should not be excluded. I thank the minister for expanding on that point today, but did the former Deputy Minister for Social Justice's evidence indicate that the Executive does not yet know what the additional costs to local authorities are likely to be and that, rather than fund local authorities to do the work, the work will be privatised?</p><p>I was particularly impressed by the Disability Rights Commission's evidence on behalf of the country's 800,000 disabled people. The <place-holder colnum=\"16056\"/> commission also raised the question of replacing mandatory standards with guidance as a cause for concern. Requests for relaxations have long been contentious for disabled people.</p><p>The duties in part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 come into force in October 2004. Bearing that in mind, no building currently in use by the public should be granted relaxations for any aspect of any regulation that would have a direct or indirect negative impact the accessibility or usability of the building by disabled people. I say to the minister that I assume that no relaxations whatever will be allowed in the case of new buildings.</p><p>The explicit inclusion of access and usability in the functional standards would ensure clarity in determinations after a breach is reported. It is also vital that accredited verifiers include professionals who are competent and qualified to certify that a design is accessible and usable by disabled people.</p><p>The Disability Rights Commission asked that the definition on convenience be expanded to include explicit reference to accessibility and usability for the disabled, rather than the implicit references in the policy memorandum and the explanatory notes. The word convenience does not adequately cover, or might not be understood to cover, the requirements of disabled people. A building that is not accessible or usable is considerably more than an inconvenience; it is discriminatory, exclusive and may hinder someone from accessing services and facilities. I am sure that a solution to that issue is not beyond the scope of the many resources that the Executive has to hand. I ask the minister to consider the matter further.</p><p>I also ask for an assurance that the bill is only one part of the continuing modernisation of building construction and repair. Are issues such as tenement law and rethinking construction practices to incorporate the Eagan principles still on the agenda? Who is driving the agenda?</p><p>I could say much more. Fine intentions have been laid before the chamber today and stage 2 will be interesting.

There is surely nothing in it that she would disagree with. It is about the equalisation of funding across the country to ensure that no one is left without protection, and I make a plea for groups who deal with domestic violence but are not affiliated to Scottish Women's Aid. We should make sure that they come into the equation as well, so will the minister comment on that?</p><p>We must recognise and meet the needs of children affected by domestic violence. Irene McGugan mentioned that, as the minister will remember, and it is such an important issue because SWA reminds us that one third of all protection cases have domestic abuse as a factor. I ask the minister also to give us an assurance that the announced increase in funding for child protection will go towards addressing the lack of support workers, rather than merely propping up the current statutory provision. The national strategy clearly states that it is the Executive's responsibility to ensure adequate resourcing for the prevention strategy.

Kenneth Gibson began his speech by giving some facts about poverty, which are worth repeating. Around a quarter of individuals in Scotland live in low-income households, which is higher than the average for Great Britain. In November 2001, the <place-holder colnum=\"15386\"/> total number of people in Scotland on income support was 668,000 which, as a percentage, is above the Great British average. The proportion of the Scottish population aged 16 or over claiming income support is above the Great British average. Around a third of Scottish households claim income-related benefits, in contrast to just over a quarter of Great British households. In 1999-2000, Scottish lone-parent households had the lowest income, at &#163;204 a week, which is again below the Great British average.</p><p>The Labour party tells us that being part of the union is best for Scotland. I want to know how it works that out, because I cannot do so. The minister talked about the myth of independence, but it ain't no myth. Belgium, Norway, Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Finland are not myths and they have less child poverty than Scotland has. The minister did not answer Lloyd Quinan's question on that issue. Lloyd was right to say that those independent countries&#8212;which are not myths or dream fantasies&#8212;have less child poverty than Scotland has.</p><p>The real myth is that the unionist Labour party is committed to poverty eradication. The Labour party came to power in the UK in 1997. It is claimed that Labour was committed to poverty eradication, but how did sticking to Tory spending plans and cutting single-parent and disability benefit amount to poverty eradication? The Liberal Democrats at UK level now say that there is a move to reduce the lone-parent working tax credit by 19 per cent. If that is true, how will that contribute to eradicating poverty levels?</p><p>Robert Brown outlined various initiatives that the Parliament has agreed to. Some of them have been good and have received cross-party support although, as Sandra White said, some Labour members had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support those initiatives. However, those measures will not make substantial inroads into the eradication of poverty because they are no more than tinkering around the edges; they treat the symptoms, not the disease. The only way in which we can treat the disease of poverty is by taking responsibility for it.</p><p>It is sad that some Conservative members think so little of the people of this country that they believe that, without England to shore us up, we would be a nation of social workers and their clients, which was Bill Aitken's comment. It is disgraceful that Bill Aitken has that view of the Scottish people whom he was elected to support.</p><p>Different kinds of poverty have been mentioned. The Executive used to measure poverty in relative terms, but it suddenly decided to change to an absolute measure. Wendy Alexander described absolute poverty as not having the ability to get</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the basic necessities of life.\"<place-holder colnum=\"15387\"/></p><p>It is pathetic that in the third millennium we measure poverty against the ability to get the absolute necessities of life. I want more than that for the people in this country, as do the other SNP members. We want honesty in the measurements. We should not change from a relative to an absolute mark of poverty. If the absolute mark remains the same, inflation alone will mean that the Executive is beating poverty. The concept of absolute poverty is a ridiculous concept&#8212;to use it is cheating and it is not on.</p><p>We then got havering Hugh Henry, who is terrified of the people of Scotland taking matters into their own hands and going for independence. One thing, however, that fascinates me about Hugh Henry&#8212;indeed, it fascinates me about the rest of the Labour members&#8212;is their assumption that, when this country gets independence, which it will, it is the SNP that will be in power. It never crosses the minds of the Labour members that Labour would be in power in an independent Scotland. All that we get is a repeat of the question, \"What would you do when Scotland is independent?\" It seems that the Labour members have accepted that there will be no place for them in an independent Scotland.</p><p>I will tell the chamber what the SNP will do when Scotland becomes independent. We will take on board that the people of Scotland are capable and willing to take their own decisions. The Scottish National Party is the only party in Scotland that has faith in people taking their own decisions. It is the SNP that will be in power, working towards a fairer solution for Scotland.</p><p>I have noticed that the coalition partners have been using a bit of a slogan today&#8212;\"Much done, much more to do,\" which seems to be an admission of failure.

It is surprising that the Scottish ministers do not want to bring the management of Scotland's forests more transparently within the control of Scotland's people. I cannot see how the minister can justify leaving such a valuable Scottish asset in limbo. The position can easily be altered. Westminster legislation is not required. We already own Scotland's forests, so let us bring their operation back home. I ask members to support the SNP position and set up a forestry management structure in Scotland for Scotland.

For example, is the presence of vast conifer monocultures really the way forward for Scottish forestry? Should we not have more regard to the need for biodiversity? Should we think of our forests only as a cash crop?

The sad part is that the Executive does not have the powers that it needs to alter substantially the employment market in Scotland. Worse, it does not even want to acquire those powers. It is interesting that page 21 of \"Closing the Opportunity Gap\", which details the social justice objectives, gives no targets for increasing employment in Scotland.</p><p>There is an unemployment target in the chapter on enterprise and lifelong learning, but it is merely to narrow the division between the worst 10 per cent of areas and the Scottish average. There is no target to increase the number of people in employment.

Therefore, we will never know whether the Executive has managed to <place-holder colnum=\"14655\"/> close the gap, because the figures to measure progress are simply not available.</p><p>Never mind that, the target on page 30 of the document is one of the least ambitious time scales ever for creating employment. There is a concentration on project grants rather than on economic growth. Economic growth is the key to raising employment and to raising the standards of everyone in the country.

That is like painting a house while it is falling down.</p><p>I have no doubt that the Government would like today's debate to be merely a congratulatory pat on the back for having worked out how to spend Gordon Brown's extra pennies, but life is a bit tougher than that. No one in the chamber would argue that extra money should not come to Scotland, but surely we should have the courage to raise and spend our own money rather than rely on someone else. That would mean real responsibility. We would need to take care of ourselves. We would need to raise and spend our own money responsibly and wisely. There is no gain for Scotland in merely throwing money into a pot and hoping that the right result will come out. We need to be sure that the money is spent for the benefit of those whose home is in Scotland.</p><p>Sadly, the Executive is not living up to that duty.

I agree totally; that vote was the most important event in the Parliament to date and I often say so when asked. The vote led to the setting up of the working group on a replacement for poinding and warrant sales. The result of its work is the <place-holder colnum=\"13941\"/> introduction today of the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill. As a member of the Social Justice Committee, I have to say that I had unavoidably to miss some of the meetings at which the bill was debated and evidence taken. However, I have studied carefully the evidence, the committee's report and the <em>Official Report</em>. The issue is one about which I care deeply; over the years I have witnessed the actuality and the effects of debt, including the effect of poindings and warrant sales.</p><p>Most of the contributors to the debate noted that the bill has two main parts. Although members said that the debt arrangement scheme is worthy and long overdue, many expressed concerns. Those are summarised best by Citizens Advice Scotland, which highlighted the sort of scenarios that citizens advice bureaux workers and volunteers encounter regularly. The scenarios include debtors who can repay but whose repayments are less than the interest accruing, debtors who can pay but whose repayments are only marginally more than the interest accruing, debtors whose creditors will not agree to composition of debts and&#8212;far too common&#8212;debtors in high levels of multiple debt.</p><p>Citizens Advice Scotland also highlighted the horrendous situation of debtors in multiple debt whose debt repayment would take longer than the lifespan of the debt arrangement scheme. My colleague Kenneth Gibson alluded to that. I am very pleased that the Social Justice Committee took on board and reported much of the advice that it was given by those at the coalface. The committee has considered how to make the debt arrangement scheme a better scheme.</p><p>I am heartened by the minister's commitment to taking a broad-based approach to that subject and by her recognition that further consultation is required. I foresee copious amendments at stage 2 to allow the part of the bill that deals with the debt arrangement scheme to serve better the needs of those at whom it is aimed. One contentious aspect of the debt arrangement scheme is the need for money and debt advice to be independent. That was outlined eloquently by Robert Brown, who declared his interest in the Rutherglen and Cambuslang citizens advice bureau. We are talking about an area in which perception can be as important as reality. Earlier this week, I spoke to representatives of the East Kilbride citizens advice bureau, who told me that their clients tell them repeatedly that the CAB's independent stance is crucial to those who seek advice.</p><p>It is not surprising that the contentious part of the bill has been the main issue of debate today. I listened carefully to the debate. What I heard reinforces what was at first a gut feeling that the <place-holder colnum=\"13942\"/> bill does not replace warrant sales&#8212;poindings, yes but not warrant sales. However, the will of the Parliament was to abolish both poindings and warrant sales and I am greatly concerned that the will of the Parliament is not being followed.</p>", "hdate": "2002-09-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13279224", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Introduction: Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In his speech, John McAllion stated that the finest moment of the Scottish Parliament so far was the vote to abolish poindings and warrant sales.

I am sure that that will be a huge relief to her.</p><p>Energy efficiency in housing is crucial. The improvement in building regulations is a start; it is a statement of intent. I hope that we can achieve building standards and thermal efficiency in housing of a level as high as that in Scandinavia, where people do not suffer from fuel poverty and where the weather, in parts, is even colder than <place-holder colnum=\"13430\"/> ours. However, we have had that debate before.</p><p>As Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Housing and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations never tire of reminding us, without decent housing the expenditure on services for that housing&#8212;services such as central heating&#8212;will simply fly straight out of the single-glazed steel-framed window, or straight through the roof that has not been properly thermally insulated.</p><p>Expenditure and innovation are required, and there are many good examples. Fyne Homes Ltd in Lochgilphead has a scheme that uses a communal heating system for a housing estate. It is fired by woodchips. That is innovation and an example of the way forward.</p><p>Phil Gallie mentioned the problem of heating in rural areas where we cannot have natural gas. In Cairndow, people managed at the time&#8212;though I still do not know quite how&#8212;to get funding from Scottish Homes not only to put in wood-burning fires with back boilers, but to put in storage tanks and gas central heating as well. That gave people options in how to spend their money and heat their homes. It can be done.</p><p>The cheapest housing solution is not always the best. We have to acknowledge that we have great expertise among our social housing providers and their agents&#8212;the architects. Those people are capable of providing innovative solutions to help with fuel poverty. We have to fund people to make those real improvements. We have to judge applications for social rented housing not entirely on the cost per unit. We should judge housing developments on their long-term sustainability.</p><p>Let us set milestones for a decent home standard. That has been done in England. I know that there have been problems, but the intention is to have decent homes by a specific time. With such a standard, we could tie in the central heating programme, the warm deal and all the rest. We could start by improving the minimum tolerable standard, which has been in place for more than 30 years, which is ludicrous. We should be considering raising that standard.</p><p>The SNP wants this statement to work. I worry that it will not, because of some of the evidence that I heard at the Social Justice Committee about the lack of skills available to carry on the central heating programme. We must constantly monitor the programme's effect, carrying out investigations as to who it is reaching and pick up all those who are being missed.</p><p>We heard evidence at the Social Justice Committee that we should be frontloading the investment. It is only by frontloading the investment that we will ensure that we are not leaving to the end those who are most in need.

Sale of fireworks is a big issue for individuals and groups. It is not just about high spirits, misguided youngsters and incidents that take place around bonfire night. Shona Robison alluded to the fact that fireworks can also be used in a deliberate and sustained campaign of intimidation and for other extremely offensive purposes.</p><p>As Paul Martin said, if fireworks are used properly in appropriate displays, most people can enjoy them. I received a letter from Councillor Diane Williamson of Falkirk Council, who put it better than I could:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"No one wants to be a killjoy or put obstacles in the way <place-holder colnum=\"12612\"/> of local firework displays that are organised and supervised. What we need to target is fireworks getting into the hands of irresponsible individuals who glory in creating mayhem and misery for others, usually those who are unable to fight back.\"</p><p>That is the particularly sad aspect of the problem&#8212;those who are targeted are generally \"unable to fight back.\" We must consider what we in Scotland can do to help to solve the problem. We cannot ban the public sale of fireworks, because that is a reserved matter, although there is a view that we should lobby Westminster for such powers. We cannot wait for Westminster to act. Two private member's bills are going through Westminster but, because of timing, they are unlikely to come to fruition. However, we can take the action that is suggested in Shona Robison's motion; we can review the powers that are available to local authorities in respect of vendor licensing.</p><p>I do not accept the Scottish Retail Consortium's view that the current powers of enforcement are sufficient and merely require better policing. It is absolutely ridiculous that a premises licence costs only &#163;12 per annum. It is also ridiculous that councils cannot refuse to issue a certificate and, as Shona Robison said, are generally powerless to act in cases of overstocking. Overstocking can create a huge problem, although this country has not experienced anything as serious as what has been experienced in other countries. In Peru for example, which I visited last year, special shops are set up for people who make and sell fireworks that are used in a big celebration in Peru. Just after I came back, one of those shops blew up. Hundreds of people in down-town central Lima were killed or injured simply because fireworks are totally unregulated.

Today, however, I am speaking on behalf of the SNP.</p><p>I want to pick up on something that Johann Lamont said, which is crucial to an understanding of the voluntary sector. She spoke about the diversity of the voluntary sector. There are too many perceptions about what the voluntary sector is. People can volunteer for an hour or two every week and do a variety of tasks, but there are also businesses that are run by voluntary committee members, which are also part of the voluntary sector. Being voluntary does not mean being amateur&#8212;it means being professional and <place-holder colnum=\"11708\"/> providing a good service.</p><p>Last night, I visited an after-school care project in Blacklaw. For 10 years, the project has been run entirely voluntarily by local people who act as employers and employ staff. The project has been totally self-funded. It should always be borne in mind that the voluntary sector is a professional part of our social economy.</p><p>Like colleagues, I received the Scottish Executive's response to the committee's report quite late last night. As the First Minister said, personalities go, but the work carries on. It is unfortunate if the unexpected departure of a minister prevented the earlier distribution of the response, which is important. I note that it took a full two months for the Executive, with all its resources, to respond to the committee's report. Ministers should reflect on the fact that voluntary organisations that have more limited resources must respond to many Executive consultations in two months or less. Johann Lamont said that some of the respondents to the inquiry spoke about consultation fatigue and I think that that question has to be considered.</p><p>The Scottish National Party is supportive of the report, the findings of which are broadly in line with what our members have been hearing from volunteers and voluntary organisations for some years. As someone who has spent most of her working life employed in the voluntary sector and working with volunteers, I can see from the report that many of the issues have not changed in the past five, 10 or even 15 years.</p><p>I do not have time to cover the full range of issues highlighted in the report but, of course, there are key issues of concern to which I would like to draw attention. The first is the biggy: funding. The distribution of Scottish Executive funds is a major issue for the voluntary sector. Particular concern was expressed about the lack of core funding and continuing funding for successful projects and also about the fact that there is little recognition of the difficulties that are faced by small organisations when the expected funding does not appear. Despite the supportive words in the Executive's response, all the evidence suggests that the situation will continue to be business as usual. Voluntary organisations have experienced yet another delay in their funding this year. I ask the minister to explain why the decisions on section 9 and section 10 grants did not go out until after the beginning of this financial year and urge him to try to understand the effect that uncertainty of funding has on voluntary organisations. It results in worry for and pressure on the volunteers and the service users.</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13273672", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was going to congratulate Margaret Curran on her ministerial elevation, but she is not here.

It is horrifying that many of those who work in the voluntary sector receive redundancy notices as a matter of routine. We heard about that in evidence that was given to the committee. Given that the Executive has an annual underspend of more than double the total funding that it gives to the voluntary sector, surely we can rectify the situation.</p><p>The evidence of the voluntary sector is that, even when the Executive wants to give away money, it cannot always do so. Would the minister please do what is now commonly known as a McConnell and pledge that this will never happen again? Voluntary groups should be told before the beginning of the year how much money they will receive and should be able to rely on that money arriving on time.</p><p>I found the Executive's response on the mainstreaming of voluntary issues a bit disappointing. I note that the Executive is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"committed to promoting and mainstreaming voluntary sector issues\"</p><p>but what has been achieved? The response talks about working groups, review groups, an issues unit and a management board&#8212;and let us not forget that there is a leaflet that is updated annually. It seems that voluntary issues are no more mainstream now than they were in the Scottish Office. That has to be considered carefully.</p><p>If the minister wants evidence that nothing has changed, he need look only at the Executive's response to recommendation 6. The committee said that voluntary groups should not have to reinvent themselves to secure funding, as the convener of the committee and Keith Raffan said earlier this morning. The Executive responds to that point by immediately reinforcing the issue of innovation. It is that concentration on innovation in Scottish Executive funding that forces groups to reinvent themselves. We have to stop talking about innovation and start talking about best practice. Voluntary groups do some things better than the state does. They should be encouraged with consistent funding and a well-developed national and local infrastructure. The evidence is that voluntary organisations innovate because they are responsive to local and individual problems rather than because the public purse <place-holder colnum=\"11710\"/> dangles a carrot in front of them.</p><p>Local authorities now have three-year rolling budgets, so there should be no difficulty in providing a similar arrangement for the funding that local authorities provide to voluntary organisations. I am glad to see that the Executive says in its response that it has accepted that, and I am sure that we can look forward to local authorities providing that peace of mind.</p><p>As Robert Brown pointed out, voluntary organisations are funded by other sources, such as health boards, too. Recently, with regard to money from the Community Fund, many voluntary organisations have told me about the difficulties that exist in relation to the innovation that is required to secure those funds, too. I have also heard about the difficulty of getting information when grant applications are turned down. The Community Fund appears to say simply that a project has run its course, is no longer innovative and will receive no more funding. In East Kilbride, a wonderful project for adults with severe learning difficulties had to close its doors because it could get no more funding from the Community Fund. The galling part of that is that the Community Fund has not told the group why that happened. The letter that was sent to the group said something like, \"There is no point in your contacting us because we do not have to tell you why we are turning down your further application.\" I ask the minister to examine some of those problems.</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13273672", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I accept the point that Robert Brown is making and I will deal with that element later.

We need to find ways to cut the bureaucracy. We also need to cut out a lot of the buzz phrases. We can talk about community planning and partnership working, but we need to focus our efforts on the people who are getting the service and providing the service and take it from there. How can the needs of those groups best be serviced?</p><p>Before leaving the issue of local infrastructure, I want to comment on social inclusion partnerships. Increasingly, those bodies should be a source of joined-up delivery of support to the voluntary sector at a local level. It is important, therefore, that their decision making is transparent and can stand scrutiny. I have asked a series of questions recently on SIPs and it appears that there is still much to do in relation to establishing those bodies. For example, there was no requirement for a register of interest for members of SIP boards <place-holder colnum=\"11711\"/> before April this year. Having the register is a step forward, but there are still no sanctions for use against anyone who conceals an interest. The burden for keeping the registers has fallen on local authorities, who are obliged to ensure that all members declare any relevant interest.</p><p>It is disappointing that the Executive's response to recommendation 8 fails to address the issue of regulation. To be effective, regulation must be transparent, consistent and backed up by sanctions.</p><p>SIPs are perceived in different ways by different people and we have all heard anecdotal evidence about them. However, a perception that patronage exists or that there is a lack of accountability is almost as important as the problems themselves, whether they exist or not, because it puts people off and stops people benefiting from the project. The Social Justice Committee is considering examining SIPs more closely. I would welcome that and I would also welcome the Executive more closely examining the issue of the regulation of SIPs so that everyone can be confident that they are providing what they should be.</p><p>Johann Lamont mentioned the final issue that I want to touch on, which is the importance to the voluntary sector of the review of charity law. In 1999, when this Parliament was in its infancy, Wendy Alexander, who was Minister for Communities at the time, promised a reform of charity law in Scotland, which was welcomed across the chamber. She set up the McFadden commission, which reported a year ago. We now know that the commission rushed out its report unnecessarily and that nothing will happen, it would seem, until after the next election. Jean McFadden was clearly disappointed at the lack of action and was reported in <i>Third Force News</i> as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If we had known that nothing was going to happen the commission could have had an extra few months putting more details on to some of the recommendations.\"</p><p>She went on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I spoke to ... Jim Wallace and told him of my concerns ... He said there were certain aspects of the recommendations which were 'controversial' and needed more discussion.\"</p><p>If the McFadden commission had not been forced to rush out its report, perhaps that controversy would not exist.</p><p>I am reliably informed that work on the promised review of the social economy has not moved forward since Jackie Baillie's time in the social justice ejector seat, which seems a long time ago. It is a bit worrying that the minister who now has responsibility for the Executive's economic strategy showed so little interest in economic development in his previous role.<place-holder colnum=\"11712\"/></p><p>Members have been waiting for me to use the I-word: independence. My party and I believe that it will take independence for Scotland to have real control over its economy, social or otherwise. The key instruments for economic development in Scotland rest in London. However, it is clear that the voluntary sector has a key role to play in local economic development. I ask the minister to give us a commitment to put the review of the social economy back on track&#8212;or is the review another of Wendy Alexander's ideas that seems to have fallen by the wayside?</p><p>In conclusion&#8212;I am really coming to a conclusion this time&#8212;while we debate reports and responses, we must remember the importance of the voluntary sector to all Scotland's communities, both urban and rural. Each has particular problems, as Mike Rumbles pointed out, such as isolation. It is all very well to talk about population numbers and the level of poverty in one place in comparison with another, but for the individual who lives in poverty, it does not matter how many more people live in poverty around them. We must carefully consider how we deal with the voluntary sector in rural areas, which have their own problems with infrastructure. For example, transport is a basic need, with which the geographic SIPs can help.</p><p>Overall, the voluntary sector provides services that are locally controlled and that focus more clearly on the needs of individual service users and volunteers. The sector is more responsive than remote, bureaucratic organisations and is an important source of community leadership.</p><p>I thank all the volunteers and workers from the voluntary sector who took time to correspond with and meet the Social Justice Committee. They contributed greatly to the development of the committee's thinking. I ask the new ministerial team to consider more fully how to respond to the Social Justice Committee's report and to commit the Executive to taking action more rapidly than it has done to date. The SNP supports the committee's motion, which says that we should note the report, but I ask the minister to take notice of the report.</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13273672", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr Raffan is right.

To do that, we must first ensure that Scotland's houses are fit for Scotland's people to live in. That means that there must be dry, warm houses; therefore, we have to end fuel poverty. After three years of government in a devolved Parliament and the passage of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, in which many of us tried to push for a definition of fuel poverty, the Scottish fuel poverty statement is still out to consultation.</p><p>Despite promises two years ago from the then Minister for Transport and the Environment&#8212;promises which I believe were absolutely sincere&#8212;we are still consulting on the building regulations that relate to conservation of fuel and power.

We await with interest the further roll-out of the scheme to other sections of society and properties that have partial, obsolete or inefficient systems.</p><p>We also need to recognise that central heating alone does not solve fuel poverty. To achieve the sustainability that we all talk about, we need innovative approaches and close working between the housing improvement task force and the fuel poverty action group. Moreover, we must recognise that, if we are to achieve the 15-year target, the interim targets will have to be front-loaded.</p><p>Energy efficiency targets should also be introduced not only to measure progress on the main responsibility of fuel poverty but to deliver on wider issues that are relevant to the Kyoto protocol and the energy review. In order to achieve such targets, we must identify continuing resources for improvements in energy efficiency.</p><p>We must have joined-up policies across portfolios and incorporate fuel poverty into the wider poverty agenda and into all relevant areas such as health, building regulations, the environment and education.

Most of my own work on that subject has centred on south and central American countries, where people on the fruit plantations work in horrendous conditions. In Guatemala and Puerto Rico, even as we speak, workers are being persecuted for seeking better working conditions or for trying to prevent the use of certain insecticides that cause birth deformities and lower life expectancy.</p><p>Trade unions exist in those countries and they are trying very hard to improve the rights of workers. MSPs have met a few of the folk involved in that work. I particularly remember Gilberth Bermudez, who has visited the country a few times to talk to parliamentarians and trade unions. At the moment, Gilberth is in hiding in Latin America. His life is in danger because he is trying to organise workers and to secure a better deal for them.<place-holder colnum=\"11380\"/></p><p>Moreover, about a year and a half ago, another trade union activist called Doris Calvo spoke to the SNP conference.

I am talking about companies such as Del Monte and Dole. We see Del Monte's produce on the shelves everywhere we go and those terribly jolly adverts in which the man from Del Monte says yes. In actual fact, the man from Del Monte says no. He says no to trade union and workers' rights and safety legislation in the fruit plantations that the company deals with.</p><p>I pay tribute to the volunteers and workers of the World Development Movement, which constantly tries to raise such issues on behalf of international workers. I also pay tribute to our own trade unions, which lobby very hard on the behalf of those workers and form strong partnerships with other trade unions across the world, particularly those in Latin America.</p><p>I again thank Cathy Peattie and apologise for having to leave as soon as I finish.

Those commitments were made when the UK Government ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in December 1991, which means that the Government should obey the law as written in that convention. Article 1 of the convention says that everyone under 18 years has the rights under the convention. Sadly, I think that the UK Government falls down on article 4, which says that Governments should make the rights available to children.</p><p>The UK Government also falls down on its refusal to ratify article 22, which states that children who come into a country as refugees <place-holder colnum=\"11234\"/> should have the same rights as children who are born in that country. We can see in Scotland why the UK Government refused to ratify article 22. I refer to the fact that in a Home Office immigration removal centre in the area that I represent, which was recently reclassified without our knowledge, children are held under lock and key and behind barbed wire. That is a direct result of UK Government policy.</p><p>When some of my colleagues visited that centre&#8212;Dungavel&#8212;last week, 16 children were living in the family unit. They do not go to school and are educated in-house. They must pass through locked doors to get outside to play. The Executive allows that to happen and&#8212;as far as I know&#8212;puts no pressure on its UK partners to stop the practice.</p><p>We should insist to the Executive that the so-called risk of absconding does not outweigh the damage to children who are denied their freedom, and that in Scotland we should explore community reporting procedures as an alternative to locking up children. We should ensure that the Home Office does not force Scottish local authorities into a breach of their duties under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. I am sure that Scottish local authorities and sheriffs would be most concerned about cases of children being wakened early in the morning, being removed from their place of residence and losing their access to school education and to friends that they have made. There is nothing in the Immigration Act 1971, as amended, to overrule the provisions of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p><p>Before the minister says that the matter is reserved, I will say that that is not good enough. Westminster MPs have tried to cloud the issue by accusing members of the cross-party parliamentary group on refugees and asylum seekers of criticising the workers at the Dungavel centre. That is not the case. The group criticised the Government's policy of locking up people who have not committed a crime and who have children. One Westminster MP, Mr Harris, said on \"Newsnight\" that the cross-party group on refugees and asylum seekers is no different from Westminster's all-party group on \"Coronation Street\". I do not believe that members of the all-party group on \"Coronation Street\" have ever visited children behind barbed wire.

It is clear that neither of them had read the report, or if they had read it, they must have done so a long time ago. Perhaps they have a short attention span and have forgotten what it said. They did not even seem to know the report's title.</p><p>Bill Aitken used the opportunity to rant on about his personal prejudices and gave no thought to the content of the report. I started off with a certain sympathy for what he said about the report not containing anything that we did not already know. He is right that most of us knew what the story is but, as Frank McAveety said, the problems need to be quantified before they can be addressed. I am pleased that the problems have at last been quantified. Over the piece, successive UK Governments of both hues have simply ignored the problems in the private sector, especially the problems in the private rented sector. Far be it from me to praise my colleagues, but I am glad that we at last have a quantified report of the problems that need to be addressed. We should all work together to address those problems for the benefit of everyone.</p><p>I agreed with one thing that Bill Aitken said, which was that the opening up of improvement grants in the early 1980s&#8212;and the 1970s&#8212;made a huge difference to the private sector in many cities and towns. I have a problem with the Tories' motivation in doing that but, nevertheless, the result was that many houses were improved. We should look again at the methods that were used to bring that about. The designation of housing action areas allowed a lot of grant funding to be provided for improvements to houses in such areas and wonderful improvements were made. Kenny Gibson mentioned the need for more grants. Even at my tender age, I can remember a regime under which 90 per cent grants were available for houses that were below tolerable standard in housing action areas. If we are serious about doing up our houses and making all the houses in our country fit to live in, we should look at that kind of thing again.</p><p>Many of the problems apply mainly to tenemental properties. As the minister said, we have a problem because people do not understand, or will not comply with, the shared obligations that arise in relation to properties where there are, so to speak, multiple properties under the one roof. Therefore, it is a great shame <place-holder colnum=\"10892\"/> that tenement law reform has been bumped down the agenda since the Parliament came into being. On many occasions, I have asked when the Parliament will consider the issue, which was, after all, a manifesto commitment back in 1999. The answer that I have received is that we need to wait until the title conditions bill has been dealt with. We should push on with tenement law reform because it is absolutely crucial.</p><p>I reiterate that the problem concerns not only tenements and cities; rural housing is also full of problems. Many of our rural properties are in an absolutely horrendous condition. Not that long ago, I worked in housing and we were still dealing with properties that had outside toilets. In this century and millennium, that is an absolute piece of nonsense. I imagine that there are still properties in rural areas which are in that condition.</p><p>Although I said that we now have a quantified report, I have a problem with one thing that it contains, which is the statement that there is not necessarily a link between low incomes and poor housing conditions. Many of us know that there is in fact a link and many studies have shown that the link exists. I would like that aspect of the report to be revisited. Whenever housing associations, which have experience over the piece, have looked at which properties they should do up, the poorest-quality properties have always been inhabited by people on low incomes.</p><p>Nora Radcliffe mentioned housing logbooks, which are another innovative idea that we should consider along with sellers surveys. In fact, under construction regulations that have been introduced within the past decade, developers who rehabilitate properties are already required to keep a formal logbook. Perhaps we could build on that and consider introducing the measure for people who buy properties further down the line.</p><p>I want to cut to the chase now, because I feel that nobody has done so thus far. We can talk all we like about the report and say all these things and know what way we need to go but, unless we are willing to make the resources available, we will not improve the private housing stock in this country. I think it was the Chartered Institute of Housing that said in its briefing&#8212;and I agree&#8212;that while it welcomed the &#163;10 million for new policy initiatives, the money would not eradicate the severe problems of disrepair.</p><p>Housing is much more than just a matter of bricks and mortar; it affects many things in our society. We know that we could save money in the health service if everybody was in decent housing. That point was confirmed again by Professor Arbuthnott on news programmes this morning.</p><p>I do not want to be too pessimistic about this <place-holder colnum=\"10893\"/> issue, because I hope very much that one of Kenny Gibson's dreams will come true in the budget today&#8212;I hope that we will leave here to find that Gordon Brown has made the sensible move of saying that housing improvement, repair and rehabilitation will not be subject to VAT. That would free up a wonderful amount of resources&#8212;so, fingers crossed.</p><p>In England and Wales, there is a target to eradicate poor housing by a certain date&#8212;I cannot remember the year. We have such a target for fuel poverty, but I think that we should be imaginative and set a target for housing.</p><p>We must put our money where our mouth is. Before somebody asks me, I will talk about how to pay. I was quite disappointed in what the Minister for Social Justice said this morning about the fact that, if large-scale stock transfers take place, we will have more money in the Scottish block grant because the Treasury will write off residual housing debt. Why can we not ensure that any money that is freed up in our grant is put directly into housing? The minister said that it would not be and that it would be for the Cabinet to decide how the money is spent. I ask the minister to try to convince his colleagues to consider spending on housing any money that is freed up by stock transfers. It does not seem right that we are selling council house stock and then using the money to prop up budgets elsewhere.</p><p>We wanted all these issues to be discussed as part of a comprehensive housing bill. That did not happen, but we cannot lose the momentum now. I urge members to support the SNP amendment S1M-2982.1, which sets a timetable for the start of action by this Parliament, to ensure that the problems are addressed.</p>", "hdate": "2002-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13271350", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Improvement Task Force"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Bill Aitken and Keith Harding were wasting the Parliament's time.

I feel strongly that one of the major factors in the problems that arose previously was the lack of willingness on the part of ministers to shoulder responsibility when the extent of the corporate denial, to which Ian Jenkins referred, eventually came to light. I hope that the sudden realisation of the duties of Government will be infectious, and that we will see a bit more of it from time to time in the chamber. Who knows, perhaps we may even hear an admission from the Government that independence is the best way for Scotland to go.</p><p>I welcome the bill. I hope that in changing the structure of the SQA we can also change the culture of that organisation, to ensure that its focus is entirely on the students who are waiting for their <place-holder colnum=\"10329\"/> results. I wish to mention a group of people who were not mentioned much at the time of the trouble in the SQA. It was not just higher and standard grade students who had problems; in my constituency, many youngsters at further education colleges, who were waiting for the validation of their higher national certificates and higher national diplomas, were also traumatised by the trouble that the SQA was going through. We should remember that the SQA deals with more than just schools.

One of those issues, which was mentioned by Alex Neil, concerns the advisory council. It looks like the advisory council will be governed largely by secondary legislation, and that concerns me. I tend to go on about secondary legislation all the time, because we end up dealing with a lot of secondary legislation from the legislation that is passed by this Parliament. I have heard it said by ministers and their advisers that that is normal. Well, what is normal? We have been here for three years, and we should determine what is normal.

I have learned with horror about the prevalence of chronic pain and about its many causes. From speaking to other people, I have learned that the cost of chronic pain to the national health service cannot be measured only in hard cash terms, because physical and sometimes emotional and mental illnesses can result from suffering chronic pain.</p><p>The social cost was mentioned by Elaine Smith and many others. I wonder whether we should take a much wider view of chronic pain, its causes&#8212;of course&#8212;and its effects. We should consider other ways of dealing with and managing it. For example, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy is keen for workplace physiotherapy to be put in place. That could help people to manage their pain and remain in the employment market, which is what they want to do. It must be awful to have the will to carry on with life normally, as everyone else does, but to suffer chronic pain and be unable to do that.</p><p>I am keen that we take a step back and take a holistic approach. We should think about a bit of innovation. We should look at alternative therapy, complementary medicine and preventive strategies. Throughout the health service, we do not take enough account of the prevention of illness and place too much emphasis on curing illness.</p><p>Pain management programmes and a national framework and guidelines for the management of pain, whether in specialist pain clinics or existing resources, have been discussed. As I said, I am not an expert, but I contend that bodies such as the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the Pain Association Scotland, which Dorothy-Grace Elder mentioned, are experts. They are strong on considering such measures, which could have added benefits for the NHS in general, because no <place-holder colnum=\"9760\"/> one talks about many conditions that cause chronic pain.</p><p>Many people suffer chronic pain from various illnesses that are never talked about and on which records are not held centrally, for example. I have asked the Executive about a condition called scleroderma, which is sometimes called systemic sclerosis. The Executive told me that it did not hold figures centrally on various aspects of the illness and that the illness is very rare. Many such illnesses might be rare, but to the people who suffer the illness and its resultant pain, it does not matter that the illness is rare. What matters is that no resources exist to help them. I feel strongly that a national pain strategy and centres could help to unearth some of the hidden illnesses and suffering in our society.</p><p>I pay tribute to the voluntary sector, which does a wonderful job all over our country in assisting the national health service and helping people to manage their day-to-day lives while they suffer chronic pain.</p>", "hdate": "2002-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13268340", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I thank everyone, headed up by Dorothy-Grace Elder, who has taken part in the debate on this issue in the three years since the Parliament was set up.

When I first considered the issue, what came to mind was the Executive's national cultural strategy document, \"Creating our future ... minding our past\", which was one of the Executive's flagship documents some time ago. It puts great emphasis on participation in Scotland's culture and seeks to increase such participation among children. In fact, the document specifically states that, as well as instrumental tuition within the class, many children</p><p class=\"indent\">\"can choose to receive additional specialist tuition\".</p><p>Furthermore,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Pupils who choose to study music at S3 and beyond\"</p><p>can</p><p class=\"indent\">\"receive specialist tuition in one or more instruments\".</p><p>The strategy document makes a commitment to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Produce guidance on best practice for local authorities on the provision of instrumental tuition services\".</p><p>Has that been done?</p><p>The strategy document also refers to the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"disparity in the provision of instrumental tuition across ... local authorities\"</p><p>and the variation in tuition rates. Indeed, the document appears to recognise that there is a problem in that respect and states that the Executive will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"work with education authorities to maximise opportunities for instrumental tuition in schools, free to those unable to pay\".</p><p>What steps have been taken towards such fine <place-holder colnum=\"6289\"/> objectives?</p><p>I was worried at first about the introduction of tuition fees in some schools; now we have this latest move to break the statutory link with teachers' pay. I feel very much that if that goes ahead, it will reduce the status of the instructor and the musician within the profession. We have to consider whether those people will want to continue working with such a reduced status. The situation seems to be completely at odds with the national cultural strategy's emphasis on the importance of tuition. Steps are now being taken to undermine the position of these folk who are doing such a good job.</p><p>Like other members, I draw attention to the position of education advisers. More than a decade ago, music had its own specialist advisers in each education authority, providing support for teachers and instructors alike. Music now forms part of a group of subjects that are covered by one adviser who is not necessarily a music specialist. Naturally, that must have a negative effect on the provision of in-service guidance for teachers and instructors. Instrumental instructors are not the only ones to face a reduction in status; the advisory service is much reduced, grossly overburdened and faces a similar demoralising situation, which is compounded by the fact that advisers do not come under the McCrone settlement either, and are waiting to see what will happen to their salaries.</p><p>The encouraging aims of the national cultural strategy, which was broadly welcomed when it was introduced a long time ago, cannot be achieved without enthusiastic support from the profession.

I am tempted to say that I more or less agree with everything that everyone has said and sit down. However, I want some points to be clarified.</p><p>We have all said how wonderful it is that the ombudsman service will be a one-stop shop. However, there are certain exceptions. Tricia Marwick mentioned the water boards, Mary Scanlon mentioned social work complaints and, in committee, Iain Smith talked about prison complaints. The ombudsman service will not be a one-stop shop for everybody.</p><p>Before anyone jumps up to intervene, I am saying not that the Executive has got it wrong, but that we must be careful. When we publicise the ombudsman&#8212;as is necessary&#8212;we must not raise false expectations. If we are not careful, people might believe that, no matter what their complaint about any element of the public service, it will be solved by going to the one-stop shop. We need to exercise caution about how we frame the advertising and the publicity.</p><p>I am pleased by the independence of the office, as that is crucial. I know that the ombudsman is to be appointed by the Parliament, but I would like the minister to state how he envisages that appointment taking place. Will there be a vote in the chamber? Will the parties co-operate through a body such as the Parliamentary Bureau? There should be no perception that there has been any political interference in the appointment of the ombudsman.</p><p>The definition of maladministration was mentioned. I know that the bill will not contain such a definition. The matter relates to discretion and informal resolution, which has been mentioned by many people. The only experience that I have of dealing with an ombudsman&#8212;I hasten to add that <place-holder colnum=\"5953\"/> I was not being investigated at the time&#8212;was when I dealt with the housing association ombudsman. One of the great strengths of that office was the informal resolution mechanism. It would be a great loss if the new ombudsman did not have a similar element of discretion. If a member of the public thinks that as soon as they pick up a phone to make a complaint a formal investigation will start up, they might be deterred by that formality. Sometimes, informal resolution can work much better. I noticed that the minister said that, following the recommendation of the Local Government Committee, he would consider that matter again. I urge him to do so carefully.</p><p>Keith Harding talked about there being no specialised deputies. That point has worried me since it was raised at a Local Government Committee meeting that I attended. I have since read about it in the Local Government Committee report and I am still open-minded about the matter. I sympathise with Janis Hughes and I understand Trish Godman's point about the possibility of ending up with a situation similar to that which exists at the moment&#8212;a fractured service in an umbrella organisation. I ask the Local Government Committee to consider the issue again during stage 2.</p><p>Consistency of powers is important. It is confusing that one element of the ombudsman service should have greater powers than other elements in relation to maladministration. I do not accept that that greater power should be taken away from housing associations because it has been used only once. As Iain Smith said, that is not a valid reason.</p><p>Johann Lamont touched on an important point when she said that the least advantaged people in society are the least likely to get satisfaction from a public agency. Before the Local Government Committee's report was published, I put a query to the Scottish Parliament information centre about that. I was pleased by the clarification in the bill that a third party can be authorised to complain on behalf of someone. That is crucial.</p><p>My query was about whether voluntary organisations could complain to the new ombudsman. The bill shows that voluntary organisations will be able to complain on their own behalf and on behalf of an individual. Voluntary organisations will be able to use that role well, because they tend to have good relationships with people in their communities. Donald Gorrie talked about communities. Voluntary organisations are well placed and people have confidence in them to take up complaints. Their being able to do that on behalf of individuals is an important step forward.</p><p>I reaffirm the SNP's support for the bill. I apologise for my colleague Tricia Marwick's not being present&#8212;she is unwell. I look forward with <place-holder colnum=\"5954\"/> great confidence to the Local Government Committee's detailed investigation of the bill at stage 2.

I speak to him not in his role as a minister but as a member who feels strongly about the issue, as I do. Like Euan Robson, I have received lots of approaches from people in my constituency&#8212;probably as a result of having signed the bill&#8212;who are not religious, who choose to get married and who find it unfair that they are restricted as to where the ceremony can be carried out. That is a mark of how difficult it is for people who have no religion and who are not willing to pretend that they have a religious conviction to meet the standards of the society that we live in, which is firmly built on religious institutions such as marriage.</p><p>Such institutions also include funerals. It was difficult for my family when my father died unexpectedly: his wishes were that he should have a funeral that was in no way religious. We were not prepared for the event, and it was very difficult to carry out his wishes. Furthermore, some of the things that were said to us as a family when we were trying to arrange the funeral were hurtful. <place-holder colnum=\"5564\"/></p><p>At some point, we must address the issue of people without religion.</p><p>I was pleased when Euan Robson published his draft member's bill and was pleased by its intentions, but when the Executive published the bill after Euan Robson was promoted, I found it cumbersome and not nearly as simple as I thought it should be. It seemed to me that the draft bill gave religious celebrants the option of marrying people anywhere, but the bill as introduced will restrict marriage venues to places that a local authority deems acceptable.</p><p>I agree with Michael McMahon's strongly expressed opinion that a local authority should not be left to work out whether a place is suitable as a marriage venue. I ask the minister to look again at that matter. After all, one person's meat is another person's poison. If ministers of religion are willing to marry people in such places as mountain-tops, they should be allowed to do so. I believe that this is an equality issue. Why should someone who wants a registrar to marry them not have the same option? Perhaps the person who carries out the ceremony should decide whether they are willing to do so in a particular venue or location.</p><p>I was a bit concerned about the views of the Local Government Committee and some councils that it should be easy to amend the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. One council&#8212;perhaps it was Dumfries and Galloway Council&#8212;said in evidence that that could be done by the insertion of only three words into the 1982 act. I urge caution on that matter, because in a job that I used to have I worked with the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. It is a cumbersome piece of legislation that is not clear. I am pleased that the 1982 act is being reviewed by the Executive, because it should be. Such a review is long overdue.</p><p>There was a recent amendment to the 1982 act in relation to houses in multiple occupation, which is an issue that we in the Social Justice Committee have been investigating. I will not pre-empt that committee's decision on the operation of that amendment, but my view is that it was wrong to make such an amendment, whose effects have been terribly cumbersome. It was a bad piece of legislating to amend the 1982 act to take on board something else, so I urge the Local Government Committee to be cautious about the view that it should be simple to amend the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 to take the issue of marriage venues on board.</p><p>I err on the side of caution by believing that primary legislation is required on the issue of marriage venues, but I also have great worries about the volume of secondary legislation that will be required. I concur with the Local Government Committee's view: if we are to have primary <place-holder colnum=\"5565\"/> legislation, let us have as much as possible in the bill to avoid discrepancies in the future and, indeed, vague legislation. Regulation is fine, but we must have something that can be enforced. I am sure that we can find a compromise between primary legislation and regulation that would allow decisions on the suitability of venues for marriage to be carried out equitably for everyone.</p>", "hdate": "2002-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13264796", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not a member of the Local Government Committee, so I have not had the benefit of listening to all the evidence that has been given to it, although I have, of course, read its report closely.

I do not believe that that comes from incompetence this time. It is because the power and influence that we need to make Scotland a socially just country have been retained by Westminster.</p><p>Scotland's ambitions are being ignored by the Government in Edinburgh. Once again, the little green book provides some perspective in its statement that, when setting targets, we have \"to measure what matters\".

The document says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Delivering social justice will ... need a more effective rethink of how to allocate and use public budgets.\"</p><p>The Executive can think all it likes, but the most important budgets are controlled in London.

If it is truly serious about changing the face of Scottish society and if it really wants to make a difference to the lives of Scots from children through to pensioners, it must have the power to make such a change. As that power currently resides in Westminster, it has to be brought back to Scotland. The Parliament and Government must have the power to change taxation, alter benefits and revise employment law&#8212;and those are just the powers that are needed for social justice.</p><p>In short, Scotland needs to become a proper nation again. If we are to improve the lives of our people and lift children out of the poverty trap&#8212;and I do not mean by 1 per cent over four years, because goodness knows how long it will take us at that rate&#8212;and if we are to give our pensioners a decent standard of living and insist that families have enough to live on, we have to take back the power to legislate on those issues.</p><p>I will make it even more simple. Scotland must become a normal, independent nation state where we are free to make our own choices, to choose how we spend our money, and to decide what laws we make&#8212;indeed, where we have the freedom to be normal.</p><p>I know that the Executive does not have the vision to join us on that journey just now, but I also know that it will try to claim the credit for starting that journey once we arrive at our destination. The Executive has to get off its knees, dispose of the begging-bowl mentality and stop looking to London. It has to start standing up for itself and for Scotland. It was elected by the people of this nation to deliver for them, not to be the puppets of another Parliament.

We <place-holder colnum=\"3473\"/> should not forget that, in the course of our country's history, although long ago, we have also suffered repression and forced emigration to other shores. We, from this country, were indeed asylum seekers. From time to time, it has been the unfortunate position that people who have come to live here have been fleeing repression or mistreatment in other nations. We have been a safe haven to which they have turned in their time of need.</p><p>We in Scotland have been very lucky, in that many of those who have come to our shores have chosen to remain here and have enriched our society and culture. We still have space. Scotland is not full up. We know that our population is falling and that we are heading for a skills shortage, which can in some way be met through continuing our tradition of welcoming new Scots who have the skills that our society requires.</p><p>A short time ago, an English Tory MP said that Britain was in danger of becoming a mongrel nation. There was uproar and calls for that MP's resignation; there was outrage that he should be saying such things. I also remember William McIlvanney telling a rally in Glasgow that Scotland was a mongrel nation. He was cheered for that, because the Scots in the audience were&#8212;and are&#8212;happy that we are indeed a mongrel nation, with the benefits to all of us that that brings.</p><p>We should strive to accept our fellow human beings into our midst and to treat all as we would want to be treated. Similar sentiments were expressed in this chamber at the official opening of the Parliament in 1999:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That man to man, the world o'er<br/> Shall brithers be for a' that.\"</p><p>That is a fine aspiration which we should be at the forefront of promoting.</p><p>For that reason, I want today to praise the work that the Executive and this Parliament have done recently. It is true that ministers were initially reluctant to act against the dictates of Westminster, but once they were on their way they went willingly enough. The work that has been done recently in Glasgow is a testament to the Scots attitude that I mentioned a few moments ago. One indication of that attitude was the appointment of Jackie Baillie as minister with special responsibility for asylum seekers, which indicated that this country was prepared to do whatever it can to aid and assist those who are forced to flee their countries. I congratulate the minister on her appointment and the First Minister on having the courage to insist that this post was needed in Scotland.</p><p>Because of Jackie Baillie's appointment, we have now begun to take steps to deliver at least a semblance of social justice to asylum seekers in <place-holder colnum=\"3474\"/> Scotland. I welcome the funding for a law centre to help asylum seekers in Glasgow, the funding for language skills and services, the extra money that has been made available to social inclusion partnerships and today's announcement of the Scottish refugee integration forum. We all know that much of the work should have been done before the asylum seekers arrived in Scotland, but it is being done now. My SNP colleagues and I welcome the work that is being done to integrate asylum seekers into the host communities. It is not yet enough, but it has begun and it is a step in the right direction. I urge the minister and the Executive to continue thinking along those lines and to continue seeking ways in which to help asylum seekers and the communities of Scotland. I know that the minister will do that, because I have faith in her belief in social justice. I ask her to carry it forward with renewed vigour.</p><p>As we have heard today, too often this world slips into crisis. Too often we are faced with the sight of large numbers of people being repressed, tortured, bombed out of their workplaces and homes, or subjected to genocide. We must not fail to continue on the particularly Scottish path of social justice and egalitarianism. This country can and must play its part in ameliorating the suffering of asylum seekers and refugees. We can and must stand with the international community in seeking to find homes for asylum seekers. We can and must have an internationalist outlook, rather than the narrow, inward-looking politics of the fortress.</p><p>That is why our amendment to the minister's motion regrets the moves made on Monday by her London colleagues. The statement that David Blunkett made on Monday at Westminster suggested a shift into the shadows of insularity and isolationism&#8212;a step into the narrows. He made it clear that he wanted to send a signal to people throughout the world</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that the United Kingdom is not a soft touch.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2001-10-29.627.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>House of Commons</em>, 29 October 2001; Vol 373, c 627.]</citation></p><p>That was language straight from the mouth of Ann Widdecombe. Not only was it the language of the dark, but the new policy of the new Labour Government echoes some of the worst fears of those of us who believe in social justice and humanity. No longer are we to be allowed to welcome asylum seekers into our communities. Instead, they will be locked up in camps.

There is a perception that, in wishing to be seen to fulfil their obligations in relation to consultation, the statutory agencies, health boards, health trusts and councils are starting to set up their own groups and are not acknowledging the views of the groups that have for many years been working at the front line.</p><p>I use the word \"perception\" because I do not know the reality of the situation. I raised the matter at the Social Justice Committee and was told by Executive representatives that the Scottish Executive is not monitoring whether the money that is given to local authorities is spent on the purposes for which it is given, when that money is not ring-fenced. I ask the minister and the Scottish Executive to address that.</p><p>Members mentioned voluntary organisations in relation to poverty in our country. We know about urban deprivation and rural deprivation, but I was stunned to hear George Lyon say that there is no citizens advice bureau in Argyll and Bute.</p>", "hdate": "2001-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13257766", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I meant that Mr Stone was a girl guide ambassador, not a girl guide.

Preparation and knowledge of what is happening is the key.</p><p>I also welcome the appointment of Jackie Baillie&#8212;and presumably of Margaret Curran as her deputy&#8212;to spearhead the approach to refugees and asylum seekers in Scotland. It is important that we have someone heading up that work.</p><p>However, I sound a slight note of less than optimism. There is so much that can be done in Scotland and so much that can be done to help Sighthill. Much can be done to help people once they come here, but I feel that the systems that we have in the UK, over which Scotland has no control, are creating problems too. I hope that part of the ministers' remit will be to ensure that there is proper co-operation between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government on the strategic issues surrounding asylum seekers and refugees to make practices a bit better.</p><p>Robert Brown mentioned problems with NASS. Many MSPs, as well as local volunteers who work directly with refugees and asylum seekers, have tried hard to get some sense out of the prevailing systems, but we have found it very difficult. Small things can cause problems. For example, a bus load of asylum seekers may arrive, but the welcoming people may have lists with different names on them. I heard of a couple in Sighthill who had to go to Liverpool for an interview, but were not sent their tickets and had to borrow the money to get there, in terror that they would miss the interview. They have still not had their money refunded; when people are living on vouchers, that is a ridiculous situation.</p><p>I have also heard of people who go down to England for an interview and take their children with them, but who have no money to buy food. In some cases, they may not have eaten for 24 hours by the time they have got down there and back again. That is difficult for anyone to cope with, but when English is not their first language and they are jaunting about a country that is completely alien to them, it is even more difficult. I hope that Jackie Baillie and Margaret Curran will be able to take such examples on board. Even if they cannot insist that NASS opens an office up here so that people can go for local interviews, they should at <place-holder colnum=\"2779\"/> least try to do something to streamline the procedures. I have no doubt that they will try to do that.</p><p>Dungavel detention centre is in the area where I live. I have visited the centre and I have no doubt that the people who work there, 95 per cent of whom are local, want to do the very best they can for the people who are detained there. However, there are restrictions. I have found that, even for a local MSP, it is very difficult to get information about what is happening there. I do not know whether detention will be part of the ministers' remit, but I hope that they will monitor detention closely. We should be monitoring detention in Scotland, asking for information in Scotland and insisting on getting that information in Scotland. It is only then that we can make bland statements such as \"Scotland welcomes asylum seekers,\" or \"Scotland's not racist and welcomes refugees.\" We have to grasp the opportunity to insist that we are a welcoming society.

However, it concerns me greatly that, if we keep going as we are, we are heading towards a situation in which public expenditure could, quite literally, become a lottery.</p><p>I am also concerned about comments that were made earlier this week by the chairperson of the National Lottery Commission to the effect that there is likely to be a shortfall from what Camelot expected when it made its bid. I hope that that does not point to a future shortfall in funding. Will we see a lottery squeeze that is far worse than the Barnett squeeze?</p><p>I mentioned social justice. I am concerned that, although we all welcome the wonderful social justice initiatives that come through lottery funding, Angus MacKay's budget speech this morning showed that the social justice budget for the Parliament over the next two years will lose &#163;35 million. I wonder whether Allan Wilson will address that issue.</p><p>I said that I would come back to sport. Like everybody else, I welcome the injection of money to improve sports in schools.

The corporate body and the progress group are to be commended for that. I do not mind patting myself on the back because it has taken a lot of hard work to get here. I also pat Andrew Welsh and the rest of my colleagues on the back. My colleagues had the strength and the public commitment to say, \"We were handed this. It was done completely wrongly and we accept that, but now we are moving towards a Parliament for the people of Scotland. We must take part in that.\" We will work collectively to ensure that what we get at the end is a Parliament that is fit for the people of Scotland.</p><p>I was not going to be political, but I will reply to Ken Macintosh, who accused the SNP of being irresponsible. What we have been doing has not been irresponsible. What was irresponsible was the mass agreement to the &#163;195 million cap that was put in place last year, which came from a base of no knowledge of how the project was being run and how it would continue.</p><p>The project that we inherited is now different. It is well managed and tightly run. Much has been thrown at us over the Alan Ezzi situation, but I tell members that Alan Ezzi came on board and made a valuable contribution. It was then realised on both sides that the project had moved on a stage, and that different skills were required. It is to the credit of the character of Alan Ezzi and to the tight management of the progress group and the SPCB that mutual agreement was reached on a parting of the ways. That is a mark of how the project is now being run&#8212;with control.</p><p>In relation to the SNP amendment, it is clear that no public service money should be spent on the project. However, that is not within the remit of the project group, so I will hand that issue back. The SNP amendment also seeks to have a minister on board. For the record, I would be delighted to welcome Tom McCabe to the progress group, but I will lay down the ground rules now. If Tom McCabe comes on to the progress group, he will not be in charge and there is no way that he will fix me.

Over the years, there has been much debate on affordability of rents. It is ironic that we talk about affordable rents all the time without having a clear definition of the term. I feel strongly that it is time we clarified that once and for all.</p><p>We all know the financial constraints under which landlords are operating and the obligations and responsibilities that they have relating to stock condition and services to tenants. We know that we are moving towards stock transfers away from councils to many new registered social landlords, some of which, under the bill, will be private housing companies. Those registered social landlords will be dependent on the private sector for development funding, the costs of which will have to be met from rents. Rents are therefore likely to rise. We would be foolish to suppose otherwise.</p><p>Because of the capital funding system for housing that has been with us since 1989, there are already huge differences in rents across the country. The average weekly local authority rent in Midlothian is &#163;25.50, whereas in the City of Edinburgh it is &#163;45.35. The average weekly rent for a Govanhill Housing Association property is &#163;29.07, whereas that of a Melville Housing Association property is &#163;47.66. During the debate on the bill, we have talked a great deal about fuel poverty. There is also such a thing as rent poverty.</p><p>In England and Wales, such a situation arose much earlier than it has in Scotland. Over the past couple of decades, social rents in both nations have risen alarmingly as public sector funding for housing has been reduced, with private sector funding supplying the bulk of resources for new housing development and rehabilitation of existing stock. Reliance on housing benefit has reached crisis proportions in some areas of Greater London.</p><p>In Scotland, two thirds of housing subsidy is housing benefit, over which the Scottish Parliament has no control. That subsidy comes directly from Her Majesty's Treasury and it is clear from the Scotland Act 1998 that the Scottish block grant could be cut if the Treasury took the view that Scotland's councils were claiming too much subsidy.</p><p>All those issues should be investigated. If the Parliament accepts my amendment, it will go some way towards ensuring that that happens. It will also send a clear message that we recognise the issue of affordability in relation to the costs of one of our society's basic commodities: housing and the roof over people's heads.

Often, when we discuss architecture&#8212;and in the Executive document itself&#8212;it all becomes a bit high flown and we get away from the real benefits that architecture can bring. I am not especially criticising that, because it is a fault throughout <place-holder colnum=\"723\"/> society that when issues such as architecture are mentioned, people say, \"Oh, I don't really want to know about that.\" It then becomes a discussion for those and such as those.</p><p>One of the observations of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland was that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The architecture policy consultation did not capture the imagination of the public\".</p><p>That is a fact. Mike Russell talked about the number of members of the public that turned up at meetings. That is noted throughout the consultation. We must address the issue, because architecture captures the imagination of the public, but only certain aspects of architecture. We must examine that and learn from it.</p><p>It has been mentioned that although there have been a lot of disasters in housing, a lot of good work has also been done. I contend that most of the good stuff that has been done in housing is where it has captured the imagination of the public and there has been direct public input into the finished product. Housing associations are in the front line in the promotion of that. I have seen it in action.</p><p>Architecture can capture the imagination of the public, if they are truly participating in creating the end product. We should promote that&#8212;it is stressed throughout the document. Page 6 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Because the purpose of architecture is to serve and sustain human life, it has all the complexities of life.\"</p><p>That is wonderful; it does. The document also says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We should develop a better understanding of the needs of building users, of their perception of space and place and of the ergonomics of use.\"</p><p>My final quotation comes from page 44, where it says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The essential and irreducible purpose of building is to meet human needs\".</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>However, something still bothered me. I asked one of the researchers to find out where the document mentions accessibility, because one of the issues about architecture that we must address is accessibility for everyone in our society, including the disabled. The researcher told me that accessibility is mentioned only on page 35. Sure enough, the word \"accessible\" is mentioned, but the document says only:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need to make the vocabulary, grammar and language of building design accessible to all.\"</p><p>That kind of talk does not make building design accessible to all. Instead of sending these glossy documents into the community, we should be offering people real choice and participation in architectural matters.<place-holder colnum=\"724\"/></p><p>I have some serious concerns about architecture and the built environment in relation to the disabled. Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 comes into operation in 2004. As building regulations apply to any new building, rehabilitation or alterations, any buildings currently planned or under way are likely to meet the criteria outlined in the act. However, the act also impacts on existing premises and covers any property that provides a service. Broadly speaking, that includes public buildings such as shops and offices. It requires that reasonable adjustments are made to properties to make them accessible to the disabled.</p><p>At this point, I want to go off on a wee tangent about the definition of disability. Architects, planners and those involved in building have too often been guilty of talking about only mobility in relation to the disabled. However, many other forms of disability are directly affected by the accessibility of buildings and the environment, and we should widen our scope on this matter.</p><p>What worries me about the enactment of part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is that 2004 is not that far away and I have not seen much publicity about the need for premises to be adapted for disabled people. The Executive must start a publicity drive to make it very plain what people need to do to adapt their premises. I would be very interested to hear from the minister whether there are any plans to do so, because I hate the thought that 2004 will come around and nothing will have been done.</p><p>Before I go any further, I should pick up on the point about the amount of time that people spend in buildings. The Royal Institution of Architects in Scotland has estimated that people spend about 90 per cent of their time in buildings which, as Ian Jenkins pointed out, include not just houses but hospitals, schools and leisure facilities. Such public buildings will need to meet certain criteria.</p><p>I have recently received many representations in Lanarkshire that the new Hairmyres hospital building might not be disabled-friendly. As I am currently investigating that issue, I cannot make a judgment on it. However, I would like the minister's reassurance that the same stringent conditions that apply to publicly procured buildings such as the new Scottish Parliament&#8212;which will have a good level of accessibility&#8212;also apply to public buildings procured through public-private partnerships and similar private sector initiatives.</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13251952", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Architecture and the Built Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would love to speak about the benefits of independence for Scotland, but I will stick to the brief.

We have to consider the wider infrastructure of the country. The planning regulations at present do not promote the regeneration of cities or their peripheral small towns.

It has been a great sadness to me that I have been unable to join a credit union where I now live. I am delighted by Cathy Jamieson's announcement, as I will again be able to become a member of a credit union.</p><p>Secondly, on volunteers day last year, when we all did our bit, I spent the day with East Kilbride Credit Union. The volunteers there work really hard, but I got totally confused when I was counting up the money and was sent to make the tea. Perhaps that is a mark of the adaptability of politicians.</p><p>Thirdly, I have been sitting on tenterhooks, as I was sure that someone&#8212;Des McNulty, perhaps, as he mentioned Dalmuir Credit Union&#8212;would bring up my third interest. During the mid-1980s, I was in the promotional video for Dalmuir Credit Union, playing the part of a Dalmuir lady who was deeply in debt. I was almost certain that someone would haul out that video and start to show it, and I am terribly glad that Des McNulty did not do so. My colleague&#8212;and friend, up until that point&#8212;Fiona Hyslop said that I should not worry, as that was so long ago that no one would recognise me.</p><p>Now that I have made all those declarations of interest, I would like to state that I am a long-time supporter of credit unions, as is the SNP. Our position has always been clear: credit unions have a valuable part to play in the development of small-banking services for people in the community whose income is too modest to be of any interest to the clearing banks and building societies. As other SNP members have said, we welcome the action plan and look forward to it being enacted.</p><p>However, it would seem that much of the action in the action plan is to be undertaken by local authorities, sometimes in conjunction with the new Scottish credit union partnership that is to be set up as part of the plan. Local authorities seem to have been given a role in areas including feasibility studies, monitoring and supervision, premises&#8212;some of which are already supplied by local authorities&#8212;membership promotion and development of teaching materials. Are those areas being funded out of the funding package that has been announced? Will on-going funding be fed through to local authorities for that work? When will the new SCUP report back and how will it report to members on its progress? I am sure that all members would like to see the development of credit unions progress quickly.</p><p>I mentioned earlier my sadness on having to leave the Clydebank credit union. That sadness resulted from the common bond and affinity that people need to have to become a credit union member. Although mutuality is important&#8212;indeed <place-holder colnum=\"685\"/> it is everything&#8212;I am concerned about how the need for it can exclude people. I live in a small town, which is just outside East Kilbride, and even though it is in the same constituency, I cannot become a member of East Kilbride Credit Union. Will the new action group look at ways to try to widen access to and accessibility of credit unions?</p><p>Members mentioned that, along with the issue of rural credit unions and how it is sometimes difficult to achieve a common bond. I would like to see a lot of discussion around how to encourage people to take part in credit unions. If that involves looking at affinity and common bonds, we will have to try to come up with a way that maintains the preciousness of where the movement started.</p><p>The minister mentioned volunteers. All members should pay tribute to the amount of work done by the volunteers who help to run credit unions; I am not nearly as cynical about that as is Bill Aitken.</p><p>One thing, however, that the minister said bothered me a wee bit&#8212;well, it did not really bother me a wee bit. She said that there can still be private money coming into credit unions and community participation. Sometimes when private money starts to come in, all of a sudden there is a regulation requiring financial bods on the management committee. I have seen that happen in housing associations. I believe and hope that that will not be put forward by the new grouping.</p><p>I am aware that we are running out of time, so I will wind up with a final worry about the FSA. Many credit unions are concerned about possible additional costs in 2002 when they have to affiliate to the FSA. Will the minister let us know what is being done to alleviate their worries?</p><p>What the Executive has come up with is great, and the speed with which it has come up with the proposals is much to be admired.

The first lot of houses in Glasgow and the inner cities were done up on the cheap through a patch-and-repair system; now we have to redo all those houses. This is a bit of a patch-and-repair housing bill, and I can see us in an independent Scotland some years down the line having to go back and fix it.

I have a great horror of codes of practice suddenly appearing after legislation is passed and I ask the Executive to consider introducing codes of practice for our consideration at stage 2. One of the problems with the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 was that the code of practice was introduced after it was passed, which meant that authorities operated it differently. We need something firm about codes of practice in the bill.</p><p>I was asked by some housing people about regulation. In my experience, strategic powers for local authorities are a great idea&#8212;as that was, and is, SNP policy, we welcome it. However, on behalf of housing associations, I make a plea that, when local authorities are given such strategic roles, existing arrangements should be sacrosanct. We should allow development programmes to be completed as agreed; it is extremely important that we do not suddenly stop plans in midstream. It is also crucial that, when those programmes are completed, housing associations should be able to sustain investment. Of course, that brings us to the right to buy, although I will address that issue in a minute. Housing associations have been made to run as businesses and a business can run properly only if its asset base is secure.<place-holder colnum=\"500\"/></p><p>I have some concerns about the cost to local authorities of the preparations that they will need to make.

Everyone in the Parliament and beyond must recognise that we have a great deal of work to do, in many fields, on sustainable development. Social inclusion must be at the heart of that. Kenneth Macintosh was right to use the quotations that he did to illustrate the fact that we can become a sustainable society only if we put people at the heart of our society.</p><p>Last year, a Scottish Natural Heritage paper spoke of achieving social well-being and equality through sustainable development&#8212;that must be the bedrock of any sustainable development policy. That is why I have some concerns about the Housing (Scotland) Bill. The bill gave us a <place-holder colnum=\"34\"/> wonderful opportunity to put sustainable development at the heart of legislation that would be of great importance to our communities. The policy memorandum says that the bill is intended to contribute to high-quality and affordable houses to rent and to purchase, and to improve the quality of Scotland's housing and deliver decent housing options for all. I am afraid, however, that the bill will not achieve that. We have ended up with a watered-down version of those great intentions. The bill deals with social housing, the right to buy and not a lot else. Except for a small increase in the powers of local authorities to make grants for improvements in the private sector and a tiny improvement in the tolerable standard, the bill fails to deliver.</p><p>The tolerable standard was introduced as far back as 1969. We need radical changes to any level of tolerable standard in housing if we are to make a difference. I think that 1969 is an appropriate time to look back to. If my memory serves me right, the Scottish Office report on sustainable development suggested a 30-year programme. We can look back at the 1960s, which was 30 years ago, and see the results of the bad housing decisions that were made then and that have resulted in absolutely appalling living conditions for many people in this country. They have also resulted in fuel poverty, which we are debating in the chamber tomorrow. All those issues are sustainable development issues. We have houses in Scotland that people cannot afford to heat and houses that people cannot afford to live in.</p><p>By chance, a magazine was delivered to me this morning. It says that, in a two-bedroom flat in Easterhouse that was built in the 1960s, heating, lighting and cooking costs the resident &#163;35 a week. It also points out that, in a two-bedroom house in Easterhouse that has recently been completed to half-decent standards, heating, lighting and cooking costs only &#163;13 a week. I cannot think of a better way to promote sustainable development than for the Scottish Parliament to decide to bite the bullet and get on with creating a housing bill that will truly make a difference to the lives of people in our community and will eradicate fuel poverty. That is not about saying that we will give all pensioners central heating if they agree to the stock transfer proposals.</p><p>We have to admit that mistakes were made in the 1960s and agree that we cannot afford to make them again. We have to look forward and set ourselves indicators and targets&#8212;one cannot measure one's grand ideas unless one measures their implementation.

The motion, like today's, was an admirable one, which the SNP was happy generally to support. It covered housing energy efficiency, a subject that is related to today's. Sadly, Robin Harper's motion was amended by the Executive in the now predictable, self-congratulatory manner. Today's motion, like Fiona McLeod's amendment, is ambitious and aspirational. That is what the Parliament and Scotland should be.</p><p>I often think that the terminology that is necessary to describe green initiatives and alternative energy strategies seems a bit futuristic and does not quite touch people in the here and now. Let us face it: if someone is living in a house that is damp and badly insulated and that they <place-holder colnum=\"1063\"/> cannot afford to heat, they will not give high priority to meeting climate change protocols or worrying about greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>There are too many people in that situation. A 1996 Scottish house conditions survey showed that almost 180,000 households use more than 20 per cent of their income on heating and hot water. Fuel poverty has always been high in Scotland, partly because of the cold, damp climate. Other European countries have similar climates&#8212;the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, for example&#8212;but Norway, Sweden and Denmark have a long-standing commitment to energy efficiency in housing, using the tools of rigorous building regulations and innovative solutions that not only improve living standards in the domestic market but strive to achieve measurable results in the reduction of energy consumption and harmful emissions. Denmark and the Netherlands have implemented successful solar energy programmes that, as we have heard, have created considerable employment.</p><p>What has happened in Scotland, however? BP has moved its solar headquarters out of Scotland and Shell announced last year its intention to cease its photovoltaic panels activities here. That is sad and shameful. Scotland has not embraced the philosophy of sustainable housing development. We have had innovative schemes here and there, which are to be applauded, but the fact is that nine out of 10 of our homes were built before the introduction of improved energy efficiency standards. Fewer than one in three homes have the desirable combination of central heating, adequate insulation and double glazing.</p><p>There is a lot of catching up to be done and a lot of serious decisions to be made about Scotland's housing stock. We have to bite the bullet and not only radically amend building regulations for new stock but be truly committed to the improvement of existing properties. Our grant system is likely to be slightly improved by the Housing (Scotland) Bill, but why not commit to real improvement and innovative solutions such as take-up grants for the installation of solar water heaters and renewable energy technology? The Executive should be providing information and incentives.</p><p>Achieving those goals would cost money. However, we should not think only of the initial capital cost, but try to achieve best value through lifetime, social and environmental costing. Our European partners in the Scandinavian countries have shown the way in developing energy-efficient homes as part of their environmental commitments. Such homes should be a central plank of our environmental, health and anti-poverty strategies. However, the long-term benefits will come only after the initial commitment and investment.

I was also pleased when the SNP tried to lodge a similar amendment to the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Bill some time ago, although it was not accepted. It should be noted that the proposed change to the law would already have been enacted if that amendment had been accepted and agreed to by the Parliament.</p><p>I have some experience, through previous work, of homelessness due to repossessions. It is fairly common for people who work in housing to come <place-holder colnum=\"258\"/> across people who, at the last minute, turn up at their door and say, \"I am going to be homeless because my house is being repossessed.\" I regret the fact that Wendy Alexander did not fulfil her statement and invite consultation on this aspect of housing in the consultation for the Housing (Scotland) Bill. It would have been good to have an all-encompassing housing bill rather than one that deals only with social housing&#8212;especially because, as the minister said, the numbers for homelessness and repossessions are rising.</p><p>In the area in which I worked, there was an especially high take-up of the right to buy, so there was proportionally less social rented housing for homelessness purposes. I find it horrifying that, in housing repossession cases in which people own their homes, local authorities can deem those people to be intentionally homeless&#8212;as if they do not pay their mortgage deliberately, rather than in situations in which they find it impossible to pay.</p><p>I was pleased to hear that Cathie Craigie is willing to consider and accept amendments at stage 2. She has already noted that some are likely to go ahead. Because I am not a member of the committee that will deal with the bill, I would like to mention a couple of aspects of it for clarification, with the intention of possible future amendment.</p><p>My first point seems fairly minor, but people who work in housing would say that it is major. Many members have mentioned that folk bury their heads in the sand when they are faced with the repossession of a rented house or the repossession of an owned house by lenders. The bill says that notices will be served by recorded delivery. Although that sounds good and proof can be obtained of the receipt of that notice, there can be no proof that the person who has received a recorded delivery letter has opened the envelope, let alone read and understood its contents.</p><p>I have known cases when notices have simply been ripped up and thrown in the bin without being read&#8212;the ostrich syndrome. I wonder whether discussions at stage 2 could focus on how we can ensure that people realise what is likely to happen to them. It should not be about simply ensuring that they receive a letter.</p><p>My second point is that I would like consideration to be given to section 24 of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970, whereby people can be taken to court by the lender for refusing to participate in maintenance of their property. That can be a big problem in tenement property, where there is common ownership of some aspects of the accommodation. I would like that part of the bill to be considered in more detail and perhaps expanded. There is a proposal for tenement law to be revised, and the matter could be addressed as <place-holder colnum=\"259\"/> part of that revision.</p><p>Cathie Craigie and other members mentioned that there should be some form of amendment concerning the Council of Mortgage Lenders, as some lenders have good codes of practice, but we should not forget that lenders also have obligations. The onus is on lenders to be realistic about people's abilities to make payments when they set the level of the loan. That applies particularly when new houses are sold with mortgages covering fixtures, fittings and carpets. In such cases, people can end up paying a mortgage over 25 years for a fridge. That is a bad practice and lenders should take a look at themselves in relation to it.</p><p>Government also has a responsibility. I repeat what the minister told us today: repossession and homelessness are increasing. Maybe home ownership is not the answer to everyone's prayers. While many aspire to home ownership, for many people that aspiration can never be a reality. We should recognise that fact and the Government in Scotland should admit it and rethink its strategy of attaining 80 per cent home ownership. It should also reconsider the proposed extension of the right to buy, which will negatively affect the stock of some of the landlords in Scotland who play an active role in rehousing those who have their houses repossessed.</p><p>My last comments aside, I warmly welcome the bill and look forward to its next stage in the Scottish Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2001-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13242674", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I welcome the introduction of this bill and congratulate Cathie Craigie on it.

Our party's position has long been that a national strategy is necessary and we are pleased that this Parliament has produced a working document. I say that the Parliament produced a working document, but not as an attempt to do down the Executive in any way. The Minister for Social Justice mentioned the cross-party consensus on this matter and it is important that the whole Parliament takes ownership of this issue and moves it forward.</p><p>Over the past couple of weeks, the SNP has criticised the Executive's strategy papers on social justice and equality. I want Parliament to understand that our position was born not out of disregard for the fine principles in those strategies, but out of the frustration that we feel that, under the devolution settlement, we do not have the powers truly to implement them. That is not so this time. It is wonderful that, this time, the Parliament has the powers to address one of the biggest problems facing Scotland. With the commitment of all members, I am optimistic about the results.</p><p>However, we should not get carried away and start to believe that the problem can be sorted quickly and simply by cash injection. We should recognise that the strategy must be implemented in two main areas: we have to deal with the symptoms, which can be alleviated in the short term, and we have to tackle the root causes, which is a long-term goal. As the minister said, the strategy's aims define those as the three Ps&#8212;prevention, protection and provision. Today's funding package will go a long way towards provision, and the consistency of that funding must be maintained. I was glad that that was detailed in the minister's speech. However, protection and prevention are a lot more difficult.</p><p>Earlier this afternoon, it was made clear that many of us have huge concerns about the weaknesses in our criminal justice system and its seeming inability to cope fairly and equitably with all those involved in it, either as victim or as alleged perpetrator. We have generally recognised that institutional racism exists in our country and that it is often implicit rather than explicit. I think that, to some extent, the same can be said of institutional sexism. I have been appalled by some <place-holder colnum=\"434\"/> of the recent decisions of the judiciary. We hear of a man who received only 200 hours of community service after raping his estranged wife, despite a record of previous violence. Another man received two years' probation and 200 hours of community service after stabbing his estranged wife. Something is very wrong when a Scottish judge justifies his sentencing decision because a stabbing was, in the judge's words to the perpetrator,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a reaction on your part to a very distressing set of circumstances created by the victim herself.\"</p><p>Surely no set of circumstances can invite such violence. If such attitudes persist at the highest level, how can any woman be confident of protection? If we want to influence prevention of domestic abuse, the shortcomings of our institutions must be examined and their structures must be seriously revised.</p><p>There is a distinct lack of female representation in the judicial system. Scotland has 32 judges, of whom only two are women. The first was appointed only in 1996. When I discovered that this morning, I was amazed. Of 128 permanent sheriffs, only 18 are female, and of 40 procurators fiscal, only five are female. Similar figures apply to high-ranked police officers, as I have said before.</p><p>The minister said that the education process must start as early as possible. I was pleased to note the action plan for education and training in the strategy. In summing up, will the minister explain how the curricular content of the pilot project that is being set up in Edinburgh primary schools fits into the curricular framework? When is the pilot study intended to finish, so that we can implement the plan in all schools?</p><p>We must find ways of teaching our children that we are all equally valuable. We all have the same right to expect our lives to be free from abuse, violence and discrimination, regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. We must also recognise that violence can be caused not only by an abuse of power, but by feelings of powerlessness or inadequacy and by lack of self-control. I hope that we will be imaginative in teaching our children. We should not underestimate their understanding of the issues.</p><p>Last year, George Lyon and I visited a seminar day at Dunoon Grammar School. First-year pupils were being given citizenship training as an introduction to secondary schooling. Presentations from the local Scottish Women's Aid group and other voluntary agencies were incorporated. We should consider teaching such matters as anger management, self-control and self-worth. That is probably the long-term road to prevention of abuse.</p><p>The strategy that the Parliament has produced <place-holder colnum=\"435\"/> against domestic abuse should be welcomed. It contains a lot of good stuff, but the debate should not stop now just because we feel that we have achieved something. As consistent and planned funding is necessary, so is consistent and planned monitoring and improvement. I was pleased when the minister announced that a national group is to be set up in early 2001 to monitor the plan. She also referred to the Zero Tolerance Trust report. Perhaps the Parliament could consider whether such a report could be compiled on a regular basis, as a way of tracking changing attitudes and charting the progress of our strategy.</p><p>I close with a reaffirmation of the SNP's commitment to tackling the pain and problems caused by domestic abuse in any form and aimed at any person. I trust that members will all help to make real progress in the implementation of the Parliament's strategy to address domestic abuse in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13239573", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Domestic Abuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The SNP commends the members of the Scottish partnership on domestic abuse on the report, and all the agencies and individuals that contributed to and informed the debate over the piece.

It struck me that we are seeing consensus politics in action in the Scottish Parliament, as the Executive seems to be agreeing with the SNP's ideas. Long may that continue.</p><p>The SNP would go further, however, as we agree with the Local Government Committee and other commentators that a full review of local government is needed. Our membership agreed that policy. I hope that this announcement, although welcome, will be deemed to be interim and that Angus MacKay, unlike Jack McConnell, will agree that a full and comprehensive review of local government finance is required. Much could be achieved by such a review. I believe that Bristow Muldoon has already mentioned the continuing problem with local government workers' wages&#8212;we all know about Unison's days of action. That issue should be brought into the review.</p><p>We should also record the idea of a contingency fund, which Gil Paterson mentioned. Anyone who has visited schools in their constituencies will have seen that we have many school buildings that were built in the boom time of the 1960s and which are now coming to the end of their natural lives and will fall down unless they receive huge investment.</p><p>We could consider the reasons for some recent local government actions, such as the cuts in the home-help service, which average out across Scotland at 11.5 per cent. The poorest and most deprived areas were particularly hit: Glasgow had a cut of around 20 per cent. We have an opportunity to consider many such issues and to think about how we could create the best funding framework to deliver local government services.</p><p>Des McNulty talked about having a comprehensive review of expenditure throughout Scotland, from the level of the Executive down to local councils. Having worked in the voluntary sector&#8212;for housing associations that were funded by Scottish Homes&#8212;I can see that the need for that is great. It would be good if those agencies <place-holder colnum=\"278\"/> were able to deal with a three-year funding programme and did not have to go through the annual scramble for funds and deal with the bidding process that becomes a competition that uses up valuable staff time that could be used to deal with the issues that the voluntary agencies are set up to deal with.</p><p>I hope that Mr Peacock will make clear whether, as well as councils being funded for three years, a recommendation will be made to councils that they grant the voluntary sector funding on a three-year basis. That would make it easier for voluntary organisations to get match funding when the Executive tells them that they can get a certain amount only if the council grants them the same.</p><p>When talking about three-year funding, the minister said that grant support could increase where there were deemed to be new burdens or a transfer of responsibility. I understand that, but I want to know whether it would be possible for a council to increase its council tax in the three-year period if, for example, the Executive said that it could not fund a particular burden.

That is a great excuse, which the Executive uses over and over to allow it to set easy-to-achieve objectives and then wallow in self-congratulatory trumpet blowing.</p><p>It is not only the SNP that recognises that. I enjoyed Donald Gorrie's contribution. He said clearly that benefit reforms were much needed. Would not it be wonderful if we could take that idea by the throat and shake it here in Scotland, rather than having to run down to Westminster all the time? Tommy Sheridan mentioned unemployment and poverty traps, which are a direct result of our benefits system and unfair <place-holder colnum=\"49\"/> taxation system.</p><p>My colleague Fiona Hyslop hinted earlier at concerns that the Executive was manipulating targets to suit itself and to make them easier to achieve. That is best illustrated by the watering down of the 50 indicators with specific measurements that were devised by an evaluation framework team, led by Scottish Executive officials. They were watered down into 28 weaker and vaguer social justice targets; the other 22 indicators were ignored altogether. I suggest that those indicators were ignored because they made for uncomfortable reading.

Irene McGugan showed us how the child strategy has not delivered, and I am not sure whether we can ensure that the equality strategy will deliver without enhancing the Parliament's powers to embrace legislative competence for equal opportunities.</p><p>Meanwhile, is the Government of Scotland prepared to use the additional powers under section L2 of schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 again and again, as Fiona Hyslop said, to impose duties that would ensure compliance with the strategy? I hope so, but even such action would not go far enough.</p><p>There has been much talk today about <place-holder colnum=\"1453\"/> institutional racism in relation to crime. At about this time last year, I submitted a written question about the percentage of female officers at each rank in each Scottish police force and in the Scottish Crime Squad. The answer showed how far we must still go in Scotland to ensure equality of opportunity between men and women. At that time, Strathclyde police was the only force in Scotland to have women officers above the rank of superintendent. The figures for the Scottish Crime Squad were even more damning. Of its constables, 16.6 per cent were female, and no officers above that rank were female. I suspect that even though targets have been published and established, there has not been much movement in the past year.</p><p>In public office, women are under-represented. Fewer than 25 per cent of councillors are female and there are just over 36 per cent of us in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>We know that women earn only 72 per cent of men's average weekly wage and are more vulnerable to poverty than men. We know&#8212;Elaine Smith mentioned it&#8212;the horrendous figures associated with domestic violence towards women.</p><p>Another disadvantaged group are the people whose sexual orientation does not match the norm, as dictated by our society. In Scotland, approximately 150,000 people are gay or lesbian. I was horrified at the findings&#8212;noted by Fiona Hyslop&#8212;that nearly a third of gay men and lesbians believe that their educational achievements were negatively affected by attitudes to their sexuality.</p><p>I heartily applaud the repeal of section 2A as an equality measure, but it is not enough to eradicate, for example, homophobic bullying in our schools. Schools in England and Wales were surveyed on that question: 82 per cent of schools surveyed were aware of homophobic bullying but only 6 per cent referred to the unacceptability of such attacks in their anti-bullying policies. I have no reason to believe that the situation in Scottish schools would be any different were such a survey to be conducted here.</p><p>I can accept that awareness raising, as mentioned by the minister, is important. I can accept that awareness raising and promotion of good policy in society is necessary, across the board, for all disadvantaged groups. What I cannot accept is that that is enough. Firm action is required. The minister's answer to Fiona McLeod's question about the inadequacies of the Transport (Scotland) Bill in relation to the disabled proved that in Scotland we are to be allowed only good intentions, rather than laws.</p><p>If this Parliament is serious about equal <place-holder colnum=\"1454\"/> opportunities as a cornerstone of social justice, it must recognise that we cannot properly build social justice in this country without equal opportunities legislation, or while such legislation is reserved to Westminster.

I asked this question before, but it was never answered, so I will ask it again: why does the core funding for the municipal arts contribute substantially to the wages and fees of performers of those art forms while there is little support for the performers of traditional music? Adequate core funding is what is required.

Such an initiative should also ensure that a national public transport timetable is implemented, which is coupled with improvements in bus and rail connections to airports and ferry terminals and, as Robert Brown mentioned, through-ticketing.</p><p>Those admirable statements of intent, with which the Scottish National Party agrees, were made in July 1998 by our First Minister when he had John Reid's job&#8212;I am quoting Donald Dewar from \"Travel Choices for Scotland\".</p><p>What do we have now? We have a crisis in our country, which was well addressed yesterday by many of my colleagues, but which can be properly addressed only when the Westminster Government wakes up to the fact that the public have rumbled its game of raising tax revenue from fuel and motorists to fund vital public services.</p><p>We also have a transport bill that does not address any of the objectives to which Donald Dewar referred in July 1998. Those objectives have been watered down so that we now have an excuse for a transport policy. Despite the hype and the rhetoric, we have a bill that covers only one mode of transport: buses. The minister says that train information is coming soon. How about some integration of research on policy?</p><p>The bill enables the establishment of local transport strategies, but is not backed up by a national strategy. Even the travel concession <place-holder colnum=\"313\"/> schemes are not proposed on a national, let alone an international, basis. Why should an international travel concession scheme not be possible?</p><p>Part 3 of the bill enables road user and workplace parking charging. The key word is \"enables\"; perhaps it would be more honest to say \"delegates\", as what the bill enables is the buck to be passed yet again to local authorities. Cost implications are noted in the financial memorandum, but&#8212;as is becoming the norm for the Executive&#8212;no realistic note is given of how costs will be met.</p><p>As many members have pointed out, this is a bus bill. Even on buses, the bill is disingenuous. It mentions choice for local authorities in providing bus services, and the minister talked today about local solutions for local needs. However, there is no real choice; quality partnerships must come first. Indeed, Cathy Jamieson expressed concern about that. In the bill, a quality contract will be introduced only when a quality partnership fails, and only then with the Executive's permission. So much for the fine words about freedom of choice for local authorities; surely those best placed to make decisions about local bus services are in the locality of such services. Try telling people in East Kilbride, Kilmarnock or Hamilton that the minister knows more about their bus services than they do.</p><p>At the Transport and the Environment Committee on 21 June 2000, the minister said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I do not want all the local authorities in Scotland to follow their first instincts and go for contracts.\"</p><p>Although the minister recognises that local authorities know what is needed, they will not be allowed to implement it.</p><p>At the same meeting, the minister said that she worried about re-regulation of the bus service. So what? Is the Labour party admitting that it was wrong to denounce the Tories for privatising the buses? How can anyone have faith in new Labour today?</p><p>Furthermore, the minister is not totally confident about her proposals for bus services. She said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If every local authority had contracts . . . there would be only one bus company on each route.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report, Transport and the Environment Committee</i>, 21 June 2000; c 717-18.]</p><p>Not according to the policy memorandum, which mentions a \"single operator\" or \"group of operators\".</p><p>Proposals for workplace parking charges have been cobbled together and are, as the Transport and the Environment Committee recognised, clearly unworkable. I am glad that the minister has agreed to issue more details on issues such as exemptions.<place-holder colnum=\"314\"/></p><p>The Executive talks a lot about joined-up government; however, let us consider the reality. National planning policy guidelines insist on parking provision for employees and visitors as part of any development. However, we will now charge employers for the spaces for which they were obliged to take responsibility in the first place. Will the planning review take that point on board?</p><p>The workplace parking charge is in fact an extra tax on business. Gavin Scott of the Freight Transport Association told the committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is not a workplace parking levy . . . it is a visitors' . . . and everything else parking levy.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report, Transport and the Environment Committee</i>, 21 June 2000; c 773.]</p><p>There is no disincentive for the vehicle driver, and we all know that carrots work better than sticks. Where is the carrot to the employers and the motorists?</p><p>Janis Hughes asked about exemptions for hospitals. However, public buildings and further education colleges are already strapped for cash. Many mature and part-time students use their cars when they go to college. Will the colleges have to pay the tax for the spaces used by students as well as by staff? Perhaps we should get innovative and consider renting out car parking spaces owned by companies and colleges for park-and-ride facilities, assuming that we can get decent bus services first.</p><p>I am convinced that, like motorway tolling, workplace parking charges will be dropped. Both policies were lifted directly from our nearest neighbours and are inappropriate and unworkable in Scotland. They are not Scottish solutions to Scottish problems.</p><p>Congestion is a huge problem in Scottish cities. As many members have said, we cannot walk away from our responsibilities. However, although there is a case for congestion charging in cities, it can work only if alternative modes of transport are in place first. Councils have obligations; the public know the score; what we need is some national guidance to cut congestion and resulting emissions. We need a transport policy with targets for reducing climate change emissions and levels of traffic, and I ask the minister actively to consider that suggestion as the bill progresses.</p><p>I have heard nothing today that gives me much confidence that the bill will result in any real solutions for Scotland's transport problems and environmental responsibilities. As Kenny MacAskill said, the SNP will support any serious attempt to integrate transport in Scotland and to fulfil our international obligations to the world's environment. However, we should not pretend that there is any way to achieve those ends other than <place-holder colnum=\"315\"/> by real commitment to the carrot before the stick.

There are call centres that handle 999 calls all over Britain. When a call is placed, it goes to an operator who determines the service that is needed and rings the appropriate agency. On pick-up, the call is the responsibility of the emergency services. On average 26 million emergency calls are made every year in the UK and 50 per cent of those calls are screened out as being non-emergency. In some areas of Scotland, nearly 10 per cent of 999 calls are abusive, nonsense, malicious or a hoax. That affects all three emergency services. Only this month, the Parliament's Audit Committee reported severe problems with hoax calls to the Ambulance Service. Such abuse has expanded over the past five years as mobile phone ownership has increased.</p><p>However, not all non-emergency calls are malicious. The increase in ownership of mobile phones has caused specific problems to the emergency services, which have been much publicised lately. Non-emergency calls may be the result of 999 being dialled accidentally, if, for example, a phone is stuffed in a bag or a pocket&#8212;999 calls can be made from mobile phones even if the number lock is on. Lothian and Borders police deals with up to 50 unintentional calls a day. That is the background to the substance of my motion.<place-holder colnum=\"988\"/></p><p>As a response to the problem, individual police forces are carrying out their own campaigns to minimise the number of non-emergency calls. Some members will have heard the recent commercials on radio, publicising the campaign that is being jointly managed by three of Scotland's police forces. I can understand why the police feel it necessary to educate telephone users in the proper use of the system, just as I can understand the frustration that operators must feel when they are dealing with a potential hoax, a silent caller or a routine inquiry, knowing that someone else may be genuinely at risk and is not being dealt with.</p><p>That raises two issues. First, surely in this day and age the technology exists to deal with such calls quickly, perhaps by diverting them to a non-emergency line for call tracing. Secondly, we must consider the individual who telephones 999. Whatever the rise in the number of hoax calls, unintentional calls and so on, most people who ring 999 do so for genuine reasons.</p><p>Although the stark definition of an emergency as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"threat to life or limb, or an ongoing serious incident requiring immediate police assistance\"</p><p>may be logical in the cold light of day, in times of stress or danger such logic is unlikely to be applied. One of the great strengths of our police force lies in the fact that people who are in danger, or who perceive themselves to be in danger, automatically want a policeman. Whatever criticism is made of our police&#8212;justified or unjustified&#8212;we should do nothing to jeopardise such a relationship between the public and the police.</p><p>Members may have seen the reports of my recent experience in which I encountered road rage at first hand. Indeed, that was the incident that sparked off this debate. I shall say what happened in brief: 999 was called and the response that was given was such that we felt uncomfortable about having made the call. The point is that I felt threatened and in the circumstances it was impractical to look up the number of the local police station in a telephone book or to phone directory inquiries. Since the event, I have received correspondence that suggests that several other people have had similar experiences.</p><p>It must be recognised that, when a caller feels threatened and calls 999 to ask for the police, for that caller the situation is real and an emergency. It worries me that, in our attempt to minimise hoax and meaningless calls, we will discourage genuine callers, who may now feel that they will be assumed to be stupid for making such a call.</p><p>With the advent of the car telephone, people can more easily call the police if they feel that <place-holder colnum=\"989\"/> something is worth reporting, such as a situation or incident where police action would be advantageous. I recently had a conversation with a constituent who, driving on the A71 on a stormy night, noticed that a temporary traffic light had blown over and felt that that could have caused a road accident. He did not know the number of Strathaven police station and admitted that he had not phoned directory inquiries because that would have cost &#163;2.50 on his mobile phone. He spent the rest of the evening worrying that he should have reported the incident and that an accident might have occurred that he could have averted.</p><p>In such situations, it would be an advantage to have a national contact number for the police to enable call diversion to a local police station. That service would be fairly easy to implement and, given adequate advertising, would not only assist the general public but, in time, lessen the number of non-emergency calls to the emergency police service. Many years ago in Glasgow, all police stations had the phone number 1113, preceded by the appropriate area code, which made it easy to telephone those stations. Many police officers to whom I have spoken support the idea of such a central telephone point. Lothian and Borders police has suggested a national police inquiry line and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland supports the idea, despite understandable reservations about funding.</p><p>My motion&#8212;which, for the record, is motion S1M-999&#8212;is therefore clear.

Lack of funding is the primary reason for the demise of not only the Edinburgh Folk Festival but many such initiatives over the years. What has been lacking is a national framework for the development of our traditional arts, or a national strategy such as that operated in countries such as Spain and Ireland. In Ireland, the traditional culture, which is very similar to ours, has been cherished at all levels, resulting in a great pride in the country's indigenous music and dance, which is complementary to their wonderful poetry and prose tradition, both oral and written.</p><p>The national cultural strategy is out for consultation. Within that, I would like there to be active promotion of and a commitment to adequate funding for our traditional arts and recognition of their long-term advantages&#8212;advantages not only to our country's children, but to the economic value to its tourism, businesses and media.</p><p>I mention children because when I have attended any event where youngsters are introduced to the instruments, voices and dance steps of their heritage, they love it&#8212;every minute of it.

The raft of small purses of money available&#8212;lottery and new opportunities funding and so on&#8212;does not serve the purpose. No traditional arts organisation in this country is funded to anything like the level that would allow it adequately to carry out its core tasks, let alone to prepare the extensive and time-consuming applications required to secure partnership and sponsorship. The core tasks are what are important&#8212;that must be recognised and matched with core funding.

Why does the core funding for the municipal arts contribute substantially to the wages and fees of performers of those art forms while there is, at present, no direct and very little indirect support from the Scottish Arts Council for the performers of traditional music?

Straw has created an environment in which the Tories can begin, once more, to play the race card.

We should be promoting the sustainable use of our natural resources&#8212;Scotland has special qualities, which should be understood and enjoyed&#8212;and we should be promoting economic and social development throughout the country.</p><p>It is our belief that each national park should be established through legislation that is unique to each area. However, what has been presented by the Executive and well discussed by committees is enabling legislation. The SNP will be constructive in its attempts to ensure that the bill delivers the best possible framework for the secondary legislation that will follow, which will be specific to each area that is affected.</p><p>National parks are national assets, and we all have obligations towards the preservation of our environment. We must also look after the interests <place-holder colnum=\"998\"/> of the local communities that are affected. I take this opportunity to welcome David Green, the convener of Highland Council, who is here with friends. The Parliament should think about repaying the compliment by holding a debate on a later stage of the bill in Badenoch and Strathspey or Loch Lomond and the Trossachs.</p><p>SNP members have some concerns about the bill, which have been raised in the appropriate committees. I shall outline those concerns now, and my colleagues will expand on them. The main thrust of our concern is on matters of consultation, representation and funding.</p><p>At an early stage, once the enabling legislation is in place, proposals will be brought forward for parks to be established in specific areas. We have concerns about the process at that stage. On the receipt of a national park proposal, the reporter, who will be chosen by the Executive, must send a copy of the proposal to every local authority that will be affected, and must, under the bill,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"determine the period for which the copy proposal and requirement are to be made available for public inspection\".</p><p>The stated method of publicising the proposal is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"as the reporter thinks fit\".</p><p>Those powers remain with the Scottish ministers if a reporter is not appointed; as the bill stands, the length of that consultation could be merely a week.</p><p>I do not for a minute doubt the minister's integrity in this matter, but the legislation will stand in our statute book for years to come. We must ensure that an adequate consultation period is established for the future. The framework must be solid. I am pleased that the Minister for Transport and the Environment conceded that point in committee and I look forward to her specifying today the minimum period that will be required for community consultation on each national park proposal.</p><p>On the designation orders, the bill requires that the secondary legislation must be given at least six weeks of consultation before its submission to Parliament. Three parliamentary committees and other respondents to the consultation exercise expressed concern about proper scrutiny of the designation orders. The minister should take those concerns on board. She should consider the recommendations that have been made and reconsider the current proposals so that they allow for proper scrutiny and transparency.</p><p>Following consultation, a national park authority will be set up. \"Set up\" is indeed the correct term. Schedule 1 to the bill clearly lays down the rules for membership of the authorities. Half the members will be appointed by the Scottish ministers and half will be appointed on the nomination of local authorities. There is no <place-holder colnum=\"999\"/> provision to ensure that members of the communities that will be directly affected by the national parks are appointed or nominated to sit on the national park authorities, which will, essentially, govern the area.</p><p>We will have more quangos. The Scottish Government will take on the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland prior to devolution&#8212;the role of making appointments. It has been argued that the local authority nominations will provide for local representation, but the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has conceded that the local authority appointees are likely all to be local authority councillors. What about the community councils? What about those who live and work in national parks? There is no guarantee that they will be represented.

The number of advisory groups and committees could, therefore, be limited, which would also cut local people's ability to voice directly their opinions on the governance of their communities. Surely that cannot be acceptable. The bill makes assumptions about community membership and involvement but does not specifically support it. The minister said in committee that we might be able to add some \"local flavour\"&#8212;as she put it&#8212;to the national park and designation orders through consultation with local people. That is not enough&#8212;the minister must think again. Flexibility is fine, but the rights of local communities should be enshrined in legislation.</p><p>I know that my colleagues will speak about those issues in greater depth, so I will move on to funding. We cannot, I admit, know the precise cost of each park and I know that we must rely on projections. It seems to me, however, that the complete picture has not been fully scrutinised&#8212;neither have all reasonable questions been answered. The Executive has pledged to pay the entire cost of the parks. Will the funding come from the funding for other rural and environmental plans, or will the local authorities in the areas suffer cuts so that the parks can be funded? What about the additional costs that local authorities might incur&#8212;for example, for their roads infrastructure and higher-quality development requirements? Do the figures that we have been <place-holder colnum=\"1000\"/> shown include the funding that might be necessary for national park authorities to buy land immediately they are established? Those questions must all be answered. The main question, however, is whether there really will be new money.</p><p>The matter of planning and development is also relevant to local authorities. The bill must be clear about which body is responsible for planning functions. Will it be the local authority or the national park authority? Those who live in the park areas and whose livelihoods will be affected have expressed valid concerns. We must get this right and I urge the minister again to take on board the concerns that have been raised and the recommendations that have been made by committees in that regard. It is of the utmost importance that the economic well-being of those who live and work in the parks is protected.</p><p>Planning and economic issues might result in disputes. It is intrinsic to the bill that conservation will prevail, under what is commonly referred to as the Sandford principle. We should ensure from the start that in cases of conflict a clear policy is put in place and that a recognised system of conflict resolution can be followed. There must be a measured and reasonable process that can be gone through during conflicts to avoid hostility between local people, local authorities, park authorities and the Parliament.</p><p>I am also concerned that, on matters of environment and conservation, we might be in danger of focusing all our efforts on national parks. In \"Making it work together: A programme for government\", the Executive promised to introduce a whole new system of nature conservation in Scotland. We must ensure that such aims remain for our country as a whole.</p><p>My final point concerns marine national parks. Scottish Natural Heritage had to come clean and admit that it did not start by considering a purely marine park. The minister told the Transport and the Environment Committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our legislation will be targeted at a terrestrial concept, and at terrestrial law, which might not be appropriate for marine parks.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report, Transport and the Environment Committee</i>, 8 September 1999; c 21.]</p><p>I believe that there is genuine recognition, including from the minister today, that not enough consultation has been carried out on the concept of marine national parks, especially where there is no terrestrial element.</p><p>The Rural Affairs Committee considered this matter in great detail, and I know that members of that committee will make contributions to today's debate.

There is a danger that we see the city only as a problem; it is also a great opportunity.</p><p>I have heard it suggested that the potential of west central Scotland could be realised without tackling Glasgow's decline. I do not agree. Doing so would not be in the interest of the adjacent communities either. Glasgow should be the hub of west central Scotland. It is a major resource for employment, shopping and other services and provides up to a quarter of a million jobs, with earnings above the Scottish average. The city has a positive as well as negative international reputation. Its shopping, leisure and service sectors are developing apace. Officials and politicians wax lyrical about the remaking of the city.</p><p>A number of years ago I was involved in a housing campaign that many here will remember, with the slogan \"Glasgow's Miles Better&#8212;Miles to go\". That remains an apt summary of Glasgow today.</p><p>Part of the city's international reputation is based on its community-based housing associations' work in regenerating the inner city. It is ironic that, 25 years after they started that work, in many parts of Glasgow the Executive's commitment to social inclusion is being drowned out by the return of the bulldozer as an instrument of urban policy.</p><p>Even without the addition of further sites, the backlog of vacant and derelict land undermines the city's competitiveness. Glasgow contains almost a quarter of Scotland's vacant derelict urban land. Although it is worse in Glasgow, the problem of derelict land is Scotland-wide. Almost 40 per cent of Scotland's vacant and derelict land has lain unused for at least 20 years. The minister has identified that the present situation is a waste of resources; the question is, when will concerted action be taken to tackle the problem?</p><p>In its stock transfer plan, Glasgow City Council identified proposals to demolish up to 15,000 properties. If that programme is badly handled, that scale of demolition will represent a major risk to the city. The evidence from previous clearance programmes is that, when people are detached from their communities, it is difficult to determine where they will settle. Neither the city nor Scotland can afford the continuing draining away of Glasgow's population. Between 1981 and 1996, Glasgow suffered a net population loss of 95,000, which is clearly the principal component of Scotland's net loss of 52,000 people during the same period. Members will be aware that <place-holder colnum=\"688\"/> Professor Arthur Midwinter has warned that, if that process continues, the city's finances will be unsustainable.</p><p>Despite the warnings, I remain optimistic about Glasgow, which has been called the city that refused to die.

The first report of the Transport and the Environment Committee is the result of a great deal of investigation. Committee members have worked well; they have achieved consensus and a result that, if implemented, would be in the best interests of the people of Scotland.</p><p>It is regrettable that the summary report of the Stewart inquiry was not available to members until this morning, particularly given that the media was telephoning me&#8212;and I presume other members of the committee&#8212;last night, asking for comment on the report, which had been issued to them. I would have thought that the Executive and the Government in London would have realised by now that journalistic spin is not an acceptable alternative to democratic accountability. However, that is an on-going issue, which the Scottish Parliament will have to deal with properly in the near future.</p><p>Today, we are dealing with the proliferation of mobile telephone masts across our country and the legitimate concerns surrounding that issue. All members will have had some representation from concerned parents about masts being erected near schools, or from people who have arrived home to find themselves in the shadow of such a mast. As our convener said, in some cases, such as Lister Tower in East Kilbride, the masts are erected on the buildings themselves. In all those cases, there are valid concerns about the reports of potential adverse effects on health and the impact on the visual environment.</p><p>The Transport and the Environment Committee tackled the task of reporting on those concerns very seriously. We took evidence from a range of bodies during the inquiry; we received more than 100 written submissions and heard evidence from 20 organisations and individuals. The report was agreed unanimously and our main conclusion is that the erection of masts for mobile telephones should be a matter for full planning controls. That is the only way in which the views and concerns of people most directly affected by the masts can be properly addressed.<place-holder colnum=\"532\"/></p><p>In addition, planning authorities confirm that the work load for councils is almost exactly the same for planning applications as it is for the prior approval system previously favoured by the Executive. However, the suggested fees for the prior approval system are lower. If the auction of licences to the industry can rake in &#163;22 billion for Gordon Brown's daily inflating war chest, why should Scottish councils have to subsidise the same industry's on-going approvals?</p><p>Health, environment and the right of the public to notification and consultation are just some of the reasons why I have concerns about the Executive's seeming reluctance to accept in full the recommendations of the committee. I suspect that the Executive will now move some way towards full planning controls, but I am concerned about the statement issued by the minister in which she worries about neighbour notification. The people who live in the areas where masts are being erected have the right to prior notification and to have input into the siting of such masts.</p><p>The minister is adamant that we should not lose sight of the beneficial effects of the expansion of the mobile phone system. However, I am confident that local authorities, local government officers and, most important, the people who have to live, work, play and go to school in the shadow of the masts have the intelligence and wit to weigh up the pros and cons of where those masts are sited. After all, who knows the needs of an area better than the people who live and work there?</p><p>I exercise the precautionary principle in welcoming the Executive's response that it intends to move some way towards the committee's recommendations. I give a cautious welcome to the minister's announcement to the press on Tuesday that she will act quickly in examining the matter. However, I contend that the matter has already been examined&#8212;by the Transport and the Environment Committee and by the Stewart inquiry.

In East Kilbride, even the buoyant mobile phone sector has suffered almost 200 job losses at Vodafone.</p><p>Many people in Scotland, including voters in next week's by-election, take a different view from that of Dr John Reid and his cohorts. The message that is coming through strongly is that Scotland is fed up with a union that delivers stable but steady economic decline.</p><p>If the minister were here, I would remind him&#8212;in his absence, I shall remind his deputy instead&#8212;of the words that he spoke during the initial debate on this topic on 29 September last year. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are preparing an overall economic strategy for Scotland. Our manufacturing strategy will be set in that context.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/1999-09-29.809.1\">[<i>Official Report</i>, 29 September 1999; Vol 2, c 811.]</citation></p><p>Reactions to the minister's document demonstrate how far it is from the strategy that he tells us he wants to put in place. The responses have concentrated on the major issues that affect our manufacturing sector, and especially on the strength of sterling, which, if it continues, will undermine all this Parliament's efforts.<place-holder colnum=\"555\"/></p><p>I shall revert briefly to my interest in housing. It is a widely shared view that an obsession with owner-occupation is one of the factors that force up interest rates in the UK and undermine manufacturing investment. Perhaps the minister could have a word with his colleague the Minister for Communities and persuade her of the merits of a well-functioning housing market, instead of pushing more and more people into marginal owner-occupation. Perhaps he could also have a word with the UK Prime Minister this afternoon and ask him whether Scottish manufacturing jobs are a price worth paying for cooling the economy in London and the south-east.</p><p>I make a plea for this Parliament to take globalisation seriously. The results of globalisation are already with us. As an example, I refer again to Philips Lighting in Hamilton. The 223 jobs that are disappearing from Scotland will be relocated in Poland. Over the next few years, no other issue will have as much impact on our manufacturing base as globalisation will, and the minister referred to that in his speech of 29 September and again this morning. It is all very well for the minister to refer to those matters, but if this Parliament has no arrangements to monitor international developments, he might as well not bother.</p><p>I make no apology for drawing attention once again to developments around the World Trade Organisation. It is time that this Parliament established a committee to monitor the WTO and other international developments. When that happens, this Parliament might be able to make a serious effort to develop a plan for manufacturing, rather than simply approving reports on what the Executive is doing to cope with the problems created by its Westminster colleagues.

Parental rights are important, but in a civilised society a child's right to protection must take precedence over a parent's right to chastise. I look forward with interest to the outcome of the consultation; I hope to hear the views of parents and young people, rather than those of the professional reactionaries.</p><p>Before dealing with my principal concern, I want to state my doubts about having a complete ban on the physical chastisement of children, even by parents. Although I welcome the intention to make progress in this area, I am not yet convinced that an outright ban is either justified or practical. I draw members' attention to the findings of the MORI poll that was conducted on behalf of the Children are Unbeatable! campaign. The poll found that 78 per cent of parents and young people believed that children should have the same protection under the law on assault, provided that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"they can be sure that parents will not be prosecuted for trivial smacks.\"</p><p>I take on board Scott Barrie's point that the threat of such prosecution might be an erroneous perception; however, the perception exists and must be tackled.</p><p>Although, after much consideration, I endorse the views expressed by that 78 per cent of people, the law must be more comprehensive and must take account of the situation where other adults find themselves in a parental role. The issue is how we proceed in a way that achieves cohesion, a greater understanding of the issues and a better future for our young people.</p><p>Although much in the consultation document is commendable, the Executive has not yet properly focused on the rights and interests of the child. That is most clearly illustrated by the debate about protection for children who are in child care centres and private pre-school centres, and who are looked after by child minders. I commend to the Executive the application of the non-discriminatory approach to children's rights contained in the 1989 UN Convention on the <place-holder colnum=\"126\"/> Rights of the Child.</p><p>During the consultation, we must consider whether it is acceptable to ban corporal punishment of children in publicly funded pre-school centres while permitting the same punishment of children in privately funded pre-school centres. From the perspective of children, I can see no justification for such an approach. I question the equity of some children losing their right to protection from assault simply because their parents belong to a certain social or economic group. Human rights, including those of children, should not be removable through the application of a cheque book.</p><p>The Executive's position that we should move forward with legislation at a different pace in the public sector from that in the private sector is deeply worrying. If it is impossible to address the issue under the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Bill, I urge the Executive to initiate discussions with a view to introducing parallel legislation for both the public and private sectors.

In our evolving society, enhanced categorisation&#8212;as detailed today&#8212;is welcome.</p><p>To the benefit of our society, Scotland has, through the years, become home to various ethnic groups. Imminent changes to immigration and asylum legislation mean that Scotland is likely to welcome more new residents&#8212;an estimated 6,000 before the census data are taken. According to current figures, the majority of those people will become bona fide residents. It is important that support agencies and public services have adequate information to service the needs of those residents.</p><p>The ability to communicate is a basic necessity. Consider the case of asylum seekers. They are not only socially excluded by the stigma of using vouchers for food until a decision is made on their cases, there is also the possibility that they will be unable to communicate if no translator can be supplied. Agencies have already expressed concerns about the difficulties of support services when translation services are limited, for example for speakers of Turkish Kurdish, Maghrebi Arabic and Pushtun.</p><p>The census should be forward looking. With rises in the general population, the role of language as an identifying factor is likely to increase over the next 10 years. Challenging social exclusion must involve uncovering issues that interested agencies do not yet fully understand. In terms of information gathering, why not use the most comprehensive survey&#8212;the census for 2001&#8212;as the baseline and then build upon the information given? Output from census information would inform a national strategy on interpreting and translating.</p><p>No effective equivalent is available from survey information, as any survey is, by definition, undertaken on the basis of a sample and therefore can provide only supplemental information. It cannot replace the value of the census. That applies also to any proposed household survey question on language spoken in the home, whatever size the sample. The census is one of the main ways of ensuring that fundamental human rights are protected, by ensuring that the rights of minorities are strengthened and that there is proper legal, social and cultural integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities.</p><p>I must mention the Scots language, which my colleagues have discussed already. Of course <place-holder colnum=\"1103\"/> Scots should be included as a defined language in the census. After all, as Irene McGugan said, Scots is recognised by the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages as one of Europe's minority languages, and it would be ridiculous if Scotland's own Parliament did not recognise it as such.</p><p>Surely Scotland would benefit from a national strategy on monitoring that addresses the historic lack of data on ethnic minority communities and that, at last, defines Scots as a significant language of Scotland.

Instead, I will use my time to focus on an element of sustainable development that has been mentioned only in passing, although it has a direct impact on all consumers in our society: housing.</p><p>My colleague, Kenny MacAskill, who has been much quoted this afternoon, is noted in the Transport and the Environment Committee for citing European examples to inform the debate. I will take that liberty this afternoon. The Scandinavian countries, which can be said to have climatic conditions comparable to those of Scotland, have sustainable approaches to housing development that are streets ahead of ours. Norway, Sweden and Denmark have strategies for energy efficiency, and sustainable approaches are taken in all parts of the community.</p><p>In Scandinavia, there is a general philosophy of sustainable development. Sadly, in our country, as Sylvia Jackson noted, there is as yet no such commonly held philosophy. That is why I particularly welcome the minister's inclusion of an education representative on her panel.</p><p>Housing and community building have suffered for too long from compromise between quality expectation and supply cost. We must move on from that. I was delighted when, two weeks ago at a meeting of the Transport and the Environment Committee, the minister gave a categorical assurance that the purpose of the next review of the building regulations this summer is to improve insulation standards and energy efficiency for residential properties in order to meet the climate requirements in Scotland, tackle fuel poverty problems and improve the level of environmental emissions. That is admirable and to be welcomed, and I have no reason to doubt the minister's sincerity.</p><p>However, if the Parliament is truly committed to sustainable development, we must look further than that and I suggest that the minister discuss with her colleagues more innovations. We could consider expanding and easing access to direct grant aid for improving the insulation standards of existing housing stock. We could be really innovative and provide take-up grants for the installation of solar water heaters and for the use of renewable energy technology. I make those suggestions in a spirit of co-operation. I am sure that no members will disagree with the basic principles.</p><p>However, now comes the rub: it will cost money. While it is true that taking a sustainable and ecological approach to housing need not lead to <place-holder colnum=\"809\"/> increased costs, it is also true that our choices are driven by cost. We select the cheapest materials and the smallest spaces. I speak from many years of experience in housing development in urban and rural locations.</p><p>It is likely that a commitment to sustainable development in housing will lead to increased individual unit costs. We have to take that on board. Allowances must be granted, to increase cost limits and grant funding for social housing, to cover the relatively small extra investment in housing stock. Not long ago, the Minister for Communities pledged that a number of homes would be built in Scotland in the next three years and promised that the extension of the right to buy would not result in a decrease in the number of social housing units. I ask the Minister for Transport and the Environment to fight to ensure that her sincere desire to implement sustainable development standards for our housing stock is not compromised by budget constraints and the need to ensure another department's credibility. Scotland's housing provision has suffered for too long from short-sightedness and&#8212;as the minister said&#8212;we must look at the future, not just the present.</p><p>It is not all doom and gloom, however.

She says that housing professionals are out of touch with their tenants, so their views are dismissed. She says that housing association committees are interested only in the survival of their organisations, so their views are dismissed. She says that the Council of Mortgage Lenders does not understand housing finance, so its views are dismissed. My working experience, however, tells me something different. On the issue of extending the right to buy, it is the minister who has got it wrong and whose views should be dismissed.</p><p>The minister uses as her excuse for that policy the adoption of a single social tenancy to equalise tenants' rights. Three parties in the chamber campaigned on such a policy. None of them included the right to purchase as a necessary part of such a tenancy, and certainly not at a discount.</p><p>Perhaps the Executive can expand on its commitment to the equalisation of rights. What about tenants in tied housing and tenants of private landlords? Do not they merit equal rights? What about the rights of those who aspire to be tenants of decent, affordable social housing? Were the homeless consulted about the extension of the right to buy? I think not.</p><p>The minister rejects the notion that the current right-to-buy arrangements have had an adverse effect on communities. We are told that only 2 per cent of the stock will be sold anyway and that the Executive will easily find the money to replace the lost stock. That is a thoroughly dishonest presentation of the situation, and it demonstrates how far the minister is from understanding Scotland's communities.</p><p>The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has demonstrated that the rate of sale of housing association properties can vary a hundredfold, depending on the stock's location. There will be further sales in areas already dominated by owner-occupation, leaving other areas with enforced concentrations of people with no option but to rent. That is moving Scotland further towards American-style welfare housing.</p><p>It appears that the minister has now been forced to recognise the special difficulties that face some rural areas. Properties are seldom sold on in the local housing market, but are, in some cases, kept or sold as holiday homes. I encourage the minister to pursue the issues further and to recognise that there are also urban areas in which there is a desperate need to retain housing for rent.</p><p>In the 1980s, the new towns competed aggressively in the house sales stakes. The result is that East Kilbride now exports homeless people to Glasgow because it has so little social rented accommodation to offer. Properties in East Kilbride, bought over the years under the right to <place-holder colnum=\"105\"/> buy, now form the basis of a growing private rented sector. The rents in that sector are too high for the local authority to use the houses for homeless people, because housing benefit levels are lower than the rents.</p><p>People are making money out of the right to buy, and the minister is encouraging that further.</p>", "hdate": "2000-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13218177", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is increasingly clear that the Executive has no coherent housing policy and is merely extending the Tories' policy further than even the Tories ever did or would have dared to do.

For example, Tricia Marwick referred to the plight of the elderly. A feu of &#163;60 a year may not sound much, but back-dated and with the current formula applied, the demand could cause acute financial difficulty and a prolonged period of indebtedness.</p><p>The Executive has conceded that it cannot realistically quantify such amounts. The problem is so complex that, with the best will in the world, no one can estimate the total. By common consent, the purpose of this reform is to abolish the duty scheme and to end an archaic system.

Every year, one in 20 adults is the victim of a personal crime. Everyone in the chamber has been affected by crime in some way. Perhaps some of us have even been direct victims.</p><p>I have never been the direct victim of a serious crime, but over the years I have suffered petty crime and, on occasion, the fear of potential crime. That felt bad. Although I have met and spoken to the victims of serious crimes, I cannot begin to imagine the trauma and stress that is experienced by people who are personally damaged or who lose a loved one through crime. As Victim Support Scotland tells us, the physical and emotional toll of crime on victims can be enormous. Its experience is that, above all, victims seek recognition of their suffering. Our present system denies victims that recognition. It also denies them the benefit of effective programmes to alleviate the effects of crimes.</p><p>In 1985, the general assembly of the United Nations adopted the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crimes and Abuse of Power. Although the UK Government signed up to that declaration a year later, we have a long way to go to ensure that Scots victims of crime have the same level of rights as people elsewhere, including people in other parts of the United Kingdom. It is true that, due to our criminal justice system, we may need to use different remedies, but the needs of victims are the same from Glasgow to Greenwich. With the right spirit, this Parliament can move ahead in this important area.</p><p>The minister's commitment today to support and strategy is not enough. Victims require and deserve defined rights. As Michael Matheson said, in England and Wales there is the victims charter; in Northern Ireland there is the code of practice for victims of crime. Those documents cover standards such as the provision of case progress information, witness support, and protection. The England and Wales charter sets out 27 standards of service that victims can expect from the criminal justice agencies. It explains which agency is responsible for providing which service and how victims can complain if they do not get the promised level of service. Current pilot projects include one to enable victims to make a statement to the authorities about the effects of the crime, and there is a witness support service in Crown and magistrates courts.</p><p>That all sounds like good practice that we should pursue here. Michael Matheson charged the Executive to introduce proposals for a victims <place-holder colnum=\"960\"/> charter. I believe that such an initiative would receive cross-party support, and we might even achieve consensus.

Rather, we will do it by carefully planning out the route. It is quite clear that the route will be defined by how we organise and exploit the mass of information that modern technology has the power to place at our fingertips.</p><p>That challenge will be met only if the people of Scotland have the basic skills and competencies, but we are told that approximately half of the men and women in the UK lack those basic skills. We can have no confidence that the position in Scotland is any better than that in the UK as a whole.</p><p>To date, much of the Executive's work appears to be focused not on core skills and competencies, but on the technology and physical access to it. Core skills and competencies are essential&#8212;fewer than 2,000 students in Scotland are studying mass communication. We need to increase student numbers in relevant fields and encourage adult returnees to further and higher education. The issue will be much debated following the outcome of the Cubie report.</p><p>The minister has urged us all to be excited about his latest initiative. I agree: CD-ROMs in Dundee are exciting and cybercaf&#233;s in Wester Hailes and Barrhead are impressive, but not if people lack the skills and confidence to use the technology. We must ensure that the technology is available to all of our people. The School Library Association, for example, has stated that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"for the whole population of Scotland digital literacy skills should be fostered by introductory and SVQ linked courses\"</p><p>and it suggests that staff in all libraries should be adequately trained in information and communication technology. That means focusing on people, not technology.</p><p>The technology will be relevant to people only if it is applied in situations that are relevant to them: at home, in the work place and in the community. Many people have no interest in information and communication technology; it is something for big business and bureaucracies. That perception will be reinforced by the make-up of the minister's task force.</p><p>The minister said that he considered inclusiveness to be a key aspect of the task force membership, but where are the community voices or the working teacher? Who will speak for those who work with special needs clients? If the minister wants the initiative to connect with the people of Scotland, and not simply work as a route <place-holder colnum=\"789\"/> into Government for special interests, he should look again at his task force recruitment, this time aiming at the consumer, not the technology provider.</p><p>Scotland has tremendous economic potential; everyone in this chamber recognises that. To realise that potential, Scotland needs to be an information society in terms of provision of knowledge and skills and of products and services. We already have a good base on which to build. I am pleased that my part of the country, East Kilbride, has a major stake in that base. Our technology park houses many small firms that have benefited from, and are assisting others to benefit from, European social fund and local authority initiatives. Gael Quality Software, last year's winner of Lanarkshire's best small business award, is an example of a success story. It has expanded from two founders to ownership of a factory that employs 40 people. That is a fine example of a co-ordination of training and enterprise that is surely the way forward.</p><p>I would like to inject a note of caution, though. East Kilbride also houses firms such as Motorola and JVC, both of which are well known for their success in technology. Unfortunately, both companies are suffering employee disputes. We know that there is employee unrest in some call centres. We must ensure that in our enthusiasm to welcome new technology industries, we do not allow a return to industrial revolution standards of employee rights.</p><p>While it is well meaning, the minister's plan shows a lack of strategy.

While we thought that we were gathering today to discuss the strategic roads review, as evidenced by today's contributors to the debate, the events of the past few days have clearly illustrated the wider problem of an absence of any real transport strategy for Scotland within which this review should have taken place. Selective further research may be welcome. I will return to that point.</p><p>I will not dwell on the plans outlined in the Minister for Transport and the Environment's statement. Kenny MacAskill and other colleagues have demonstrated the inadequacy of the programme to deal with Scotland's current and future transport needs. On behalf of the Executive, the minister has put a brave public face on a poor announcement. Clearly, Gordon Brown's determination to prioritise Labour's ever-growing war chest has condemned Scottish drivers to paying the highest fuel prices in Europe, while driving on a crumbling road network.</p><p>The Government's own figures show that almost a third of the current trunk road network has a residual life of less than 10 years. Like our public transport system, the country's roads require investment. Indeed, an effective public transport system requires effective roads.</p><p>The background to today's announcement is the white paper \"Travel Choices for Scotland.\" That paper promised an integrated transport policy to help make a more inclusive society, and a policy that is appropriate to support Scotland's economy. Recent weeks have demonstrated that the Executive does not have enough understanding of Scotland's transport needs to develop such a policy.</p><p>In 1997, the Scottish Office central research unit <place-holder colnum=\"391\"/> published a review of Scottish travel data sources. I would like to place the conclusion on record:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Transport policy in Scotland clearly requires a resource, which has the potential for sub-regional analysis in order to address differences between the more densely populated areas of the central belt and the more sparsely populated rural areas . . . At present, policy and surveys conducted in Scotland are not addressing the context within which the travel decision occurs. This is a serious flaw, given the desirability in current policy terms to understand the relationship between social, fiscal and transport aspects of the behaviour of individuals and households.\"</p><p>The white paper was premature and the Executive was not properly informed. I suspect that the minister, due to her respected experience in the field, has always been aware of that deficit of current, relevant information. I hope that she will take steps to properly inform the Executive and the Parliament by appropriate further research carried out timeously.</p><p>I have with me a sheaf of parliamentary questions that have not yet been answered&#8212;questions lodged up to five weeks ago, which request basic information to enable my party's own response to a transport bill. That basic information is noted in the aforementioned Scottish Office central research unit report as being required. It seems that we have not moved on since then. The information that we do have is revealing. The more cynical members among us may see the Executive's policy direction as merely following the latest Westminster diktat.</p><p>I hope that the minister has won her battle and that the announced further research will be appropriate. We can then return to discussing Scottish answers to Scottish questions. While London may be in gridlock, Scotland clearly is not. According to the Executive's own figures, between 1985 and 1997, the average number of commuting and business trips made by Scots dropped from 207 to 203. The length of time taken for Scots to commute to their main place of work barely altered, increasing from 22 minutes to 23 minutes.</p><p>The Scottish Executive, with some assistance from other parties, has tried to present the transport debate as a simple choice between its politically correct anti-car policies and the views of the rest of us, who, it alleges, are hell-bent on wrecking the environment. I reject such a simplistic approach and will continue to press the minister to address the wider impact of her policies. For example, we need to understand why progress in reducing injuries and fatalities from road traffic accidents is now being reversed.</p><p>The roads programme should be only part of a wider transport policy. I urge the minister to accept that a holistic approach is best for what we are all trying to achieve. Sensible road infrastructure, through improvement or new commitment, has a place in the overall objective of ensuring effective <place-holder colnum=\"392\"/> public transport and addressing environmental and safety issues, both nationally and locally.</p>", "hdate": "1999-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13214033", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Open Question Time &#8212; scottish executive: Joint Working"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Of all the debates in the chamber to date, few can have been as highly anticipated.

However, I have never worked for a charitable organisation and I would like to point out to the Conservative party that voluntary organisations and charities are not necessarily the same thing.</p><p>In the past 17 years, I have seen at first hand the impact of Government decisions on voluntary organisations. Many of those decisions have served to reduce the independence of the sector. Like others, I welcome the publication of \"The Scottish Compact\" as the beginning of the process of re-establishing the independence of the voluntary sector. It is very important that the compact recognises the right of the voluntary sector to comment on and challenge Government policy.</p><p>There has been a danger recently that the voluntary sector might go down the same road as local government and end up acting primarily as a vehicle for the delivery of Government policy. However, one of the strengths of the voluntary sector is that it provides an opportunity for many different approaches. It can accommodate organisations as diverse as Crew 2000 and Calton Athletic. Long may it continue to do so.</p><p>I am especially familiar with the voluntary housing movement, within which there is a comparable diversity. Housing associations and housing co-operatives range from large national associations that are dominated by establishment figures to local community organisations that are dominated by tenants. Each model has its place and it is important that, in our desire to achieve the objectives of Parliament or the Executive, we do not damage that diversity.</p><p>Make no mistake, however: even within the voluntary sector, the diversity of approaches creates tensions. At its best, it is a creative tension. Experience of work in the voluntary sector breeds respect for the contribution that even a small group of dedicated volunteers can achieve. If politicians try to colonise the sector, it will be at their peril. Effective partnership is much more <place-holder colnum=\"225\"/> productive than command and control.</p><p>The compact is strong on partnership, which is to be welcomed. However, the reality is a long way from the rhetoric. In the distribution of resources, for example, too many initiatives are being launched, many of them based on wasteful competitive bidding. I am sure that many voluntary workers would echo that sentiment, none more so than those in the voluntary housing movement. The Executive should, in distributing resources, guard against practising a form of divide and conquer.</p><p>The recently reported fiasco of the 21<sup>st </sup>century halls programme is a case in point. In the third round of the initiative, 93 projects were submitted for consideration and only 16 awards were made. Under that programme, approximately &#163;300,000 to &#163;400,000 of speculative expenditure has been made by the voluntary sector, and much effort has been wasted.</p><p>Similarly, the new housing partnership programme saw housing associations waste substantial resources bidding for projects, only to see the money ring-fenced for local authority debt write-off. Before I am lambasted from across the chamber, I will make it clear that I am not criticising the decision to write off local authority debt. Indeed, it was my party's policy long before many others were able to understand the concept.</p><p>If housing associations and housing co-operatives had known how few resources were to be made available to support the work that they do very successfully, many of them would have avoided wasteful expenditure and effort.</p><p>It is the SNP's policy that there should be much more openness and transparency in the distribution of public resources. That applies to funding for the Arts Council and sportscotland and to the distribution of lottery funds as much as to the distribution of resources in the Scottish block.</p><p>We believe that that is one of the aspirations of the Scottish Parliament. The practice of using agencies such as Scottish Homes, the Scottish Arts Council and sportscotland to distribute resources can be valuable, and it should be kept under review.</p><p>To make the compact effective, the Executive must move on to implementation as quickly as possible. All departments and non-departmental public bodies must produce their plans for implementation. Those plans should be the focus for wide consultation in the voluntary sector. As noted by my colleague, Lloyd Quinan, we must not fragment the sector by creating a two-tier voluntary sector&#8212;those who have signed up to the Executive's initiative and those who have not. The SNP's amendment would go some way to ensuring that that does not happen, and I urge <place-holder colnum=\"226\"/> members to support it.</p><p>Volunteering is at the heart of civic society in Scotland, and the Parliament must value and respect the contribution of those who give their time freely for the benefit of others.

Maybe we need more Scottish history taught, not just in schools, as some members propose, but to the minister and his colleagues. Perhaps Murray Tosh could help to set that up for us.</p><p>The minister's script could have been lifted from the Tory archives. This is a rerun of what happened in March 1986 when Malcolm Rifkind, then Secretary of State for Scotland, was desperately looking for a way to end the teachers' dispute. He announced an independent inquiry and the Main committee was set up. It took seven years for the Tories to get into that mess, yet here we are in the same position in the first term of the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Unlike my colleague Nicola Sturgeon, I was not at school during the last series of teachers' strikes, but I do remember them and the damage that they did to our young people, then and since. There was two years and six months of disruption&#8212;work to rule, missed lessons and no extra-curricular activities. Lloyd Quinan has mentioned the damage to sport. The problem was, then as now, that teachers' pay had been seriously eroded, with those in power unwilling to make a straightforward settlement, and there was a decent pay rise only for the lucky ones. No promoted posts this time, though, but their removal so that savings can be used to fund the present offer. Now, as then, there is a strong case for a pay rise for teachers and there is also a genuine need for reform. Those two issues need not be too closely linked, unless the minister intends to use pay as a means to blackmail the teaching profession over conditions.</p><p>On reform, why is there constant harping on about teachers having to be willing to change? As others have said today, teachers have for many years been receptive to change. The minister tells teachers that they must put children first. How patronising. He overlooks the fact that the vast majority of teachers put children first every time that they teach a lesson.</p><p>When the millennium review was reported, the EIS general secretary said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I believe strongly that the outcome is a very positive one for schools and teachers and offers now the opportunity for <place-holder colnum=\"916\"/> substantial improvement in the delivery of education and for improved salaries for teachers.\"</p><p>No, teachers are not opposed to change; teachers are opposed to erosion of their pay and conditions and the imposition of ill-considered change.</p><p>For reasons known only to himself the minister is being hostile to the teachers, as he never was to his own professional counterparts when he was health minister. Already his approach is bearing fruit. He has achieved more than Mrs Liddell did during her short time as teacher and nat-basher general. Even she did not manage to turn a confirmed 98 per cent of the teaching profession against her.</p><p>I echo Nicola Sturgeon's call for honesty in this debate. Labour is spending proportionately less on education than the Tories. That is confirmed by a letter from the House of Commons library, dated 21 September. It states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"although spending on education is planned to increase as a proportion of GDP during the Comprehensive Spending Review period, it will not return to the levels recorded in the early 1990s\".</p><p>The minister should stop pretending that the teachers have caused this problem. The dispute could have been settled by negotiation, with the minister playing a constructive role. Instead, he chose to sit on the sidelines issuing threats&#8212;having, I suspect, already decided to abolish the SJNC and to bring the teachers to heel. Again, we are reminded that in education, as in many other areas, new Labour is taking forward the old Conservative agenda. The minister is treading a well-worn path&#8212;a path that has seen this country slide even further down the international education league tables.</p><p>Teachers are not shirkers who demand more pay for less work. Most are committed professionals, who strive to educate their charges in the face of immense social and economic challenges. The teaching profession and the education system are indivisible. We cannot attack one without hurting the other. The minister, like his predecessors, is severely damaging our education system by his incessant and unjustified attacks on those who deliver the service. That is to the potential detriment of those about whom we should care most&#8212;our children and young people.
