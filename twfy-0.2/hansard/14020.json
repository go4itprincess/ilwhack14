I will therefore avoid some of the critical issues that have been mentioned previously.</p><p>Nevertheless, I take the opportunity to welcome the debate. Although the issue of new psychoactive substances has been subject to question and previous discussion in Parliament, the fact that this is the first Government debate on the subject indicates the importance that the Government attaches to the issue and its determination to deal with the problems that it has raised. I will therefore happily vote for the motion tonight and, of course, for the Labour Party amendment.</p><p>The fact that we are dealing with this problem should not be taken in isolation. We have had similar problems in the past when a craze for a substance has led to significant health problems, particularly among young people. Many members will be aware of the problems that existed because of the inhalation of solvents some time ago. That did eventually pass, and we all welcome that it did.</p><p>Many of the problems that we are addressing today were addressed in some form at that time. I was delighted to hear from the minister that Police Scotland is looking at the possibility of working with trading standards to ensure that the use of these substances is not unfettered and that planning and licensing laws are being considered as options.</p><p>I was aware that there was a problem with new psychoactive substances, but its extent was brought home to me surprisingly quickly during the Christmas recess. I was contacted by a number of people in the Arbroath area who had experienced quite acute problems as a result of the sale of these substances.</p><p>In Arbroath, the issue of so-called legal highs remains a grave concern to parents and other residents, because these substances are not sold furtively, as one might expect, but openly from ordinary retail premises. That gives them a facade of acceptability and safety, which they do not have and which, in the opinion of many, they should never have had.</p><p>Before the Arbroath against legal highs group was formally founded, I met Arbroath residents and a number of Angus councillors in December, who wished to express their frustration that these products, which were being sold as plant food, research chemicals or, in one case, as incense, were so freely available, without any kind of licensing and that, consequently, the local authority had very little ability to challenge their sale.</p><p>The meeting that I attended was a catalyst for forming the group. Its Facebook page attracted hundreds of people within hours of it being set up. The current membership stands at more than 1,800. Substantial interest has been expressed through that route.</p><p>The Arbroath campaign has had considerable coverage in the local media. That reflects local concerns, which are exacerbated by the fact that one of the shops selling the substances opened just two doors down from a support centre that helps people with addiction issues. Another has opened directly across the road from the award-winning community alcohol free environment&#8212;CAFE&#8212;project, which works with vulnerable and marginalised young people.</p><p>It is clear to me that everything that can be done to address the issue of the sale of these products must be done. I know that the concerns are not limited to Arbroath; others around Scotland and further afield are rightly protesting at the easy availability of these substances, which can do so much harm to those who take them under the misunderstanding that they are somehow legal.</p><p>The reason why the term &#8220;legal high&#8221; is so dangerous is that if the substances are described as &#8220;legal highs&#8221; there can be a misunderstanding that they are somehow acceptable or safe. In fact, the problem is that they have not been tested or regulated and we do not know whether they are safe. As a result, some young people in particular take the substances believing that there is some kind of protection associated with the term &#8220;legal high&#8221; when, in fact, exactly the reverse is the case.</p><p>The work of the campaign in Arbroath goes on, and I commend whole-heartedly those who are involved for how they have conducted themselves, often in the face of overt hostility from those in some quarters who wish to see the trade continue. The situation must not be allowed to continue. I urge both Governments, north and south of the border, and all relevant organisations to work together to find a solution to a problem that continues to exercise those who genuinely care for their communities.</p><p>In dealing with this problem, we will have to cast the net wide. We have already heard at some length from the minister how she intends to deal with the problem when the opportunity arises. In this age of the internet, it is increasingly dangerous to control these substances. As a consequence, I believe that it is necessary for us to work hard to educate young people in particular that it is not acceptable to use such substances of any kind simply for recreational purposes.</p><p>The use of drugs in our society has caused many problems over the years. Some of our biggest problems are associated with drugs that have already been mentioned. I believe that that problem is gradually beginning to become less serious, not least because of the work that has been done by successive Governments to overcome it. It would be such a disappointment if, at the time of a potential victory, we found ourselves facing another wave of substance abuse. That is why we must stamp on this hard now.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22884031", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Psychoactive Substances"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although I can claim to have a higher in chemistry, I cannot claim to have the depth of knowledge of Elaine Murray or even Nigel Don, who intervened on her.

It is, for many of us, an easy thing to get on an aircraft, fly to the other end and get off without thinking about it. However, the difficulties that are faced by those who are physically disabled are often brought home to able-bodied passengers when we have to observe the difficulties that disabled passengers have to put up with on flights&#8212;sometimes to our embarrassment. Sometimes we are able to help, but most of the time it makes us realise how difficult it is to travel&#8212;even on modern aircraft&#8212;for someone who is disabled and in a wheelchair.</p><p>For that reason, it is very encouraging to hear that many airlines are extremely successful in dealing with the problem. Ryanair was included in the list of airlines that have on-board aisle chairs. Dare I be the one who makes the joke that suggests that Ryanair will stop at nothing to get an extra seat on an aircraft? However, in this case it is an example of a low-cost airline that can achieve the objectives within the low-cost business model.</p><p>A trend that has occurred in aviation in recent years is that low-cost airlines have been the most successful. We want low-cost airlines to be able to keep their costs down, but, as Neil Findlay has pointed out, he is not asking for expensive conversions or expensive changes to the aircraft. He is simply asking for the provision of basic equipment that allows the job to be done on the aircraft itself, along with appropriate staff training so that they can use that basic equipment for the purpose required on the aircraft.</p><p>I also agree with Jackie Baillie&#8217;s point about people being lifted properly, which also relates to training. The ability to lift properly is taught in our hospitals and through many other organisations in Scotland. Surely it is not beyond the realms of possibility that airline cabin staff can be taught basic lifting techniques, even if for no other reason than to protect themselves from the potential injury that may be achieved by doing it wrong.</p><p>We are in a situation in which we have a problem in front of us. We have guidelines in place but those guidelines are not being observed. The suggestion has been made that those guidelines should be incorporated into legislation. I may ultimately find myself supporting that proposal, but in the first instance it would surely be easier to ensure that the guidelines are properly observed. The work that ABTA has already done to encourage travel agents to do proper checks and proper inquiries into the availability of equipment and trained staff is a start.</p><p>It is also vitally important that we ensure that travel agents do all that they can to give accurate information. There is nothing more annoying than situations such as the one that Neil Findlay described: when someone checks in advance that the equipment and service is available and then, when they are on the plane, they discover that in fact that is not the case. Inaccuracy of information is one of the largest parts of the problem. People can always book with an airline in the belief that it will provide the service, but if it does not, that is the most difficult situation in which they can find themselves.</p><p>I am glad that Neil Findlay has been able to bring the issue to Parliament. He has identified a problem and he has identified a solution, which is inexpensive and can be effectively introduced quickly, without damaging the business model of our most successful low-cost airlines. I therefore think that this is a perfect opportunity for everyone in a position of authority on this matter to get their heads together and get something done at short notice, to ensure that no passenger who boards an aircraft in Scotland, the UK or across Europe has to suffer such indignity.

Although I say that in a fairly light-hearted way, there is a serious issue here. However, we must not allow that to get in the way of the unanimity that exists in the chamber. It is with that in mind that I rise to support the minister&#8217;s motion.</p><p>As other members are, I am delighted to welcome the management team of Scottish Veterans Residences to Parliament today&#8212;they are in the public gallery. Scottish Veterans Residences is one of several veterans housing charities that operate in Scotland. It offers veterans a range of housing options and is currently driving forward an innovative and much-needed development in Glasgow.</p><p>As members may be aware, I have an army veteran in my office, so I have had no alternative but to keep a keen interest in veterans issues over a number of years now. In 2012, I was delighted to sponsor a reception on the issue, which the minister kindly attended along with many other MSPs.</p><p>For most service personnel, the move from military to civilian life is a smooth one, although many veterans have told me that it can be more of a culture shock than they envisaged. For some, however, their military service or even underlying health issues that were previously undetected will mean that they face greater challenges in adjusting to their situation. Although veterans housing charities often specialise in different needs, the fact that they operate under one umbrella and have a single application process demonstrates partnership working and a desire to deliver effective services to those who need them.</p><p>To secure a home is a fundamental need for anyone, but veterans often require more than that. It is estimated that more than 70,000 members of the British armed forces have served in Afghanistan since 2001 and more than 100,000 served in Iraq between 2003 and 2009, so I am sure that we all agree that specialist services for veterans will become increasingly important. Poppyscotland found that, compared with their English and Welsh counterparts, veterans who live in Scotland are 10 per cent more likely to become homeless, 8 per cent more likely to suffer from mental health problems, 5 per cent more likely to have financial problems, 5 per cent more likely to have a criminal record and 3 per cent more likely to suffer from alcohol problems.</p><p>One person in five in the Scottish population is a member of the veterans community through being an ex-services person or being the spouse or dependant of such a person. Research shows that some 350,000 members of the veterans community have potential welfare needs, and I feel that it is important to highlight that.</p><p>Yes, the support that is given to serving personnel who are making the transition from military to civilian life has improved considerably over the years, but too often a need for specialist support manifests itself only years after discharge. That is why I am glad to see the growing recognition that our veterans may need our help well beyond the initial phase of their civilian life.</p><p>The issues that have been raised in the debate are important and varied. However, the minister&#8217;s proposal for a veterans commissioner draws considerable interest and I wish to address it directly. In his opening remarks, the minister made it clear&#8212;I quite agree with the principle that he set out&#8212;that in the past many veterans believed that they were properly represented because there were so many veterans in our elected parliaments and other bodies. That is no longer the case.</p><p>However, my concern over the appointment of a commissioner&#8212;not my opposition, members will understand&#8212;is that we have been too quick to appoint commissioners in the past. We are in a particularly lucky position in having here in our Parliament a minister who has been appointed to represent veterans&#8217; interests who is a man who has done considerable military service. The concept of a commissioner has worked many times for other purposes, but the cluttered environment of commissioners and ombudsmen has required thinning in recent years, so the appointment of another commissioner, if it is to be done, must be done with key objectives in mind.</p><p>There is already an extremely complex&#8212;some would say cluttered&#8212;landscape for veterans in Scotland. The ability to bring together specialist support is already achieved by that complex landscape of charities and veterans representatives, including veterans champions, across all our communities. For that reason, I am somewhat concerned about the appointment of a commissioner, and I am also concerned about how it may be funded. I would like the minister to explain the funding arrangements. If it is to be funded by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, we must consider whether that money could be better spent on other priorities.</p><p>The Government has to justify its call for a commissioner to deal with veterans&#8217; issues. The minister must explain to us exactly what a commissioner would achieve that is not being achieved by those who already work extremely hard in the sector, and exactly what we can expect to see over the longer term. If, as has been the case with some in the past, the appointment will gradually be subsumed into another responsibility and watered down, it may actually make things more complicated rather than more simple.</p><p>With my qualified support, I look forward to hearing more answers from the minister and to having in place a system that will deliver, whether we have a commissioner or not.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838931", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by thanking the BBC for advance sight of the minister&#8217;s statement.

The key elements that have been placed before us today for discussion are the proposal for improved childcare provision and&#8212;in the past few hours&#8212;the issue of free school meals for children in P1 to P3. Those are the kinds of measures that the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition Government in the south has introduced specifically to begin to reverse that cycle of dependency. Quite wisely, they have been copied by the Government here in Scotland and they will benefit us significantly. Children will be in the front line of reversing that cycle of dependency and we need to be in a position to provide that support.</p><p>Yet, sadly, the Scottish Government has consistently exposed itself as believing that the more money it puts towards those areas and individuals that are in the greatest poverty, the greater the success that it can reap. Concern about what that policy actually achieves seems to be the furthest thing from its mind. The Government has refused to understand the need for welfare reform. Among the other political parties&#8212;perhaps not in Scotland, but certainly in other parts of the United Kingdom&#8212;Labour understands the need for welfare reform and the actions in government of the coalition parties indicate that they understand the need for welfare reform. Here in Scotland, once upon a time, even the SNP appeared to understand the need for welfare reform. However, in 2014&#8212;the year in which we will have the referendum on Scottish independence&#8212;the SNP suddenly no longer believes in welfare reform.

I see Scotland today as a country that, in some of its regions, has a chronic labour shortage, and the movement of labour around Europe, particularly within the European Union, is a boon to many businesses in parts of Scotland that simply would not exist if they could not employ eastern European labour. Similarly, I believe that this country has a proud record of providing asylum for those who require it.</p><p>The Labour Party has questions to answer about its treatment of refugees when it was in government. It had a tendency to accept asylum seekers into the country, give them homes, give their children school places and then take years to decide that they were not entitled to asylum in this country. That resulted in people who had been here for many years being deported at short notice, which was, in itself, cruel and unusual treatment. The previous Labour Government did not have an unblemished record.</p><p>What we see today from Jackie Baillie is, as other members have said, an attempt to confuse and conflate a number of issues. We should be prepared to address the issue of illegal immigration in a sensible and fair way. It is reasonable that any country should have rules governing who can and cannot enter as an economic migrant, and those who seek to bypass the system with bogus asylum claims or by simply bypassing the entry points to the country altogether should feel the full force of the law. It is important that those who are not entitled to be here and cannot justify their presence are given the opportunity to return to the country from which they came.</p><p>I am concerned about the motion&#8217;s reference to the behaviour of the National Front back in the 1970s. I am just about old enough to remember how the National Front behaved in the early 1970s and I would not wish to compare anyone with it, although I understand that certain words on the posters may give the opportunity for such comparisons to be made. However, if we look at the Labour Party&#8217;s actions in opposition south of the border, we see it reacting to the proposals to change the rules in advance of 1 January with nothing other than procrastination. What is driving that other than fear of the advance of the UK Independence Party south of the border?</p><p>I believe that we need a much clearer view of what constitutes a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant.

The result is that many people are forced into the hands of payday lenders. I believe that that is also a function of the marketplace in which we find ourselves, which it is not beyond the powers of politicians to influence.</p><p>Going back to John Wilson&#8217;s speech, I note that in the United States of America up to a third of the population has an account with a credit union not because of any particular demand but because the credit union sector has developed more quickly and effectively in that part of the world. The result is that people who in this country might rely on banks, credit cards or, in the worst possible cases, payday lenders have an alternative.</p><p>If we look at the development of financial institutions over hundreds of years, we will find that some of what at their formation were the smallest and most insignificant organisations have become some of the largest banks in the world. Unfortunately, perhaps, our building society sector, which at one time played such a key role, was largely absorbed by the banks, which then misused their position and found themselves having to be bailed out with public funds. The credit union sector has tremendous potential in two respects. First, it has the capacity to develop its market and find ways of providing loans at a competitively economic rate to people who need them and have no alternative. Secondly&#8212;and more important&#8212;it has an opportunity to influence and educate those who cannot find credit elsewhere because of their borrowing record. Bringing people into the fold, giving them the necessary education to be more financially responsible and letting them go forward and take advantage of their better credit rating to participate in the broader market is a bonus that many credit unions could, in the long term, afford to give.</p><p>I, too, congratulate the Scottish Government on its 12 days of debtmas document, which I downloaded from the internet.

In doing so, I take the opportunity to welcome representatives of the project who are watching proceedings from the public gallery.</p><p>The Arbroath CAFE project offers a comprehensive range of activities, opportunities and advice services for young people and those with a disability. In fact, it is the only large-scale activity-based drop-in facility of its kind in Angus.</p><p>Time does not permit me to discuss in depth the full range of services that the project offers, nor the many plaudits that it has won over the years, but the highlights include drop-in sessions that run four nights a week and offer games and cooking, art and crafts, keep-fit and guitar lessons. All those sessions are run with an emphasis on developing skills, boosting confidence and self-esteem, developing literacy and numeracy skills, and promoting good sportsmanship and a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>The project also provides parent and toddler sessions; a darts academy in which people are coached by the Scottish international player Alan Soutar; a chess club; an interschool five-a-side competition; a get set, get fit programme for 12 to 15-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds; and speed, agility and quickness sessions that provide tailor-made programmes for those with a disability. Those sessions are designed to improve motor skill development.</p><p>One of the activities that has gained substantial coverage over the years is street football, which involves a portable pitch that can be set up almost anywhere and allows young people to form teams and have a game of football under appropriate supervision. Some members might recall the street football visit to the Scottish Parliament a few years ago. Members were able to have a go themselves and play football with very enthusiastic and extremely energetic and skilful young footballers.</p><p>The project&#8217;s street football team came third in an extremely tough competition in the inaugural street football world cup in Germany in 2006. It also won the fair play award in that tournament. That speaks volumes about the many added benefits that young people receive when they take part in the CAFE project.</p><p>Many of the activities take place in the project&#8217;s own premises, but other venues include sports centres, local parks, woods, beaches, the golf course, theatres and cinemas.</p><p>Like all excellent community organisations, the CAFE project does not work in isolation. Its holistic approach means that it engages with health visitors, criminal justice teams, the national health service, the police and fire services, the job centre and local charities, to name but a few.</p><p>All the activities combine to offer a comprehensive service to young people that provides them with an alternative to hanging about on street corners and getting into trouble. There is a safe, alcohol-free environment that is highly valued by those who use it and the partner organisations, which also seek to help vulnerable youngsters, some of whom come from areas that appear in the index of multiple deprivation. Some might come from a domestic setting in which alcohol, drug and domestic abuse can be a recurring feature of life.</p><p>On average, around 650 people are helped by the CAFE project each year. They are not just helped; they play a pivotal role in how the project is run. They are consulted on activities, games, equipment and the standards of behaviour that are expected. The groups can also decide on the content of their 10-week programmes. Equally important is the fact that they help to ensure that the programmes are delivered on time and on budget. Crucially, they, too, are encouraged to volunteer their services to help the project through working behind the CAFE bar or supervising youngsters or younger members.</p><p>All of those things have made a hugely positive contribution to the lives of those who have participated and, consequently, local communities have also benefited. Norrie Stein, the founder of the CAFE project, tells me that it has made a significant impact on youth offending in the area. Who would know better than him, given his role for many years as a local sheriff?</p><p>We know that young people taking advantage of the programmes and the advice and help available at the CAFE project are empowered to turn their backs on life choices that will negatively impact on their own opportunities. Such is the success of the CAFE project that it is now a much-studied model that has been replicated throughout the United Kingdom. It has become hugely important in Arbroath and Angus and a much-loved resource valued by all who are kept up to date with its activities through the local press.</p><p>As with many charitable organisations, funding the project is becoming more challenging. The community has rallied round and has been extremely generous, ensuring that the good work will continue until at least next year. The CAFE project itself has responded well, rationalising its business plan and cutting costs wherever possible. The fact is that the CAFE project, although a small charitable organisation in comparison with some others, punches well above its weight in terms of activity and outcomes. We need to see that good work continue.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the other contributions to this debate.

That new and interesting approach is welcome. For too long, discussion on human rights has centred on processes rather than outcomes.</p><p>However, we should not misrepresent the action plan. It includes consideration of services and calls for a human rights-based approach to delivery of services. That does not mean that everyone has an unlimited right to whatever public service they desire. For example, the UN human rights convention includes a right to paid holidays. It is hard to believe that the right to a paid holiday is an absolute and inalienable moral right, just as it is difficult to see that the right to respite care is a moral right. That does not mean that those rights and aspirations are not worthy or important, but we must recognise that they exist because of political pressure rather than because of some moral absolute.</p><p>As for housing and welfare, all parties agree that there is a need to increase the availability of affordable housing and to improve the quality of ageing social housing stock. Everyone has a right to be adequately housed, but that does not mean that everyone has the right to any type of housing that they wish. We live in a world of finite resources, so we must reconcile the rights of a family who are housed in overcrowded accommodation with the rights of an individual who lives in social housing that he or she is underoccupying. In that case, a human rights-based approach must surely favour the family who live in temporary or vastly overcrowded circumstances.</p><p>Equally, a human rights-based approach does not preclude welfare reform.

It is, for example, legitimate to ask how we reconcile the absolute rights of a victim with those of an assailant, and the fact is that we need to work very hard on human rights to ensure that we achieve some equality and justice.</p><p>However, the usual prejudiced view that the Conservative Party does not support human rights has been aired in this debate. In fact, that could not be further from the truth. I am pleased to tell the chamber that in the new year the Conservatives will publish a document setting out exactly how they will replace the Human Rights Act 1998, which was introduced by Labour, and later in the year the party will publish a draft bill containing the legal detail of exactly how those changes will take effect. Therefore, it is not correct to say that the Conservatives want to scrap the 1998 act; instead, my party&#8212;correctly, in my view&#8212;is looking at reforming legislation to focus human rights on those who deserve and require protection. Indeed, members who have spoken in the debate have dealt at some length with the areas in which protection is required.</p><p>Jenny Marra has thrown some elements of the Parliament into confusion with her amendment, which, although out of place in the broader context, addresses a key subject that, I believe, the Equal Opportunities Committee will examine again as part of its current work programme.

However, as members have pointed out, a similar priority could be given to a whole list of other areas including human trafficking, domestic abuse and the series of mental health issues that Alison McInnes highlighted in her speech.</p><p>I as a Conservative and my Conservative group in the Parliament give our full commitment to furthering the aims and objectives of human rights legislation as implemented in Scotland.

I hope that we continue to do that in the way in which this debate is conducted.</p><p>I recognise a number of issues from participation in earlier such debates. We have been talking about the minister&#8217;s strong belief in regional management for a long time. I am sure that he well remembers&#8212;I certainly do&#8212;that, more than a dozen years ago, as the convener of the Parliament&#8217;s Rural Affairs Committee at the time, I attended the publication in Brussels of the European green paper that originally proposed regional management committees. Of course, in the end, we got regional advisory committees.</p><p>Often, the opportunity for regional management is held up as a tempting and tantalising promise for the future. I hope that, on this occasion, the minister manages to succeed in achieving it.</p><p>A series of issues must be addressed in this round of negotiations. The minister has gone through them in significant detail, but the most profound objective is the move towards a discard ban. The plans are in place and they must be achieved.</p><p>Our fishermen should be commended for the work that they have done over many years in ensuring a reduction in wasted effort&#8212;they took more than their fair share in ensuring that&#8212;and in the number of discards, by applying technology to ensure that smaller fish were not caught at all. Through that sustainability, we have seen significant improvements in the level of stocks in the North Sea. I am particularly taken by the fact that cod numbers are on the rise once again because, in the time that this Parliament has existed, there has been considerable effort to ensure that cod recovery took place.</p><p>While this negotiation goes forward, it is important to note that there have been a number of delays. The fact that the talks with Norway will continue into the new year is not a unique situation but one that will delay the delivery of proper outcomes.</p><p>On that subject, a couple of issues have been raised with me in order that I might discuss them with the cabinet secretary. We heard extensively from Claire Baker about the problems facing the pelagic fishery and in particular about the mackerel stock in the North Atlantic. I ask the cabinet secretary to give an assurance that any future deal on mackerel, first of all will involve Norway&#8212;because, in my view, without Norway&#8217;s involvement we will not have a deal&#8212;and, secondly, will not result in Iceland in any way gaining access to EU waters. If we are to continue as part of a common fisheries policy, it is important that we have control over resources locally wherever possible. Any extension of access to EU waters, particularly our waters, would have the opposite effect.</p><p>A number of issues are crucial to the success of these negotiations but many of them are simply part of the process of progressing from where we were the year before. As the cabinet secretary said, last year was a good year: we saw limited reductions in quota and stability for our fishermen.</p><p>However, as we saw with the scare over falling nephrops numbers, things can change from one season to the next. It is important that we get a future for our fishing industry that will deliver confidence, continuity and sustainability in the long term. As I said at the start, it is for that reason that I believe that the cabinet secretary has set out the appropriate way forward in European negotiations. I hope that he, along with his UK counterparts, will be able to go to Brussels and ensure that Scotland&#8217;s two Governments, working hand in hand, deliver for Scotland&#8217;s fishing communities.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-08450.2, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;, and urges the Scottish Government to continue to work closely with the UK Government and the fishing community to secure the future viability of Scotland&#8217;s fishing industry&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22798465", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries Negotiations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I enjoy the annual opportunity to participate in this debate, with its traditional role of sending the minister off to the European fisheries negotiation with the full weight of parliamentary support behind him.

Another piece of magic was its decision to count completions as well as starts, which meant that, when taken over the whole period, one could draw in houses that were started before the period in question began. Even better, if the approach was changed mid-period, one could actually count houses started in one year and finished in the next&#8212;in other words, they could be counted twice over. The Government&#8217;s figures in that respect have to be studied very closely.</p><p>There is also an in-built contempt for housing associations. The Government will deny it but, when it talks about councils to the exclusion of housing associations&#8217; achievements, it undermines the contribution of those organisations. I have never ceased to be amazed at the way in which, reminiscent of an old Hammer horror film, housing associations have batted their eyelashes and swooned as the Government, like a vampire, sucks the very life-blood from them.</p><p>As for this Government&#8217;s actions and their results, yesterday&#8217;s housing statistics really are a damning indictment of the Government&#8217;s failure to address Scotland&#8217;s housing shortage. Under its stewardship, the supply of new homes has fallen by almost half. Perhaps we should not be surprised at that, given the Scottish Government&#8217;s choice to disproportionately slash the housing budget. Periodically, it unveils additions to the housing pot that are quite often funded by Barnett consequentials from that evil Tory Government south of the border. I am sorry&#8212;I should perhaps have put that phrase in quotation marks.</p><p>I believe that that is fiscal fancy footwork and that it is having a hugely detrimental effect on Scottish house-building levels. The uncertainty is, in my view, hampering progress and we need only look at the Scottish Government&#8217;s spending choices to see why. Its response is not to become more ambitious; instead, it resorts to the well-worn tactic of pointing the finger at global downturns and, of course, Westminster. It is the political equivalent of saying, &#8220;A big boy did it and ran away&#8221;, which is one of the three key defences that the Scottish Government regularly uses.</p><p>The long-awaited white paper on independence tells us many things. We will keep our phone numbers, we will still have mobile internet access and we will still be able to watch &#8220;Dr Who&#8221;. However, it does not tell us anything meaningful about how the SNP would build enough homes to house those who need them. We can all take comfort from the fact that an independent Scotland will still be called Scotland&#8212;I believe that that is in the white paper. However, we should not be surprised. Housing is a devolved issue, and given the SNP Government&#8217;s lamentable performance on housing with the powers that it already has, those who are languishing on the housing waiting list cannot expect a reversal in fortunes whatever the outcome of the referendum.</p><p>The SNP told us that it would seek to leverage in private investment to build social housing. That is a laudable aim, but where is the money and where are the houses? The best that the Government has come up with so far is the national housing trust, which is now limping along in its third incarnation. Yes, with the NHT we are seeing houses built, but let us look a little more closely. Once a tenant has moved into an NHT property, the clock is ticking. They have their home for as little as five years, and if they cannot afford to buy it after that time they are left with little option but to move out. Let us compare and contrast that with Conservative housing policy. The right to buy offered tenants the option of either continuing to rent their home or buying it if they chose to do so.</p><p>In key areas of policy, delivery by the SNP Government is unacceptable compared with that by previous Governments.

To tell you the truth, if that is the way he seeks to make friends, I wouldnae like to be one of his enemies.</p><p>However, Keith Brown went on to talk about other things. His amendment mentions Trident. The truth is that he tells us that these contracts could be won after Scotland became independent yet any such negotiation would take place at exactly the same time as his Government was trying to close down the Faslane naval base. If that is how he makes friends, I do not know what he intends to achieve through his negotiations. Give and take is how we negotiate traditionally. I suspect that he would not be willing to negotiate on that or many other points.</p><p>Many times during the debate, red herrings have been raised.

The most common answer is that they got involved in politics because they wanted to change the world. My most usual answer is that I got involved in politics because I thought that the world was changing too fast and I wanted to slow it down a bit. Perhaps that is the definition of conservative with a small c.</p><p>When I look at the proposals contained in the bill I see some specific issues that I hope to have time to address later, but I also see a general principle, which is to change the way in which we view marriage and to extend that to a greater, more complete range of people in our society. That is a principle that, at heart, I believe to be sound. My problem, however, is with the effect on the overall balance of our views on marriage and with why we have chosen to act in this way at this time to the exclusion of other possibilities.</p><p>I view marriage as an important cornerstone of our families and our society as a whole. During my lifetime, I have seen society begin to fall apart. I have seen families in instability, and I have seen individual children raised in difficult circumstances as a result. That is why I would argue that one of the priorities of the Parliament should be to strengthen families, to find ways to reinforce marriage and to reverse the trends of half a century and more in order to gain that stability. That is why I worry that we are making this policy a wrong priority at the wrong time.</p><p>During the conduct of its inquiry, the Equal Opportunities Committee, its members and all those who came before it treated the whole issue with a very high degree of mutual respect and maturity. The evidence that was given and the debate that took place were of the highest standard, and I commend the report that the committee produced. However, during its preparation and while we were taking evidence, I found that I had to dispute one or two issues.</p><p>Professor Curtice spoke about the level of public support. True enough&#8212;opinion polls indicate that support for the change is growing rapidly in society. I believe that similar polls also indicate that that is largely because people no longer have the care to commit to a particular policy. It may not be that people care more; it may be that people actually care less.</p><p>We have spoken about the redefinition of marriage. Other members have mentioned traditional marriage as a key element of what we have discussed. I believe that traditional marriage can be undermined by the proposed change. As a result, I ask the minister to say something either during the debate or before stage 2 about the other proposals that he has brought forward, such as the forthcoming review of same-sex civil partnerships. Is there any way that, during that process, he can consider how we might lend a hand to those people within families who require support to enjoy greater stability?</p><p>Elaine Smith raised the issue of tolerance. She was concerned that, once she had made her opinion public, she had suffered as a result. I have found that there is an extent, within the broader argument, to which that can happen&#8212;I have had some interesting emails&#8212;but that is just a measure of the passion that people hold within the debate. We need to promote tolerance through the debate, and we must ensure that it does not become a one-way street. It is important that that tolerance continues.</p><p>There is a requirement to protect the freedom of those who disagree with the change in legislation, whether they be religious bodies or staff in our public bodies, particularly teachers in our schools. I am worried that if we get this wrong we will create a situation that has certain parallels with the debate on section 28, which resulted in teachers, parents and pupils facing some very difficult circumstances.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752660", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have heard many of my colleagues who are in the chamber today being asked why they got involved in politics.

It was not an accident; it was a deliberate act of policy. First a Labour Government and then a coalition Government, here in the Scottish Parliament, decided to prioritise other things.</p><p>The road-building programme, which had seen substantial developments on our trunk road network, waited for 10 years. When the current Government came to power, first as a minority back in 2007, it was that Government that put roads back on the agenda. For that reason, I have told the minister many times that there is little that I can criticise about his road-building programme and I will rightfully continue to praise that change in policy. However, that alone does not constitute the modernising of Scotland&#8217;s transport infrastructure for the 21st-century. There is still much that we have to discuss and agree on.</p><p>Looking at the road-building programme, I still believe that there is one glaring omission from the priorities that the Government has identified. Although linking Scotland&#8217;s cities with dual carriageways or motorways is important, the priority should be to ensure that we complete our connections to the rest of the United Kingdom. Despite the differences of opinion on either side of the border, it should be a priority for our Government&#8212;and for our transport minister, by forging links with his counterpart south of the border&#8212;to see that the A1 is upgraded to become part of an east coast motorway network. Edinburgh and the east of Scotland have a great deal to gain from being linked to the north-east of England.</p><p>Similarly, this Government has failed to address the issue of accident blackspots, which are always on the minds of members of the Scottish Parliament. It remains a surprise to me that this Government and this minister will not act to deal with the problem surrounding the junction of the A90 and A937 at Laurencekirk. The pronouncements from Transport Scotland in recent months only make me think that there are none so blind as those who will not see.</p><p>Among the Government&#8217;s other priorities that the minister mentioned in his opening speech, there is of course the issue of buses, which was raised by the Labour Party. I have supported the changes that been made to the bus service operators grant, as I believe that they are constructive and positive. However, they are underfunded, and many of the problems that are described by the Labour Party and used as an excuse for re-regulation are in fact caused by changes in the funding level.</p><p>That brings me to the Labour Party&#8217;s amendment, which lists wholesome projects and priorities that we should all consider in the longer term. However, the determination to pursue the concept of centralised planning and the re-regulation of our bus industry are enough to frighten off a poor innocent Tory like me. I believe that we should work constructively with the bus companies here in Scotland. We should face the fact that it was deregulation that created the business opportunity for companies such as Stagecoach and First Group&#8212;two of the biggest transport groups in Europe&#8212;to get in there and become the successful businesses that they are. Let us praise those companies and not make the mistake of condemning them by attacking the regulatory system&#8212;or the lack of it, as is currently the case.</p><p>I am worried that the motion before us is not a plan for modernising our transport infrastructure in its entirety. As I state in my amendment, it gives the lie to the idea put about by John Swinney and others that there is a huge lack in capital investment. In these difficult times it seems rather clear that the Government, since it chooses to mention &#163;4&#160;billion of expenditure in its motion, is able to find investment resources for priorities when those come along.</p><p>The other great project that has been discussed across Britain as a whole is high-speed rail. Many members in the chamber, including some in the Government, have bought into the idea of a high-speed rail network. We have reached a critical phase in the project and, if it is to go ahead, we must now understand how it will develop, what it might cost and how that cost will be broken down between Scotland and England in future.</p><p>If the minister gets his way, and Scotland becomes an independent country, I cannot see why a UK Government would wish to extend the high-speed rail network any further north than Manchester or Leeds. We need some explanation of how Scotland, if it becomes an independent country, will benefit from that beyond simply being able to access that rail network by train.</p><p>If this Government believes that high-speed rail can come to central Scotland and deliver benefits to places such as Aberdeen and Inverness, we need some explanation of how it will pay its share, because there has never been a project that looks more like one for the United Kingdom.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-08270.3, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;; recognises that this level of investment shows that Scottish Government assertions about the lack of a significant capital budget are unfounded, and welcomes the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to modernising transport as evidenced by the commitment to delivering high speed rail.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22741929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Scotland&#8217;s Transport Infrastructure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It remains an eternal source of embarrassment to the politicians who were responsible that between 1997 and 2007 there was a hiatus in construction on our trunk road network.

It has covered a lot of subjects, although I have been criticised for not covering everything in my opening speech. I will try to cover one or two more points in my closing speech, but it must be said that, in such a debate, we cannot all be expected to cover everything.</p><p>The first issue that I will cover is cycling, which is in the Government motion, for which I intend to vote at 5 o&#8217;clock tonight. Cycling was covered at some length by my colleague Cameron Buchanan, who highlighted the fact that it has a lot to offer. Fiona McLeod also mentioned it extensively, and I accept what she said. I was interested in her suggestion that she would make Bishopbriggs the first 20mph town in Scotland. I have occasionally driven out of Edinburgh at rush hour, and I think that it has already beaten her on that, as the traffic is significantly slower than 20mph.</p><p>I need to cover one or two key issues, and I will dwell on rail for a moment. Scotland&#8217;s rail industry is becoming more and more important. Even if we ignore rail freight and look simply at the demand that passengers place on our rail services, we realise that demand is rising fast.</p><p>It is vital that, as we develop new routes, we ensure that they have the scope to provide services for larger numbers of passengers. Successful new stations and station expansions have resulted in significantly better improvements in passenger numbers than were shown in the business cases. We have scope to do a great deal with a limited resource to encourage rail travel.</p><p>We must also do more to cut journey times on the longer routes in Scotland. Passengers from Aberdeen and Inverness remain concerned that nothing is being done to shorten journey times between those cities and the central belt. If we are to take traffic off the roads, that is where the challenge lies. However, the railways themselves&#8212;the infrastructure on which the trains run&#8212;will be expensive to improve in those areas. There are many proposals that need to be considered and enacted quickly to achieve the objectives that we want.</p><p>A public transport idea that has not been touched on, but which has been discussed in committees several times over the years, is a Scotland-wide travel card. I throw that in now to see whether the Government is at the stage of taking that forward. We have spoken before about the possibility of having a card that is roughly equivalent to the Oyster card in London. Technology has been developed for the concessionary fares scheme in Scotland that begins to move us in that direction, but there has been concern that we are not quite ready to make the leap. We have not discussed the subject for a while. I ask the minister to take the opportunity to tell us whether any progress has been made.</p><p>Before we leave rail, I must mention high-speed rail again. I have significant concerns about where the money will come from to bring the benefits of high-speed rail to Scotland and pass them on to cities that are further north. The costs that are involved are likely to be extremely high. It is time that the Government told us exactly what funding mechanism it might choose to provide that level of rail development for its prospective independent Scotland. That might be covered in the independence white paper, although I doubt it. I look forward to hearing more from the Government about how that funding might be dealt with.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22741929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Scotland&#8217;s Transport Infrastructure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been a good, constructive and wide-ranging debate.

First, I would be a little reticent in accepting the SNP amendment&#8217;s description of the GARL project as &#8220;ill-conceived&#8221;. When it came forward, the scheme itself seemed very reasonable. Indeed, it seemed so reasonable that I think every party in the Parliament supported it. Who would not? It was a simple means of providing a valuable service. However, as the minister has pointed out, the estimated costs of work on the campus of the airport rose from &#163;7.8 million to &#163;16 million and then to &#163;70 million. That should have set alarm bells ringing all over the place, especially with the Government. When the estimated costs of the whole project doubled and then doubled again, alarm bells should certainly have been ringing. When grave concerns emerged about not only the likely outcome but the reasons for the increase in prices, I believe that the Government did the right thing and called a halt to the project.</p><p>That said, that does not solve the problem that we still have: there is still no rail link to Glasgow airport. That is why I chose to lodge what many might describe as a naive little amendment, and one that I do not expect to survive to be voted on. We simply encourage the Scottish Government</p><p>&#8220;to explore options for the future provision of a low-cost rail link that will connect Glasgow Airport to the national rail network.&#8221;</p><p>I have already heard some encouragement from the Government. In spite of the fact that there is continuing reluctance by the transport minister to become involved in a Government-sponsored project, he has spoken about the possibility of achieving that through private sector investment. As a Conservative, I believe that private sector investment has a great deal to be said for it. First, it will control the project costs, and, secondly, it will deliver a link that does what it is supposed to do and nothing else. There will be no bells or whistles&#8212;the expensive options that we see in some of the other transport projects around.</p><p>We should not take from the debate the negative&#8212;the arguing that will go on between the SNP Government and the Labour Party Opposition and the petty political point scoring that is inevitable in such situations.

I was glad to hear that he is a frugal man after my own heart; he assured us that he travelled on budget airlines.</p><p>A number of the serious issues that have been raised have been confused. Some members have sought to confuse and conflate issues to try to make something where nothing exists.</p><p>The whole argument comes down to the questionable business case. Rising costs called that business case into question, even if we accepted it at the outset. The Labour Party used the line that the decision to cancel the project was based on affordability rather than desirability. That indicates that Labour does not understand the importance of a business case in such a project. I would fully expect a business case to be produced for any such project or any attempt to restart the project in the long term.</p><p>The facts are simple. We can question the comment that the project was ill conceived&#8212;there is a side argument to have about that&#8212;but the project quickly demonstrated itself not to be justified on the ground of a business case, given the outturn costs of which we quickly became aware.</p><p>As I said, costs on the campus rose from &#163;7.8 million to an estimated &#163;70 million. The cost of the project went to an estimated &#163;176 million&#8212;that is the figure that I have, but we have heard the suggestion that it could have run to &#163;210 million. The project was proposed for the right reasons, but the costs got out of hand. I therefore believe that the Government took a responsible move in ending the project, although I would like to think that we could revisit it some day and achieve the objective.</p><p>A key issue that the Labour Party has put at the centre of the debate is the suggestion that something was wrong with the land deals. It is always a disappointment to buy something that is expensive and sell it cheaply. Anyone who has ever been involved in business might well have experience of that. However, the economy of the country and the value of things for buying and selling changed dramatically in the intervening period. That might have had something to do with the behaviour of a Labour Government elsewhere, but let us give it the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>As far as I am aware from the information that has been made available to date, there was no impropriety in the land deals. If the Labour Party suggests that there was, I am still waiting for the evidence to be presented to support that.</p><p>As a consequence, I find it hard to recommend that my Conservative colleagues vote for the motion or the SNP amendment, so we will abstain on both.

If only it were not necessary&#8212;but it is such a vital service. I remember hearing about Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid when it was first established in the 1970s and I am delighted to have learned more about it during the course of the debate.</p><p>One of the things that impresses me most about it is the fact that it is essentially a self-help approach to a particular domestic abuse problem, so I am delighted that it is an example of organisation that has allowed women to take control of their own lives and which has allowed them to build their self-confidence and security after such desperately disastrous domestic situations as domestic abuse have been allowed to take place.</p><p>I also want to talk about the rise in reported domestic abuse that we appear to be experiencing, which has been mentioned already. Like other members, I hope that it is a result of an increase in the willingness of individuals to report crime. I believe that we have seen a substantial change as regards the willingness of police and the justice system to be involved in domestic abuse issues. I hope that there is, as a consequence, more faith in the law and greater willingness among victims to come forward.</p><p>However, I believe that the key is the fact that the Women&#8217;s Aid approach is a self-help approach.

It is sad that we continue to require the support of organisations such as Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid for women who have become victims of domestic abuse, so I hope that we can, with the aid of all the parties in the chamber, continue to progress towards a situation where we can give more confidence to women and children who have become the victims of abuse, and that we may avoid that in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724850", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Having heard from the opening speech that only two men turned up at the commemorative event to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid, I am keen that as many men as possible participate in the debate, and am glad that I am able to be one of them.

The first thing that I learned as a result of the inquiry was how little I knew. I learned a great deal during the process.</p><p>Community transport means different things in different areas and different things to different people. There is an enormous diversity of provision and it can mean anything from a single volunteer who is willing to give up their time and car to give somebody a lift to a hospital or other appointment, right up to the voluntary sector organisations that are run like professional bus companies. We came across a number of those during the course of our inquiry. In fact, I commend the standards of professionalism in community transport in the voluntary sector and I think that we should all take the opportunity to do so today.</p><p>The sector is not without its problems, however, and we were able to dig them up during the course of the inquiry. The problems are fairly easy to define. We repeatedly came across references to the Community Transport Association and the fact that it appears to have had its budget and its staffing restricted. It was repeatedly named as an organisation that was best able to advise and support voluntary organisations providing community transport, but there was concern that one of its key staff members had recently had to be put on a part-time contract and that consequently they could not be contacted as often as previously. We need to consider providing more of the kind of support that the CTA provides. It would not take much resource to provide a continuous point to which hard-working and keen volunteers could refer to understand what they had to do to ensure that the transport system that they provide is strengthened.</p><p>When we get to the bottom of the issues, funding is always what we find down there; it is, and I suspect always will be, a contentious issue for community transport. Funding has now been devolved to local authorities. We can debate whether local, decentralised decision making is the same as a postcode lottery, but I believe that where such a diverse sector exists, ensuring that local decision making is in place and that local authorities can decide how they fund, based on what is required, is a key element in ensuring that the service provided fits communities&#8217; needs. I do not believe that the one-size-fits-all approach is desirable.</p><p>Of course, local authorities have their priorities and, as a result we see some local authorities being able to deliver what they want in relation to community transport while others have diverted resources away. That is extremely disappointing, but I believe that, at the bottom of the argument, there is a need to accept that local decision making must be allowed to take place.</p><p>When we look at the funding issue, we also need to consider the nature of short-term funding. People repeatedly told us that organisations that have only a handful of staff find that perhaps 20 per cent of the time of an individual staff member is spent pursuing the funding to keep the service going the following year. There is a particular aversion to the single-year funding arrangements that appear to be in place in so much of Scotland.</p><p>The other funding issue that was mentioned to us over and over again is the problem of capital funding for replacement vehicles. That problem is getting worse because the cost of vehicles is rising quickly. Indeed, it is perhaps rising more quickly than inflation would suggest that it should, because the standard of the vehicles is increasing and, consequently, the cost of maintaining them is increasing, too. I welcome the fact that the Government has acknowledged that there is a problem in that area and that it must be addressed in future.</p><p>Moving on from the problem of finance, we come to the issue of the support that is given to individuals and the suggestion that Age Scotland made in its still waiting campaign that concessionary travel should be extended to community transport. I accept the minister&#8217;s point that there is a mismatch in the suggestion that community transport should benefit from concessionary travel, but I disagree with his position that there is nothing that we can do. Perhaps here is the one area in which I diametrically oppose the position that the Government has taken today and on previous occasions.</p><p>The problem that we have with bus funding in Scotland is the dogmatic pursuit of a policy of no change to the concessionary travel scheme. The introduction of the green bus initiative and the changes to the bus service operators grant were constructive, positive and desirable, but the starvation of funds that has taken place as a result of the determination to maintain the concessionary travel scheme without change is the elephant in the room as far as all bus transport funding is concerned.</p><p>I repeat what I have said previously. I believe that it is right for us to align concessionary travel entitlement with pensionable age. By doing that, we can free up enough resource to consider doing something serious about delivering free transport through the community transport organisations. Only by taking that route can we give ourselves the opportunity to deliver the support that the organisations need.</p><p>I believe that we should promote diversity and not restrict it, because the one-size-fits-all approach will never deliver in community transport. I believe that we need to have a scheme in place to support organisations to replace their buses when necessary, and that the Community Transport Association is a valuable resource and one that we can underpin at a limited cost.</p><p>Finally, I believe that we need to continue to support across the board the training that is necessary for those people who do not have D1 entitlement. As was mentioned earlier, anyone who passed their test after 1997 does not have it. The number of people in their 20s who volunteer to drive minibuses is limited and I am worried that we have now got to the point where drivers in their 30s do not have the entitlement, as they are the ones who are volunteers. I believe that, by doing the right thing and supporting training where necessary, we can underpin a renaissance in community transport.</p><p>I should address one fear. Some people worry that, if we give young drivers training, they might just go off and get themselves a job. That is a risk that we have to take. If any young person finds a job as a result of training that is provided in that manner, I will be delighted.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22715881", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Prior to the committee&#8217;s inquiry, I thought that I knew a bit about community transport.

I have always learned new things&#8212;I assure Dennis Robertson that I do not expect ever to get to a stage in life at which I feel that I know everything&#8212;and the debate has been very educational for me.</p><p>On things that have been said, I have to pick out one or two key individuals who came up with really strong comments that we should all remember.</p><p>Duncan McNeil reminded us that the cost of community transport is insignificant compared with the cost of missed hospital appointments. If we look at the cost of running our health service in Scotland now, it is obvious that that is the truth. I will take that out and probably use it in subsequent speeches and claim it as my own, if nothing else.</p><p>In the same vein, Jim Eadie pointed out that perhaps one thing that we ought to do is find out more information about what community transport really saves us. If we have tough decisions to make about transport in the long term&#8212;especially the transport of the elderly and the disabled&#8212;and we know the real cost of community transport and can demonstrate how cost effective the service is, there will be an opportunity to invest to save. We should always be prepared to make that investment.</p><p>The most significant aspect is the quality of the people who we met during our inquiry. I will not name names, but we met individuals from throughout the north, south, east and west of Scotland from very different backgrounds and with very different experiences but who all brought something to the discussion.</p><p>Dennis Robertson suggested a moment ago that we could be smarter in how we run community transport. That is true, but I believe that some very smart people are involved in the sector already. If we make the right effort to support those people in what they do, they are capable of making decisions for us.</p><p>Maureen Watt suggested that there is perhaps space in the community planning system to involve those who run community transport organisations. I agree with that in principle, but I learned from the inquiry that volunteers who run community transport initiatives have probably very little time to get involved in community planning as well&#8212;more&#8217;s the pity.</p><p>We heard earlier at some length from Gordon MacDonald, who has considerable knowledge of and expertise in the bus industry. I was perhaps surprised but certainly pleased to discover that he and I agree on many of the key issues. I was not aware of an area of David Stewart&#8217;s expertise until he told us about it earlier. His involvement with SCVO brought him close to the point where decisions were being made about how money was allocated for community transport issues in 2005. I am glad that he was able to tell us about the tough decisions that were made then and how the industry that we have today was formed.</p><p>We heard from Cameron Buchanan that there are of course issues of isolation, because even in our cities there are people who cannot access the advantages of public transport simply because they are not on the routes. Elaine Murray said that concessionary fares are a good idea but that, if someone is not on a bus route and cannot get a bus, it does not matter to them whether there are concessionary fares. That is where community transport comes in, because it can provide a service for those who are not on a bus route and cannot take advantage of concessionary fares.</p><p>I will refer to one more comment from a member before I move on. There are often statements in a debate that are quite entertaining. I would have laughed out loud at this one had it not been for the fact that it was such a serious issue. It involved the irony that was highlighted by Joan McAlpine when she talked about visiting a community transport group and being told that they were applying for support to the Postcode Lottery. Given some of the things that have been said during this debate, how ironic is that?</p><p>The big challenge that lies ahead of us is to get the Parliament and the Government lined up to achieve the objectives that the report has set for them.</p><p>The minister indicated in his opening remarks that he already understands what the committee said in the report.

The number of accidents that have happened in the North Sea has served only to make the frustration greater.

It is important that there is an inclusive group, and the role of bringing the industry together with trade unions and other interested parties in the grouping is vital for the level of confidence that is delivered when an accident happens. I congratulate the group on its work.</p><p>Since then, of course, we have had the announcement that there will be a CAA review into the broader issues of helicopter safety in the North Sea. That is an important step forward, which I welcome. The fact that the review will also take into account what is happening in the Norwegian sector and perhaps give us the opportunity to draw comparisons between safety records and what is being done to achieve them will be something that will deliver in the long term.</p><p>The key element in the motion is the issue of fatal accident inquiries and the fact that there was no FAI into the worst of the fatal accidents, which happened in 2009 and left 16 dead.

We have heard a number of times today about the impact that the previous Conservative Government might have had on the industry. However, as many may have heard when I spoke in the debate in which we paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher earlier this year, I am one of the people who believe that it was Arthur Scargill&#8217;s determined drive to bring down a Conservative Government that cost us our deep mining industry. If we look at the mines, even in the Edinburgh area, that were closed down and were never reopened due to flooding that arose as a result of a lack of maintenance, we realise that there is a more complicated story to be told here.</p><p>The truth is that Scotland is a country that is well endowed with energy sources, and that coal was one of the biggest of those. Scotland&#8217;s coal reserves are still immense, and they will be exploited in different ways as time goes on. The deep mines are gone and, in recent years, opencast mining has been what has enabled Scotland to maintain its huge coal production. Now, however, we have hit a problem. The value of coal has undermined the industry, creating all the problems that we are addressing today.</p><p>Some options have been brought forward during the debate, such as taking action to push up the price of coal. Unfortunately, we cannot consider that as a route by which we can deal with the problem because, as we know&#8212;as many of us have repeatedly pointed out in the chamber&#8212;energy costs are already too high. Whether someone is in fuel poverty or is involved in an industry that is trying to maintain its position in the world market, energy costs are absolutely key to the long-term future. We must therefore consider how we can proceed in a way that will ensure that we can keep energy cost-effective in Scotland.</p><p>There are alternatives to what we are doing with coal. We could, of course, go down the road of carbon capture and storage, which would deal with the problem of carbon dioxide emissions. There are also those who believe that, in the long term, we might find a way in which to exploit our coal reserves by bringing the energy up and leaving the carbon where it is. However, for the long term, we have to deal with the problems that we have been discussing today.</p><p>A number of members have contributed to that discussion. There was a detailed&#8212;in fact, at times quite moving&#8212;speech by Adam Ingram, who talked about the situation in East Ayrshire. East Ayrshire had a very successful opencast mining industry, which the collapse of Scottish Coal and Aardvark has, of course, significantly undermined. I pay tribute to the way in which East Ayrshire Council has taken up cudgels and gone ahead and prepared its own report, &#8220;Opencast Mining in East Ayrshire&#8212;Steps to Recovery&#8221;, which will be published on Thursday this week, I believe. I look forward to hearing the ministerial reaction to that report to see whether it can offer a way in which we can deal with the collapse of opencast mining. On behalf of the Conservatives, I also particularly thank Councillor Tom Cook of East Ayrshire Council, who has been our contact in the area and has kept us informed about what is going on.</p><p>We have heard interesting arguments, sometimes in the same speech. Claudia Beamish faced both ways on the priority of coal. She reminisced with a good degree of warmth about the good old days of the miners&#8217; strike and then talked about the importance of not allowing coal to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696519", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Opencast Mining"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Let us take a moment to draw breath, pause and apply some common sense to the discussion.

My motivation to speak up in favour of the union drew me into this argument when I was very young&#8212;in fact, by next summer I will have been participating in the campaign for a full 40 years. The sooner it is over, the better.</p><p>The debate has been enlightening in some respects. We have a common agreement around the chamber that the bill that is before us is the bill to achieve the objective that we want, although reservations have been voiced, including complaints that have been made about purdah arrangements. Surely we can deal with a two-day overlap, as men and women together, through the systems of the Parliament, thereby perhaps avoiding some of the difficulties to which it could give rise.</p><p>Spending limits have also been raised by a number of contributors to the debate. It is important that spending limits be set and adhered to, and there will be plenty of opportunity during stages 2 and 3 to ensure that any concerns that still exist are addressed. I am reassured by the fact that the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to the stage 1 report already contains a significant number of proposals for changes to be made to fine tune that element of the bill.</p><p>Some members chose to make the debate the start of the campaign&#8212;not least the Deputy First Minister, who was determined that separation could be a means by which to avoid many of the difficult decisions that many western democracies face at the moment. During the campaign we may see that difficult decisions cannot be avoided, and one or two others will become relevant as the process continues.</p><p>There were some light-hearted moments during the debate. Tavish Scott and Shona Robison appeared to get themselves involved in a debate over how we might bring the Commonwealth games into the campaign. I was reminded of seeing on television that scene from the Olympic games in which a number of leading politicians, including Boris Johnson and Ed Miliband, could be seen dancing during the opening ceremony. There, at the back of the box, was a certain Shona Robison. If there is anything positive to be said about that, it is that she was at least the best dancer in that box.</p><p>As we move towards the referendum, it is important that we have a basis on which we can progress, and I believe that the bill, in its current form, provides that basis. As a consequence we, with others around the chamber, will support the bill at stage 1 tonight.</p><p>I will close by talking a bit about Bruce Crawford&#8217;s conduct at the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee. It has been said by many members, including my colleague Annabel Goldie, that he has done a sterling job in ensuring that the committee has been conducted properly and fairly and that it has produced a report that is fair to all those who contributed. I would have expected nothing less of Bruce Crawford. It is no surprise that he has been able to achieve that. [Applause.]</p><p>Bruce Crawford talked about the nature of the campaign; I would like to close by saying a little about that subject. We are all Scots and we are all passionate about Scotland&#8217;s past, its present and its future. As a result of the bill, in a little over a year&#8217;s time we will have made a decision, and some of us will be extremely disappointed. Therefore, it is essential that we have legislation in place that allows us to conduct the campaign with courtesy and decency and in circumstances that allow us to express our passion. When this is over, we will all be in Scotland together and we will have to make it work, whatever the outcome. I am grateful that the bill provides a sound basis on which to have a fair campaign; I only hope that we are all able to work together to make that so.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not, and never have been, a member of the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee.

If we were not part of the UK economy, we might be suffering some of the ill effects that other European countries are suffering today.</p><p>That failure to regard the importance of that relationship has been the theme of today. Earlier today, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth delivered his budget statement, which in my view was a responsible, balanced and&#8212;within his own policy priorities&#8212;sound statement. However, he spoiled it all by saying that he balanced the budget only because of the fiscal discipline that is imposed on him by the Scottish block grant and that if he were not subject to that discipline, he would break the bank, blow the budget and reverse every one of the hard-earned gains of the past three years. Similarly, Fergus Ewing and many of his back benchers, in taking the opportunity to take sideswipes at the UK and the UK economy, have also chosen today to destroy what could have been a reasonably consensual debate.</p><p>On the amendment in the name of Jenny Marra, I must say that we on this side of the chamber will find it difficult to support. In my view, a root and branch review of our enterprise networks would be a mistake at this stage. It is important to recognise that there have been radical changes in the enterprise networks, in which review has played a significant part. At the same time, I believe that a responsible minister&#8212;I believe that we have a responsible minister&#8212;will keep the network constantly under review and ensure that he addresses the needs of the network in a constructive manner. Indeed, in his opening speech the minister made it clear that during today&#8217;s debate and subsequently, he is seeking ideas and is willing to work together with others.</p><p>I turn to my colleague Murdo Fraser&#8217;s amendment. I have to say that there is some concern about the performance of the intermediary technology institutes, so I welcome the minister&#8217;s offer in that respect.</p><p>However, the enterprise network&#8217;s tendency over the years to indulge in the practice of picking winners was also mentioned. We do not want the network to decide who will succeed or who will fail; instead, we want it to pick the companies that will deliver the best growth, the best employment and the best long-term returns for the Scottish economy. What concerns me most about the Labour Party&#8217;s position, which was set out at some length by Margaret McDougall and supported in some respects by Ken Macintosh, is that it wants to pick companies not on the basis of potential to succeed for Scotland, but more on the basis of geography, social criteria and&#8212;I believe&#8212;even gender. It seems to be a case not so much of picking winners as of deliberately picking losers. If that is the kind of review of the enterprise network that the Labour Party wants, I am not prepared to address it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696119", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Enterprise Networks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been useful, in that we have skirted round many points that concern the current position of the enterprise networks and the direction in which they should go.

I arrived on the committee between the two reports that we are now discussing. The first report was very much the responsibility, as far as the Conservatives were concerned, of my colleague Annabel Goldie. However, I took over in time for the second report. I note that that report says that I became a member of the committee on 17 January, but that is perhaps a slight misrepresentation, as I think that I had been attending the committee for two months as a substitute before I became an official committee member.</p><p>The experience of preparing the report &#8220;Where Gypsy/Travellers Live&#8221; was something that I genuinely enjoyed. I have had a certain amount of awareness of the problems relating to the Gypsy Traveller community within the north-east&#8212;my own region&#8212;for some time. In the past, I have taken the opportunity to go on to unauthorised sites and speak to the Gypsy Travellers to find out their views. However, the opportunity to meet Gypsy Travellers in their own environment and here in the Parliament was one that I enjoyed. I discovered, for example, that one of the limited number of families within the Gypsy Traveller community bears my own name. On the morning of 4 February in Clinterty, when we had an informal discussion, I found myself sitting beside a young man. When I introduced myself to him, saying, &#8220;Hello, my name is Alex Johnstone,&#8221; he said, &#8220;So is mine.&#8221;</p><p>We also met a broad range of representatives that day. Those of us who got to meet Sammy Stewart will always remember that he was a good laugh and a man who missed his calling as a stand-up comedian. I suppose that one of the ironies, which we never quite got to the bottom of, was that it appeared to be only men who were willing to talk to us that day at Clinterty, whereas only three days later, when we had a round-table session in the Parliament, we met only women from the Traveller community.</p><p>As I said, although we never quite got to the bottom of that divide, we found that Travellers themselves are very articulate and very well able to put across their views. They are one of those groups who will always be able to express themselves fluently but who do not benefit as they should from that fluency.</p><p>We discovered, for example, that the problems that Gypsy Travellers face and the problems that are faced by the settled community relating to Gypsy Travellers differ significantly across Scotland. We heard that there seems to be a particularly smooth relationship in the Argyll area compared with that in other parts of Scotland and that in large parts of the south-west a significant number of Travellers are in permanent accommodation. We also heard that in the north-east, which is my home ground, there is quite a degree of seasonal movement. That is where the problem can arise in relation to unauthorised camps.</p><p>We also heard&#8212;at some length&#8212;that significant problems face the community relating to accommodation and the provision of healthcare and education. I should also pay tribute to the number of young people from the Gypsy Traveller community who were able to talk to us fluently and express their needs and desires, although they had only limited access to education.</p><p>I believe that there is a great deal in the report&#8217;s recommendations that is worthy of support. In fact, the Conservatives support the broad thrust of the report. However, there are one or two concerns that I believe we need to address.</p><p>Local authorities, especially those in the north-east, have been unable to solve the problem of unauthorised encampments, which has persisted for many years. Similarly, private landowners have been left to deal with the problem on their own while the police maintain their presumption against prosecution. For ordinary people who are faced with an unauthorised encampment in their community, there seems to be no support whatsoever, while Travellers themselves know all their rights, have the support of human rights groups and are only too aware of how far they can exploit an establishment that is afraid to act for fear of criticism.</p><p>The Scottish Government has a long record of failure to address the real concerns of the settled community regarding unauthorised encampments. In the face of that, it is extremely important that strong leadership is delivered. The evidence of the local authorities in the north-east is that, in spite of the fact that there is a determined effort to establish the campsites that are necessary to deal with the problem, there is inevitably political pressure that undermines that.</p><p>If local authorities are unfit to take the matter through to its conclusion, there is no alternative but strong leadership from the Scottish Government in order to force through the changes. Discussion groups will not deliver. During the inquiry, COSLA resisted the invitation to become a significant part of the process. For that reason, I look forward to hearing what the Government will do in response to the report, but I also look forward to the day when it will deliver that strong leadership and we eventually begin to progress the long-term solution to this unfortunate problem.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Where Gypsy Travellers Live"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin, as other speakers have done, by saying a few words about the revolving door that is the Equal Opportunities Committee.

When people such as Christopher Ahern, the chairman of North Muirton community council, and James Brownhill, the vice-chairman of Nigg community council, came before the committee, they were treated quite robustly, although all they were doing was expressing the minority view that exists around Scotland and the view that is put directly opposite the one that is expressed by many of those who speak out in favour of the traditional Traveller community.</p><p>It has to be said that I agree with a number of things that have been said, and perhaps I should have agreed with them earlier. John Mason, for one, and both members of the McMahon family, for another two, pointed out that when we talk about Government failing to give leadership, it is not just this Government that is a problem. We have been through a 12-year process and successive Governments have failed to deliver. Earlier Governments and, of course, this Government in an earlier form took the view that the subject should be dealt with by local authorities, but the evidence now increasingly points to the fact that local authorities are unable to achieve the objective through the local democratic process. That is why strong leadership is so important.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Where Gypsy Travellers Live"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been an interesting debate.

Although I disagree with certain points, the broad thrust of what they contain appeals to the Conservative side of the chamber.</p><p>That said, I must take issue with one or two speakers. Mike MacKenzie&#8217;s comments about the use of plain English stood in stark contrast to the way in which the minister opened the debate, which gave me the clear impression that this morning his office had been playing buzzword bingo. The jargon, the planning-speak, the clich&#233;s, the alliteration and even onomatopoeia were to the fore in great scale but through the mist I could detect a number of issues with which I could agree.</p><p>I and many other people in the debate have talked about the commitment to town centres. Our town centres form a vital part of our country; in fact, Scotland can be defined by its smaller and medium-sized market towns and, if they are allowed to die, the very heart of Scotland will disappear. The most heartfelt plea for Scotland&#8217;s town centres came from Anne McTaggart, during whose speech I got the clear indication that some shop to live while others live to shop.</p><p>An interesting discussion took place when the minister himself suggested that some people took the view that the NPF document was all about wind farms. We all know that, in fact, it is just mostly about wind farms. The issue that was raised&#8212;significantly by Patrick Harvie&#8212;was about where we choose to put wind farms and some of the minister&#8217;s language on that is the kind of language that we have been asking for from successive planning ministers for years. However, I am not entirely convinced that this process will deliver strategic guidance on the timescale that many of us would like, even now.</p><p>On the subject of whether a single wind turbine constitutes a wind farm, I am no expert in that area. However, I can look back at this Parliament&#8217;s history and point out that, during the passage of the hunting bill, we received advice that one dog could in fact constitute a pack. I do not know whether that point can be carried over.</p><p>On the issue of grid enhancement for the distribution of electricity, it is essential that we all back the principle of grid enhancement as a key element of what we try to do in the long term. We know that it is not easy; the experience of the Beauly to Denny line and the planning process that that had to go through will make it extremely difficult for us to progress grid enhancement as quickly as we would all like. Although there are those of us who are concerned about the massive spread of wind farms, it is of course the case that if we are to develop environmentally based electricity sources in the long term, Scotland&#8217;s grid must be enhanced. For that reason, we look forward to rising to that challenge as well.</p><p>An interesting point in the debate was when Sarah Boyack seemed to suggest that we are still in a recession. I do not believe that Scotland is in a recession; I believe that we are doing extremely well. In fact, the employment figures that were announced earlier today indicate that Scotland is even doing rather better from the far-sighted and ambitious policies of George Osborne than the rest of the United Kingdom is. That advantage might have been accrued from the fact that we here in Scotland were freed from the dead hand of Labour control a full three years before the UK was and, consequently, we had a head start.</p><p>I move on to an area that is perhaps critical of the Government. Margaret Mitchell spoke at some length about the enforcement issues that surround planning and it would be remiss of me if I did not raise the issue that I have raised before in relation to this subject&#8212;that of timescales. The efficiency of the planning system in Scotland is vital to our economic wellbeing. We all know that planning applications can be contentious and even divisive in communities, but the situation that we find ourselves in is that planning applications&#8212;major planning applications in particular&#8212;are taking longer and longer.</p><p>Anything that was deemed to be a major development in the third quarter of 2012-13, which are the most recent figures that I have, was taking 36 weeks. Individual times ranged from eight weeks right through to an astonishing 84 weeks. That is 84 weeks of frustration and delay, bringing with it the continuing risk that another local economy might miss out on investment. Processing times, including legal agreements, make further grim reading, with an average of 103 weeks. That is almost two years to process an application, which is not fair on investors or on the communities that may be opposing those developments.</p><p>As I bring my remarks to a conclusion, I wish to say more about unconventional gas. I believe that the documents describe it as an opportunity. I believe that it is an opportunity that we must explore in order to create the jobs and wealth that gas production can bring, as well as providing the opportunity to cut energy costs.

The answers disappointed me, as they did the coaches concerned, and they failed to address the real concerns about the low level of qualification and expertise required to start up a sports club.</p><p>One such example that has been shown to me is that of a franchise opportunity that involves the franchisee doing a five-day course that qualifies them to open their own sports club. I am sure that the majority of people would agree that five days appears to be an extremely short period of time to turn someone who may have little sporting experience into a fully qualified instructor, especially given the possibility of injuries to young athletes arising from poor-quality coaching.</p><p>I want greater participation in sport, which not only brings health benefits but teaches discipline and team working and comes with great socialising opportunities. Sports clubs, especially in rural areas, are extremely important for those reasons.</p><p>I am deeply concerned that, while NHS Scotland encourages parents to get their children active and into sport for the long-term benefit of our population, the education minister tinkers with the curriculum for excellence and the sports minister promises glossy strategies and programmes for the people while delivering only for a sporting elite in the hope that it might inspire others. The Scottish Government&#8217;s record to date would hardly put it on the winner&#8217;s podium. Considerably more can and must be done to encourage greater participation in sport.</p><p>It is also vital that the Scottish Government takes on board the concerns of highly qualified coaches about the lack of regulation among those who operate outside the system. The bottom line is that, when an individual or family decides to take up a sport, they must be able to have confidence that what is on offer is of suitable calibre and is taught appropriately.</p><p>Like everyone else in Scotland, I am very much looking forward to the Commonwealth games and I am certain that they will be a great success. There is no doubt that the investment in facilities will benefit young Scots for a long time to come, but the greatest service to the people of Scotland would be a regulated and supported sporting pathway, starting in schools and being progressed via a properly regulated sports industry that is fit for a modern Scotland.

That gives people not only a real voice in their neighbourhood but an undoubted sense of empowerment, which can have a powerful impact in other areas of their lives.</p><p>Against the backdrop of that exceptional work by housing associations, the latest housing statistics that the Scottish Government released yesterday make for grim reading.

It is perhaps best at delivering housing for an increasingly mobile population, who for many reasons require flexibility in how they seek and keep a home. The figures speak for themselves, with 49 per cent of tenants in the private rented sector having been at their current address for less than a year and a further 25 per cent for less than two years.</p><p>The sector is a growth industry. It has doubled in the past 10 years but, in reality, it remains smaller than it was as recently as 1979. To put the issue into further perspective, the sector is 50 per cent smaller than it was in 1945. I want the private rented sector to continue to grow and to make a positive contribution to the safe and sustainable communities in which we all want to live.</p><p>In my view, the vast majority of those who are involved in the sector are responsible and professional and they wish to provide a good service. I was therefore extremely disappointed when I recently read a press release from Shelter that, in effect, damned the whole industry with pejorative terms such as &#8220;Wild West&#8221;, &#8220;flagrant disregard for the law&#8221; and &#8220;cowboy letting agents&#8221;.</p><p>The fact is that organisations that represent the private rented sector have for some time been open to the introduction of the kind of regulation that protects private landlords and tenants. However, those with whom I have discussed the issue are concerned that, so far, the proposals are not cohesive. Local authorities lack the resources to police the landlord registration scheme effectively and not enough action is taken when rogue or non-compliant landlords are uncovered.</p><p>I have had a number of complaints about delays in returning deposits but, ironically, they were not from tenants complaining about landlords; instead, they were from landlords who have used the kind of approved schemes that we have been discussing. Although those issues might be resolved over time, organisations that I met today highlighted that, at present, when there is disagreement between tenant and landlord over a deposit, the process can take up to 109 days to resolve whereas, in the past, a landlord might have been in a position simply to hand over a cheque to a tenant at the end of a tenancy.</p><p>In my experience, the private rented sector is as keen as any other interested party to address the issues that are raised in the motion. I cannot help but feel that there is much to be gained by more fully engaging with landlords and doing so in a positive and constructive manner. I believe that that would result in a much more effective system that proactively roots out rogue landlords. That opportunity undoubtedly exists.</p><p>As we proceed with proposals for further regulation, I ask the minister to consider that, with housing regulation and with regulation more widely, it is too easy to look at the effectiveness of regulation and decide that, where we would like the situation to be improved, we should tighten up the regulation. However, the problem is that, when that happens, those who are compliant with regulation find themselves dealing with a bigger burden and those who previously chose to be non-compliant remain so. In my view, the issue is therefore primarily one of enforcement. The good landlords are already doing what we want them to do and the bad landlords are not.

Through working in collaboration with the Government, new services and new stations have been developed, which genuinely demonstrates the effectiveness of the current system. The Government will, of course, point out the difficulties that have been associated with the west coast main line franchise, but any criticism of that will be put to bed when we eventually come to a conclusion on the Clyde and Hebrides ferries contract, on which the Government seems determined to drag its feet over the long term.</p><p>There are a number of key issues that it will be necessary to address during the debate. First, there is an issue surrounding the balance of the contributions of the fare payer and the taxpayer in provision of public rail services. We heard from the minister, in his opening remarks, about the efforts that are being made to keep fares down. I acknowledge that the minister has pursued that policy objective in a quite obvious fashion. Nevertheless, I am repeatedly contacted by people who are concerned about the figure of &#163;511.5&#160;million&#8212;it is cited in the Labour Party&#8217;s amendment&#8212;which is the cost to the public purse of maintaining rail services in Scotland. We must keep that balance in mind and remember that we cannot criticise the level of support at a time when the Government is increasing its support in order to keep fares down. We cannot criticise both sides without realising that there is a balance to be struck. Although I may, at times, argue about the nature of that balance, I am not prepared to condemn the level of support when it is obvious why the Government has chosen to increase it at this time.</p><p>Secondly, I turn to the efforts that have been made by Scotland&#8217;s rail operators to produce new services. There are a number of examples of how profits that have been made by the ScotRail franchise holder have been ploughed back into provision of new services. In fact, the franchise extension that took place during the current franchise is an example of how a deal can be done with the Government to take money from the profits of the company and invest it back in services. When that was addressed in Parliament at the time, we supported the action of the Government in pursuing that aim.</p><p>The third and final issue that I will address is the key issue in the Labour Party amendment, and which is covered to some extent by the Green Party amendment, that somehow we should find a way to take Scotland&#8217;s rail industry either partially or totally back into public ownership.</p><p>I believe that many of the improvements that are mentioned in the Government&#8217;s motion are genuine examples of how the current system can work. Of course there have been difficulties with the west coast main line and east coast main line franchises, but the quality of service that the franchisees provide is a credit only to those who provide it. At the end of the day, ensuring that the current system is properly administered will deliver rail services that will continue to improve, continue to provide higher levels of passenger satisfaction, offer improved performance and, if managed correctly, provide better value for money for the taxpayer and the fare payer alike.</p><p>Only if we persist with the current system will we be able to see those improvements take place. If we fall back on a system that is designed to run on a nationalised or not-for-profit basis, we will run the risk of making all the same mistakes that were made in previous decades.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692582", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Railways"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will not, at this stage.

Contributory factors such as drug and alcohol abuse, either by the individual or, perhaps more likely, a member of their peer group, can result in a chaotic lifestyle and ultimately have a catastrophic effect on neighbours and the wider community. That leads to the young person&#8217;s eviction, and the revolving door of homelessness starts up, which obviously has significant costs for the young person, the community and the public purse. That scenario is played out again and again, which highlights the need for greater support to allow young people to maintain their tenancies and make a positive contribution to the safe and stable communities that we all want, whatever our age.</p><p>Allocation policies need to be addressed. For a young person, finding a home can be an immense challenge. Some private sector landlords are reluctant to give a tenancy to a young person, while others might choose to offer a property that is otherwise difficult to let, perhaps because of its location or condition. That results in a reliance on social housing providers, particularly local authorities. However, I argue that the system is not geared to allow our well-qualified and hugely committed housing officers the flexibility to give young people the best chance of successfully maintaining their tenancy. Add to that the omnipresent threat of the judicial cosh wielded by a certain well-known homelessness charity, and the task becomes increasingly difficult from the outset. That is especially true when we consider the range of short-term options that are available, including the use of bed and breakfast accommodation and hostels. The B and B often proves to be the most inappropriate, and is always the most expensive, for those who need accommodation.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report refers to variable service availability throughout Scotland. Through contact with constituents, I was already aware of that issue. Some excellent organisations do sterling work helping to provide furniture, starter packs, budgeting advice and simple cookery books; the issue is that the level of service is not standard throughout Scotland. There are additional concerns that available services are not always as joined up as they could be.</p><p>I do not always advocate the spend-to-save model of funding services but, when it comes to preventing homelessness for young people, I find the case for doing so to be overwhelming. The Scottish Government&#8217;s spending choices make that model extremely challenging for local authorities&#8212;and, indeed, the third sector, which often provides much-needed services&#8212;and will make it even more difficult for all concerned in the future. It is tragic that young people who may already have been let down by the system may ultimately be let down by it again.</p><p>The report should act as a wake-up call to the Scottish Government. If we are to level the playing field for all young people as they seek to make their way in the world, we must consider all possible facets, including tenancy agreements, allocations policies, the funding of support mechanisms, social housing construction and the many others that contribute to making the issue as pressing as it is.</p><p>As the minister said, the number of people in temporary accommodation has gone down, but that is only after a marked and consistent rise from around 4,000 in 2002 to more than 11,000 in 2012.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives call on the Scottish Government to take cognisance of the report and put in place the bold solutions that we need to combat the issues that it describes.

First, we have had the usual riling against the right to buy. I will pass briefly over that by saying that we should value and learn from mixed-tenure communities created by the right to buy. Those communities&#8217; existence is a strength for our housing sector, and those strong, stable communities often provide examples of how things could be done better in the future. Perhaps finding a way to form such strong, stable communities in a post-right-to-buy environment should be a priority for the Government.</p><p>It has been suggested that the shortage of building activity in Scotland today is somehow entirely the fault of the Westminster Government&#8217;s budget cuts, but I have analysed a number of budgets over the years, and I see social housing being prioritised for disproportionate cuts. As a consequence, the housing association sector has been driven almost to the wall, and local authorities have been building properties&#8212;for the first time in a generation, in some cases. However, only local authorities that can borrow are building, and those that cannot borrow are not, so the level of building is not consistent across Scotland.</p><p>Support has been given during the debate for educating young people for life.

I therefore rise to support the motion in the minister&#8217;s name.</p><p>Members: Hear, hear.</p><p>I am surprised by how that impressed back benchers.</p><p>I support the decision to go ahead with the change in the management of the Forth road bridge to accommodate the new bridge and structures. It is perhaps surprising that we have reached this stage with no amendments made and almost unanimity in the Parliament. That is because it has been a long road to get to where we are. The decision to go for this particular management structure, which brings an end to FETA and simply manages the bridge and its approach roads as a contract that would do for any other part of the trunk road network, is the best option.</p><p>There have been one or two moments of controversy, which it would be inappropriate not to mention at this stage. There was the question of the quality of the consultation that took place. I believe that the Government got that right, but it is not the first time in recent months that we have had question marks over consultation. Perhaps the Government must look at that, to ensure that all parties feel that they are adequately consulted on future legislation.</p><p>There was also concern over the transfer of liabilities. Right up to the end of the committee&#8217;s stage 1 proceedings, there appeared to be significant concerns, particularly from the City of Edinburgh Council, which believed that it was not being absolved of liabilities. The minister&#8217;s timely and decisive letter cleared that argument up once and for all.</p><p>In this short opening speech, it is appropriate for me to take the opportunity to pay tribute to FETA and the work that it has done. FETA and its staff have demonstrated their ability to manage the existing Forth crossing, and we can all welcome the fact that many of its staff will transfer to the successor organisation and continue to do that good job.</p><p>However, it was under FETA that the most divisive and perhaps inappropriate decision was made in recent years, which caused me to believe that councillor representation in the process was negative, rather than positive. The Parliament&#8217;s decisions to permit city entry charges and to require a local referendum to implement them meant that Edinburgh went through the process of having local councillors campaign for city entry charges and then, in the local referendum campaign, against the imposition of city entry charges.</p><p>As a result, councillors on FETA suggested that the Forth road bridge tolls should be made variable, with the option of charging up to &#163;4 for cars at certain times as a proxy for the city entry charges that they could not have. Local councillors in Edinburgh proposing changes to the Forth road bridge toll to get round the problem that they created for themselves was an abuse of power. The fact that, as a result of actions by the Parliament, that never actually happened is a good thing. Nevertheless, the proposal called into question the actions of the councillors behind it.</p><p>It remains my view that it is an advantage in the process that ministers will have responsibility for the future management of the bridges. As a consequence, if we in the Parliament have a problem with a bridge&#8217;s management, we can take it to the minister and have a more direct and responsible line of accountability than we would otherwise have had.</p><p>I will say a few words in response to, and in support of, what the minister said about the new bridge. The three bridges together across the Forth will be iconic. If the rail bridge achieves its objective of gaining world heritage status, the whole area of the bridges will become significant for tourism. The opportunities that that presents are worthy of support and our enthusiastic promotion, and I believe that that will be a tremendous advantage for Scotland as well as the Edinburgh area.</p><p>My preferred option for the bridge&#8217;s name is St Margaret&#8217;s crossing, and I will encourage everybody to adopt that name whenever possible. I want that name to be on the bridge for ever more. After that, the only thing to achieve will be the canonisation of Margaret Thatcher, and my work will be done.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692097", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the minister and members will be aware, I like nothing better than a good fight but, to justify that position, it must also be my position to agree with the Government when I do agree with it.

Therefore, it was reasonable to think that the tolls should no longer be charged once the bridge had been paid for, but the tolls were then justified by the cost of maintaining the bridge.

Therefore, in my view, it is entirely appropriate that we end the practice of having a separate board or organisation for dealing with the bridges. We should now be in the position where, given that the Government pays for maintenance of the facility, he who pays the piper should call the tune. It is important that we have ministerial responsibility and accountability for how the bridge is managed, because the Government will be responsible for deciding how it is funded.</p><p>I do not believe that ministerial accountability is a weak route for accountability. Being able to hold Government ministers to account in Parliament is a key part of ensuring public accountability. In recent years, the tendency for Government to form arm&#8217;s-length organisations, which are under ministerial control to some extent, but can take the blame when things go wrong, has in effect weakened ministerial accountability in many areas.

That of course is why a previous Conservative Government back in the 1980s began the process of ensuring that the road connections to Aberdeen and in the Aberdeen area were improved. That Conservative Government dualled the A90 all the way to Aberdeen. That same Conservative Government began the process of dualling the A96 with major work at Inverurie, and its final act before the 1997 election was for my old friend James Douglas Hamilton to take responsibility for cutting the first sod for the construction of the Kintore bypass.</p><p>The bypass was eventually opened by Henry McLeish. He took the opportunity to do that, but then unfortunately presided over a change in policy that meant that investment in road networks was downgraded and remained so for a full 10 years. That unfortunate circumstance has led to many of the problems that we see in Aberdeen today. However, Aberdeen&#8217;s bottlenecks are more than simply the Haudagain roundabout, because there is of course the Brig o&#8217; Dee and the Bridge of Don, and the desperate need for a third Don crossing, which challenge has been taken up by the Conservative councillors on Aberdeen City Council.

I suggest that the statistics that Mary Scanlon produced indicate that that apparent failure to pass on the benefit simply masks the fact that costs were rising quickly and that, the minute RET was removed from the road haulage industry, the effects on traffic and trade were immediately obvious to anyone who studied the figures closely.</p><p>I must also cover the issue of overall cost. That is a more general issue, and I will deal with it in a fairly abstract sense. When a public transport service is provided, whatever it is, there is a vital balance to be struck between the fare payer and the taxpayer as regards the cost of running the service.

When we deal with the issues that surround welfare reform, we all have to accept that we have a responsibility to ensure that assistance is given wherever it can be and that people understand the availability of assistance. It is therefore important that I pay tribute to Citizens Advice Scotland for the work that it does and continues to do to support vulnerable people through these difficult times as we change the welfare system substantially.</p><p>The fundamental purpose of the welfare reform is to ensure that resources go to those who need them most and that the resources available are targeted to where they can be most effective and provide the best support for those in need. However, there is an in-built inertia in any system, and we must not be trapped into allowing resistance to change to become the centre of policy.</p><p>On the issue of digital by default, the UK Government&#8217;s decision to go for the target that 80 per cent of applications should be made online has stirred up a degree of controversy, but a couple of things must be said. First, the information that has been made available by Citizens Advice Scotland is based on CAS&#8217;s client group, which even a cursory examination of the figures will show is not statistically similar to the broader society as a whole. Consequently, the Citizens Advice Scotland figures do not necessarily include those who are able to make applications by digital means&#8212;they are excluded from the figures.</p><p>Indeed, in evidence to the Welfare Reform Committee only this morning, Department for Work and Pensions officials suggested that, across the country as a whole, 50 per cent of applications are now made online. In some areas in Scotland, such as Orkney, the 80 per cent online target has already been achieved, so there is an indication that the target is achievable.</p><p>Furthermore, the DWP officials made it clear that the target is 80 per cent&#8212;not 100 per cent&#8212;and there is a deep understanding of the fact that some individuals will find it difficult to apply online. As a consequence, money has been made available to support the activities of Citizens Advice Scotland so that it can contribute towards assisting such people. In addition, jobcentre staff should be in a position to assist individuals in making online applications. I am aware that there is no shortage of individual stories about situations in which that has not happened and difficulties have been experienced, but it is our duty as politicians to highlight those stories to ensure that the necessary support is provided in future and that individuals are not exposed to similar difficulties.</p><p>As many members know, I am fully supportive of the need for welfare reform and I will continue to support the UK Government to achieve that objective.

I will see what I can do.</p><p>I very much welcome the fact that the Public Petitions Committee has decided to debate the petition on the floor of the Parliament. As has been pointed out, Professor Crichton&#8217;s petition is specifically about ensuring that Scottish interests are represented in the negotiations that are taking place with the insurance industry, but on an afternoon such as this&#8212;when there seems to be plenty of time available&#8212;many of us will want to take the opportunity to talk at some length about the impact of flooding in Scotland, including its impact on the insurance industry and on insurance premiums.</p><p>As is pointed out in the briefing paper for today&#8217;s debate, and as Chic Brodie pointed out in his opening remarks,</p><p>&#8220;Scotland does not face the same degree of flooding as the rest of the UK, due principally to differing topography.&#8221;</p><p>That is very much the case, but Scotland&#8217;s differing topography can also cause some of our most severe problems. I want to talk a little about that before I go on to deal with the broader issues.</p><p>I am lucky&#8212;if that is the right word&#8212;to live very close to the area that was affected by flooding in Stonehaven. Stonehaven has been affected by serious flooding on several occasions, but the first time it was badly affected was on the first Sunday in November 2009. As a result of very heavy rain in the Carron catchment area, the burn rose, it closed the gaps under the bridges and the water spilled out into the streets. Stonehaven had experienced floods before, but that was the first in modern times and was certainly the worst in living memory.</p><p>The effects of that flood were quite devastating on a significant number of businesses and homes near the foot of the new town, but particularly in the High Street area of the old town. Those who fought their way back from that disaster to reconstruct their homes and re-establish their businesses also experienced a significant effect on their future insurance premiums, which rose because the flooding risk was defined as greater.</p><p>That experience was made rather worse on 23 December 2012, when virtually the same kind of flooding happened again. I know that there are some disputes about how the water may have flowed and how it got to where it was, but we can say simply that, as with the incident three years earlier, the water fell out of the sky and it ended up 4 feet deep on the High Street of the old town.</p><p>That second incident had the effect of making some properties and businesses uninsurable. Over the past few days, I have taken the opportunity to speak to several individuals who have some experience of the effect of the flood. One lady told me that the excess on her home insurance for flooding purposes increased from &#163;250 prior to the two flooding incidents to &#163;5,000 today. One business in the old town now has insurance cover with an excess of &#163;25,000. Another business&#8212;a garage&#8212;simply cannot get insurance to cover it against the effects of flooding. Thus, the on-going impact of flooding can cause specific problems in certain areas such as Stonehaven, which serves to inform us about the issue.</p><p>In terms of the petition, my assessment is that there is a problem with the use of cross-subsidy, which is when insurance companies choose to charge a slightly higher premium across the board in order to cover for extreme eventualities. That may be a justifiable principle in many cases&#8212;after all, that is what insurance is about&#8212;but, as the petition points out, because of the difference in risk we in Scotland may be paying slightly over the odds for our insurance.</p><p>Sadly, the problems that the petition seeks to deal with do not include those of people who are already in an extremely difficult position in relation to insurance. That is why I welcome the fact that, in their opening remarks, both the mover of the motion and the minister took the opportunity to broaden out the debate to talk about the nature of risk and the requirement to ensure that risk is reduced.</p><p>The people who suffered two floods in a three-year period will, of course, take the view that something should have been done, but I welcome the fact that the current minister, Paul Wheelhouse, was quick to visit Stonehaven after the second flood, which was the first for which he had ministerial responsibility. I welcome the fact that he talked to people when they were still under the pressure of having been flooded only a couple of days before, and that he has continued to take a positive interest. There were delay and procrastination in the three years between the incidents, so it is essential that we do not experience those again, which is why I will continue to call on the minister to use the powers that are at his disposal to encourage progress to be made whenever possible.</p><p>What about those who suffered as a result of the increased insurance premiums and who will continue to do so? Whatever solution we find for the problems, it is essential that it delivers affordable insurance even for those who know that they are in at-risk areas. The old town of Stonehaven has a lot of older housing that has been effectively redeveloped and modernised. A number of small businesses in the area have become very resilient because they simply have to cope with recurring incidents. However, if we do not find a solution, the alternative could be that those areas of the town will be largely abandoned&#8212;the business will move out and the houses will perhaps remain empty. I do not want that to happen.</p><p>When I visited the High Street yesterday, it was full of vans belonging to workmen who were in the houses and business properties that are working to return the town to its former glory, to prepare for the tourist season, which we hope will be successful, and to ensure that everybody gets back into their houses at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>In spite of the minister&#8217;s little poke about our being better off independent, I will forgive him on this occasion because I believe that he is taking the correct approach. If we do the right thing and follow the right course of action, we can find a way to ensure that insurance is affordable across the board for those who require it and, more important, we can find a way to ensure that those who have been hit by flooding, and in some cases hit again, can get affordable insurance and can continue to plough their course against Scotland&#8217;s increasingly inclement elements.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, thank you very much for your generosity.

We have a grand example back in Stonehaven, where I was earlier. It is not that we are building on flood plains, since the flood area has been populated for many hundreds, in some cases perhaps even thousands, of years. The issue in Stonehaven concerns the decisions on planning applications around the town. If we build new roads and new roofs and surface over large areas in the immediate vicinity, that means, of course, that when it rains, the rain runs off a great deal more quickly and the likelihood of flash floods is much higher.</p><p>It could be argued that much of the development in the Stonehaven area has already contributed to a higher risk of flood in the bottom of the town, based entirely on the fact that when the rain falls on soft ground, it can take hours or days to reach the bottom of the river, but when rain falls on a hard surface and runs directly into a drain, it can be down there in minutes.

I wonder whether we might be justified in asking the minister to make a desktop case study of double-flooding events to see whether there are any lessons to learn that we have not previously learned. As a result of the evidence that we have heard, it seems that such incidents are much more common than I thought they were a couple of hours ago.</p><p>The main issue that I want to deal with is cross-subsidy or shared risk&#8212;both terms have been used today. In fact, we heard Angus MacDonald use the term &#8220;stealth subsidy&#8221; and say that Scottish people were paying insurance to support people south of the border. However, as I said earlier, the nature of insurance is sharing risk. Of course, we could debate endlessly the precise point at which shared risk stops and cross-subsidy starts&#8212;the two terms are synonymous.</p><p>By defining Scotland as a separate area, we could perhaps gain cheaper insurance against flood risk.

That is where the advice of those who work in the insurance industry is vital. This debate has brought up a subject that is much more complex than the simple issue of flood insurance, but that is what it has, essentially, been about. We know that there are people across Scotland today who might be paying higher premiums in order to support those who might need to be supported through their insurance. However, we also know that there are many people in Scotland who&#8212;by virtue of the fact that they have been flooded before&#8212;have been identified as a high risk and consequently are not enjoying an opportunity to share the risk with others.</p><p>Although I fully support the idea that we need to keep insurance premiums as low as they can be, within reason, and I fully accept that we do not wish insurance premiums to be restrictive, particularly on those who find them difficult to afford, we also need to be sure that we have an insurance industry that can cover its costs, can pay out claims when they are made and understands its responsibilities.

The opportunities of shale gas and coal-bed methane extraction have a chance of bringing success and wealth and of giving the technology and the companies that have shown the way in the north-east of Scotland and in the North Sea the opportunity to come to other parts of Scotland and bring wealth and know-how with them. The opportunity exists for us to take advantage of those new gas sources to underpin the new thermal capacity that John Swinney has spoken about during this debate.</p><p>Of course, we have to balance the fear and the facts.

That kind of affordability and economic growth is vital in Scotland, particularly in the areas where the new industry could be developed. Of course, there is a downside. There is apparently a fear of earthquakes.

It was a background of unethical and illegal conduct on the part of some sections of the press, alongside the long-overdue realisation of the fundamental failures of the existing regulatory regime.</p><p>The inquiry also took place against two broad propositions, accepted almost universally across the political spectrum. The first was that the status quo was not tenable and was not an option for the future. The second was that the answer to the question, &#8220;Who guards the guardians?&#8221; could not be, &#8220;No one.&#8221;</p><p>In the previous debate in Parliament on the Leveson recommendations, Ruth Davidson made it clear that we now have an opportunity not only to restore faith in the regulation of the press but to put the public interest back at the heart of everything that the press does. That is what the UK and Scottish Governments have been seeking to do over the past five months.</p><p>When the Conservatives in Westminster and the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood responded to the Leveson report&#8217;s recommendations, we made it clear&#8212;unlike some other parties&#8212;that statutory regulation of the press would not just be unwelcome but fundamentally threaten freedom of the press. The value of a free press to our society can hardly be overstated. It is part of the lifeblood of our democracy and is never something to be sacrificed or even imperilled lightly.</p><p>We also made it clear that, if we truly believe in a free press, it is not possible to force a solution on the industry. That is why we opposed a mandatory, statutory-based regulatory system and why we are unconvinced by the recommendations of the Scottish Government committee that was headed by Lord McCluskey.</p><p>Five months on from the publication of the Leveson report, we seem to be making at least some progress north and south of the border. With the support of all the main UK political parties, the UK Government has agreed and published a royal charter to implement the Leveson recommendations. The royal charter has benefited hugely from hundreds of hours of detailed negotiations with victim representatives, political parties and the press itself. It will provide for a regulatory system headed by an independent, self-regulatory body; an arbitration service for victims; speedy complaint-handling mechanisms; and the ability for regulatory bodies to levy fines on newspapers of up to &#163;1 million and require the publication of apologies.</p><p>Unlike what was in Labour&#8217;s initial plans, the royal charter will not be underpinned by statute, but there is a statutory clause that will require a two-thirds majority in Parliament to alter its content. In that sense, the proposed royal charter will guarantee even less risk of political meddling with the regulatory system.

As the Conservatives argued five months ago, a separate Scottish solution for a regulatory system is unnecessary and unworkable. It is unnecessary because newspapers here are well used to dealing with cross-jurisdictional differences in Scots and English law while nonetheless operating under a unified regulatory system. That is not an issue under the current system.</p><p>A separate Scottish solution is unworkable because it would mean the burden, as well as the cost, of two regulatory systems, and there is no appetite for that. In that respect, we welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s recognition of the unworkability of the McCluskey proposals. They are not practical, desirable or affordable.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has mentioned the Scottish Government&#8217;s suggested amendments to the UK Government&#8217;s proposed charter to ensure its full compliance with Scots law. Those are quite reasonable suggestions.</p><p>On the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposal with regard to the Watson case, that issue is, due to subsequent redrafting, adequately covered by the editors&#8217; code of conduct. Under clause 5, on intrusion into grief or shock, there is a requirement for publication to be &#8220;handled sensitively&#8221; when a deceased person is the subject of a story. Nonetheless, we remain open to more explicit mention of the treatment of the recently deceased in the code or in its accompanying handbook.</p><p>There are challenges ahead that cannot go without mention. Last week, the press industry published its own alternative royal charter. It seems that that move was not intended to thwart the negotiation process; rather, it was a symptom of the breakdown in communication between the press on the one hand and the UK Government, Opposition parties and other interest groups on the other.</p><p>There are a small number of practical differences between the industry and Government proposals. First, there is the issue of the code committee&#8217;s membership. Under the Government&#8217;s plans, serving editors and industry figures would be virtually excluded from appointment; under the industry proposals, serving editors would be excluded from the main adjudication bodies but they would have an input into the code committee.</p><p>The code of conduct, which was produced by serving editors and industry figures, was not criticised in Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s report. That was one area of the current regime that seemed to work well. It therefore seems reasonable that the industry, as well as those who use the code, should have a say in its drafting and content, without that undermining the Leveson principles.</p><p>Secondly, the industry&#8217;s proposal suggests an alternative pilot damages arbitration service on an &#8220;inexpensive&#8221; basis rather than the Government's proposed free counterpart. That seems to reflect the fact that the industry cannot sign up to a &#8220;free&#8221; arbitration service whose cost is wholly unknown. It would also ensure that titles that played no role in the crisis that led to the Leveson inquiry will not be unduly punished by paying heavily for the sins of others.</p><p>Much has been said in the debate, and it is reasonable to suppose that the motion will be agreed to.

Just to clarify, it is in effect a piece of independent research and should not be confused with a report that has been approved by the Welfare Reform Committee. I am prepared to accept the report as independent research that has been published, but I will question some of the terms that it contains.</p><p>I question the notion that the welfare reform process and the benefit changes will somehow take &#163;1.6 billion out of the Scottish economy. Perhaps that money will be taken out, but we must take account of the changes that have taken place in the round. In particular, the changes in the tax threshold&#8212;which will reach &#163;10,000 in April next year&#8212;will mean that many of Scotland&#8217;s working poor are substantially lifted out of tax. The net effect will be that many of those in work who lose a little in benefits will gain substantially in tax that they are not paying, but the report fails to recognise that key balance.</p><p>However, I find one or two things in the report particularly valuable. It makes it clear, for anyone who might have thought rather differently, that there is in fact no difference between how the changes affect Scotland and how they affect England. Those who might have wished to argue that the reforms disadvantage Scotland will have that particular fox shot from them by the report, which states:</p><p>&#8220;the scale of the loss in Scotland, measured per adult of working age, is broadly on a par with the GB average. Overall, the welfare reforms hit Scotland less than northern England or Wales, but more than ... southern England.&#8221;</p><p>That indicates to me that anyone who uses the notion that I described to argue for Scottish independence is constructing an argument that is not viable.</p><p>It is also useful to us that the report indicates that the change will be much more noticeable within Scotland rather than between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. It states:</p><p>&#8220;Within Scotland, however, the local authorities covering the poorest areas are hit hardest. As a general rule, the more deprived the local authority, the greater the financial hit.&#8221;</p><p>That indicates, as we all suspected, that the culture of welfare dependency that we have&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;to deal with in Scotland has a very strong geographical basis.</p><p>As we have listened to the debate progressing, several anomalies have arisen. The your say process in which the committee has engaged has, substantially, managed to find people who have had significant difficulties with the benefit system. However, the vast majority of those who have come forward are talking about issues that predate the introduction of the Government&#8217;s welfare reforms on 1 April this year. In fact, the irony is that many of the problems that those individuals have encountered have been a result of reforms in the benefits process that predate the current Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government altogether and were introduced by the previous Labour Government.</p><p>That brings us to the challenge. If we are to talk about welfare reform in the Scottish context, we cannot do so in a vacuum. We cannot have a situation in which those who oppose the progress in Scotland simply say, &#8220;We oppose change.&#8221; The fashion used to be to say that welfare reform is necessary but that it could be done differently, but in the debate so far&#8212;as in previous debates&#8212;no one has suggested how they might do it differently. Unless we are prepared to talk in those terms, we are making no progress in the debate.</p><p>Labour and the Scottish National Party are good at that approach, and they do it in different ways. Labour has one view in Scotland, but apparently it has a rather different view south of the border. I just happened to see Caroline Flint MP on &#8220;Question Time&#8221; last Thursday night. In an interesting discussion on benefits reform, she did not object to the benefits cap at all&#8212;in fact, her only objection was that it applied UK wide. She believed that the benefits cap should be much higher in London, where it is more expensive to live and consequently people need more money. That view is wholly inconsistent with the view alluded to by the Labour Party in Scotland. That is why we need the Labour Party in Scotland to tell us its view on such subjects and how that would apply.</p><p>Of course, it suits the Scottish National Party&#8217;s purpose to argue that benefit reform in Scotland is a bad thing and that the process would be different if Scotland was independent. We hear a lot of figures being bandied about. There is the cost of &#163;1.6 billion that is mentioned in the committee&#8217;s report. The figure could be &#163;2.5 billion or the &#163;4.5 billion that the cabinet secretary mentioned in her opening speech. The report makes it very clear that, if Scotland was ever to put that amount of money into benefits, it would be as a function of redistribution in the Scottish economy.</p><p>If that &#163;1.6 billion, &#163;2.5 billion or &#163;4.5 billion has to be found in Scotland, it must be found from areas of the economy that would do well to avoid that additional level of taxation. My challenge to the cabinet secretary is to explain to us, before the debate ends, exactly who will pay the tax to pay the benefits and exactly how much extra tax will have to be paid.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by saying a few words about the nature of the report.

Mr Miyaji&#8217;s mother and grandmother came originally from Dundee, and his grandmother latterly lived in Montrose.</p><p>That is perhaps apposite, given that it was a Scot, James Pender Mollison, who founded the first cricket club in Japan in 1868. Just five years earlier, in 1863, the first-ever cricket match in Japan was played between Yokohama merchants and the Royal Navy. Members will be interested to know that the players in the 1863 match went on to the field armed with revolvers&#8212;a practice that, I am pleased to say, has not survived in cricketing tradition. The current tour celebrates that important 150th anniversary.</p><p>More recently, cricket has flourished in Japan, where there are about 3,000 players and some university clubs, as well as junior and senior clubs. That brings us to the present day. In welcoming the teams from Japan, I highlight the charitable work of the Japan Cricket Association, which has found support across the world, including in Scotland. I am sure that we will hear more about that from Liz Smith later in the debate.</p><p>In March 2011, Japan was struck by an earthquake that measured 9.0 on the Richter scale, and the subsequent tsunami saw waves reach 6 miles inland. The effects on the northern part of the country were devastating; estimates of the numbers of dead or missing people reached 20,000, and the effects are still being felt today, as the country is rebuilt.</p><p>To assist with the recovery, the Japan Cricket Association has done excellent work through its charity Cricket for Smiles, which seeks to deliver cricket equipment and to offer cricket coaching to children, in the hope of bringing smiles back to those who experienced the catastrophic impact of the natural disaster. Given that many sporting arenas are still being used for temporary housing and that a vast quantity of sports equipment was lost, that work is making a significant contribution. In one area alone, more than 1,000 children have benefited from being introduced to a sport that can be played almost anywhere.</p><p>One of Mr Miyaji&#8217;s other objectives is to reach out and build links between communities, especially between those in Japan and the United Kingdom. I am sure that the playing of matches in London, Edinburgh, Stirling and Glasgow will achieve that objective; I am also sure that any member who wants to go along to any of the matches, especially those that are held in Scotland, would receive a warm welcome.</p><p>That takes me to the second part of my motion, which addresses the continuing links between Scotland and Japan. The year 2013 marks the 400th anniversary of the beginning of diplomatic, trading, scientific and cultural relations between Britain and Japan. When he wrote to King James in 1613, the retired shogun Tokugawa said:</p><p>&#8220;Though separated by ten thousand leagues of clouds and waves, our territories are, as it were, close to each other.&#8221;</p><p>In the intervening 400 years, some significant figures stand out in the relationship between our two countries. The best known of those is perhaps Thomas Blake Glover, who was known as the Scottish samurai. He was a son of Fraserburgh who had an immense impact on the industrialisation of Japan, including the introduction of the first steam locomotive, the construction of the first industrial slipway for ship repairs and the introduction of modern mining techniques. His home in Japan is now a museum that attracts more than 2 million visitors a year. In Scotland, he is remembered by the Scottish samurai award, which is presented annually by the National Karate Institute to those who have served Scotland nationally and internationally. Recipients of the award include Lord Charles Bruce, Sir Ian Wood and&#8212;would you believe&#8212;the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond.</p><p>In the same year as Japan saw its first cricket match, five young samurai who were known as the Choshu five were smuggled out of the country to be educated abroad. One of them, Yamao Yozo, lived in Glasgow and worked at Napier&#8217;s shipyard on the Clyde while studying at Anderson&#8217;s College. He later became an influential member of the Government of Japan and set up the Imperial College of Engineering. Incidentally, the same Yamao Yozo is believed to be behind the introduction of &#8220;Auld Lang Syne&#8221; to Japan, where even today it is sung at high school graduations and is played to signal the closing of public parks.</p><p>Over the years, many young Scots have travelled to live in Japan as part of the Japan exchange and teaching&#8212;JET&#8212;programme, which was devised to promote international understanding and to improve foreign language teaching in schools. Here in Scotland, countless thousands have been introduced to Japanese culture by taking up martial arts such as karate, aikido, kendo and judo. In fact, one of Scotland&#8217;s leading karate instructors, the Aberdeen-based Ronnie Watt, has been awarded the order of the rising sun by the emperor of Japan.</p><p>Educationally, the University of Edinburgh has an excellent Japanese department, which I know has taken an interest in this evening&#8217;s debate, and the University of Stirling recently hosted a Japanese week that included lectures, cultural events and a symposium.</p><p>I turn to trade. Japan has proved to be an important business partner for the United Kingdom. In Scotland we have 65 Japanese companies employing some 5,000 people across a range of sectors, with growing activity between Scotland and Japan in the field of renewable energy. In 2010, Scottish exports to Japan were valued at &#163;295 million. Scottish Development International has been promoting Scottish goods and produce such as salmon to great effect. In June this year, the UK Government will launch the export to Japan scheme, which will provide free information and multimedia and other resources for UK companies on the Japanese market. That will include information about business opportunities and previous successes by British companies and advice about the Japanese market and how to do business there.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689209", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Japanese National Cricket Teams"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Gichou, watashi wa, kitaru cricket nihon daihyou team no Scotland hohmon wo kangeisuru kono dohgi wo teishutsusuru koto wo, taihen ureshiku omoimasu.

I usually overcome that disadvantage by just disagreeing with everything that the minister has said. However, in this case I am unable to do that as I support the bill, and the Conservatives will vote in support of its general principles at stage 1.</p><p>It was interesting to go through the technicalities of the proposal, given that few of us, outside Government, thought much about the management of the new bridge when we were talking about its construction. I find myself fully supportive of the twin-bridge management strategy that the Government has adopted. Although I am aware that there are concerns over some issues, not least the state aid rules, I am able to say that I may have other reasons for supporting the strategy that the Government has adopted and, consequently, I maintain my support.</p><p>It is important that we use our road network efficiently. Change that allows us to take the Forth bridge away from the current arrangement under FETA, with the replacement crossing managed simply as part of our broader motorway network, gives us sound opportunities to manage our traffic in the future without some of the more difficult considerations that FETA occasionally led us towards. Some of us feel that it may deliver an advantage if, as is suggested, councillors are not directly represented on the new bridge management structure, given that council involvement in FETA led us at one point to a proposal for a &#163;4 toll on the bridge. That was before Parliament got together in one of its moments of unanimity and decided to abolish the tolls altogether.</p><p>As we look forward to the new structure, it is important to acknowledge the work that has been done to protect the staff who currently work for FETA. It is very important to ensure that there will be a straight move for those who are currently employed and that the TUPE process will ensure that their jobs and terms are protected. It is also important to acknowledge that the pension liability will be transferred for those current employees to, I believe, the new company and any successor&#8212;I see the minister nodding to confirm that. As a consequence, no one will lose their job or their rights as a direct result of the transfer. However, it gives us the opportunity to be more efficient in how we manage the bridge in the longer term.</p><p>One of the key issues that was raised a number of times&#8212;I admit that the minister clarified it for us consistently&#8212;was the worry that FETA might leave liabilities with the City of Edinburgh Council for which the council might be responsible in future. The minister has taken every opportunity to reassure both the committee and the council that that is not the case. The minister&#8217;s announcement that he has now given the council a formal assurance that the liabilities have been transferred to Transport Scotland will take away one of the key concerns that was raised repeatedly.</p><p>Another issue that was raised was that of encouraging the representation of the bridge management on organisations for national and international bridge management companies. Considering the difficulties that were experienced with the first Forth road crossing, it is important that those with expertise work closely together so that they can learn from one another&#8217;s experiences and understanding. In his closing remarks, the minister might be able to give us an assurance that simply transferring that responsibility to Transport Scotland will not take the connection one step away from those who are responsible for the day-to-day management of the bridge. I look forward to hearing that assurance.</p><p>The final issue that I want to address is the duration of the contract that is likely to be issued. I appreciate that a five-year contract with potential add-ons extending up to 10 years makes for a substantial contract that will attract interest and give the winner the opportunity to carry out their responsibilities properly and seriously. However, the suggestion that emerged in the evidence that there might be management cycles for the new structure extending to 15 years gives me cause for concern. I ask the minister to consider that issue during the rest of the bill&#8217;s passage to ensure that we do not undermine management&#8217;s confidence to get on and do work that is necessary.</p><p>That said, the Conservatives will support the bill at stage 1.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687687", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Usually, when I am called to speak third or fourth in these debates the difficulty is that everything has been said already.

If we were to listen to the line that he often repeats&#8212;&#8220;I told you so&#8221;&#8212;any criticism would fall away, but we need only look back to March 1999 to realise that Alex Salmond&#8217;s judgment in these matters is not always perfect. The SNP spectacularly failed to get it right on the international stage over the NATO intervention in Kosovo, when a bid to stop ethnic cleansing there came under significant criticism from Alex Salmond as a member of the House of Commons. In fact, he described that intervention as &#8220;unpardonable folly&#8221;. He was shown by events to be simply wrong.</p><p>It is obviously the case that the First Minister often cannot stop himself scoring cheap points at the expense of others. That approach degraded the debate. Furthermore, if we look back at the situation that arose in the lead-up to and during the Gulf wars, we realise that many decisions were made against a background that has not formed part of today&#8217;s discussion. Indeed, the support that was given to Iraq prior to the first Gulf war was very much against the background of that country having to defend itself desperately from a frantic invasion by its neighbour, Iran.</p><p>It is very difficult for us to take any decisions that are based on a single moment in time without taking into account the context. In fact, that context must be taken into account when we consider the issue of weapons of mass destruction. We now know that they did not exist in Iraq, but we also know that they had previously existed in that country. In addition, we know that, had the Iraqi Government chosen to co-operate with Hans Blix and his weapons inspectors, it could have proved its point. Unfortunately, it was not willing to make that change.</p><p>As I progress towards the end of my remarks, I believe that it would be inappropriate for me not to take the opportunity again to pay tribute on this 10th anniversary to the 179 members of the British armed forces and Ministry of Defence civilians who paid for the Iraq conflict with their lives.</p><p>This anniversary also provides us with a chance to look ahead to Iraq&#8217;s future. Significant challenges remain and terrorist attacks continue to kill innocent people today, among others. However, UK troops based in Iraq trained more than 22,000 policemen and 20,000 Iraqi soldiers between 2004 and 2009, which was done first as part of building up the 10th Iraqi army division in south-eastern Iraq and, after 2007, to train the 14th division in Basra. The UK troops have also worked closely with the Iraqi civilian authorities to develop Basra international airport, which now handles some 4,000 passengers a month.</p><p>I like to look to the future. I think that, having had this debate, we need to take the opportunity to look at our record in Iraq and treat it positively. We need to look to the future and ensure that we use our judgment wisely and any intervention carefully, but we should always consider that option.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686787", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Iraq Invasion (10th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, thank you.

In fact, my background as a rabid, running-dog capitalist dairy farmer in the 1980s and 1990s left me in a position where some of my views on food markets and their regulation may not be entirely popular with other members of the Parliament or of the farming industry. Let us brush over that, however, and start to consider where we are today and what we need to say about Scotland&#8217;s food production and the quality that it can provide.</p><p>As we have discovered, ministers come and go in the Parliament under various Governments but, amazingly, in the field of agriculture and environment, we have had only two ministers in the entire history of the Parliament. One was Ross Finnie, who quickly established a reputation for himself as someone who understood what was going on in the rural economy and the farming industry. Subsequently, following the change of Government, the arrival of Richard Lochhead delivered a young man with a certain past reputation, but one who was well able to establish himself as a spokesman for Scotland&#8217;s food and farming industry both at home and abroad.</p><p>It is important that we recognise the contribution that the Parliament has made and the responsible view that successive ministers, and indeed spokesmen from other parties, have taken in ensuring that we do all that we can to promote the food and farming industry to the best of our ability. However, that is occasionally challenged. The recent problem associated with the contamination of beef supplies with horsemeat has served to focus our industry. In this country, we have a tremendous record as exporters of high-quality food and produce. The minister mentioned the whisky industry, and I am now aware of a new fact: exports amount to 40 bottles a second, which is an extraordinary sum and is despite the fact that Jamie McGrigor and I are working as hard as we can to keep as much of it at home as possible.</p><p>The issue of how we exploit our produce should and does remain a concern at Government level and at party level. My party has had a number of eat local campaigns, not least the one that was sponsored by John Scott, the gentleman who is now occupying the chair, during his time as party spokesman on food and farming. He promoted the eat local campaign, on which we worked very hard. The Government has pursued similar projects, and the think local project is a key element of policy.</p><p>We must never forget&#8212;I remind certain members who have already spoken in the debate&#8212;that the global influence of Scottish food and produce is equally important. Scottish farmers currently enjoy a higher price for their product because it has a quality and a reputation, and it can therefore command a premium in international markets. Even in areas in which we do not sell directly into commodity markets across the world, prices for commodities such as grain are higher in Scotland today because of markets being influenced by countries such as China. The global commodity market, regardless of whether we sell into it, has a key role in determining high or reasonable prices for Scottish product.</p><p>That must be balanced against the need for affordability. Just a few days ago, a story appeared in the Aberdeen Press and Journal relating to information that had become available about the cost of preparing a school meal. I understand that Aberdeenshire Council disputes the figures that were used, but the suggestion was made that a school meal in Aberdeenshire costs &#163;1.68 to prepare and present. In this day and age, with prices as they are, I have serious concerns about how a meal can be prepared for &#163;1.68. I will pursue that matter with Aberdeenshire Council. The question remains: can it be done and can it be done legitimately? My concerns remain.</p><p>However, the issue of horsemeat and its inclusion in beef products in this country does not require us to take radical or excessive action in terms of regulation. I doubt that more regulation is required. Regulation is already very strong and has been very effective in keeping high-quality produce in the marketplace and on our supermarket shelves here in Scotland. The problem is not the regulation itself but the failure to enforce and police existing regulation properly.</p><p>The problem that we face with the horsemeat scandal is one of criminality, whereby produce has been moving across borders unregulated and included in products that have come to this country but which should have been properly policed in their country of origin or country of production. Therefore, the effective implementation of regulation is more important than simply throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p><p>It concerns me that in debates in the chamber opportunities continue to be taken to talk down the quality of Scottish produce and food. Sadly, I find it repetitive that the Green party seems to think that this is another opportunity to do that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686116", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a long time since I have spoken in a debate involving food and farming issues.

We will all remember that, back in the days before Scottish Water was created, the Scottish water industry&#8212;or, I should say, its constituent parts&#8212;was a bit of a basket case. The various parts of the industry were underinvested in, poorly resourced and, in some cases, not managed as well as they might otherwise have been. The creation of Scottish Water was therefore something of an inevitability. It was necessary for things to be gathered up, put in one place and pointed in the right direction.</p><p>Since the Scottish water industry became Scottish Water, things have come on in leaps and bounds. I will not criticise Scottish Water&#8217;s performance, which I believe to be extraordinary. Everyone concerned, from the management right down to those in the field and the contractors that work with the organisation, deserves to be praised for what they have achieved. They have made the Scottish water industry something that we can all be proud of. Now that Scottish Water has been place for 10 years and more, I believe that this legislation is necessary to ensure that the industry can change, develop and progress.</p><p>Although I think it essential to express my support for the industry, I believe that certain alternative structures could, if allowed, encourage it to develop more effectively.

We were keen to emphasise that we wanted the industry to be owned by its customers rather than by the Government.</p><p>With that little bit of fine tuning, I will progress to talk about one or two other key things that the bill brings to our attention.</p><p>As it is, Scottish Water has an amazing level of expertise, skill and talent. Much of the bill is about setting Scottish Water free from the dead hand of state control. In that respect, it does many of the things that Conservative members would wish to do, but it chooses a different model to achieve those objectives. Part 3 will have that specific effect as it will let Scottish Water do valuable things and work in partnerships that will allow it to progress the industry in Scotland. The minister claimed that water bills in Scotland are &#163;54 lower than those south of the border, of course, but the Government consistently fails to take into account the billions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money that have been invested. Unless we recover that money some day, that figure is an inaccurate representation.</p><p>In looking through the other parts of the bill, it is fascinating to see that a whole part of it&#8212;part 7&#8212;is devoted to the issue of water shortages. I come from a community that has been washed away on more than one occasion in the past two or three months, and I would love to experience a water shortage. I look forward to doing so in future. When the regulations are eventually implemented and ministers have to make pronouncements on water shortages, I will be out there with my deck chair enjoying the change in the weather that we will experience.</p><p>Part 4 has a key part to play in respect of raw water quality. I value the opportunity that it gives the industry to work hand in hand with other organisations and individuals to ensure that raw water is of the highest quality in Scotland.</p><p>Elaine Murray has already touched on part 6. In my postbag, the issues of private sewage works and septic tanks in particular are of a surprisingly high level of significance, and I value the opportunity to look at them afresh&#8212;perhaps that is the wrong word to use in relation to sewage. I hope that I will be able to give appropriate advice in a number of current cases and take forward the issue of septic tanks in a constructive, engaged and co-operative manner, because quite often that experience is not reflected when those issues are being dealt with.</p><p>Part 2 relates to water abstraction, in which I developed a peculiar interest during stage 1. My concern was that the issue had been added to the bill late and without adequate consultation, and that there was little or no explanation about why a number of provisions, although they were not wrong, had been included. That is why I lodged a series of amendments at stage 2 that would have removed part 2 completely. Unfortunately, those amendments were not supported, and I thought that I would not waste our time today by lodging them all again. However, I take the opportunity to express my concern again and, later in the debate, Mary Scanlon will go into some detail about our around part 2 and abstraction interests.</p><p>Had I been in a position to influence what is in the bill, I would have done things differently, but much of what is contained in it is worthy of support.

Improvements to the M8, the M73 and the M74 are now estimated to cost &#163;415 million, compared with a &#163;280 million estimate last year.</p><p>Those figures were announced after weeks of scrutiny from the Scottish Conservatives over why the Government had failed to deliver &#163;480 million of NPD construction projects in the past two years. Alex Salmond boasted that he would spend &#163;350 million in the current financial year, but just &#163;20 million has been spent. In the previous year, he boasted that he would spend &#163;150 million, but nothing was spent. When Ruth Davidson challenged him in the chamber to list the projects that NPD had achieved, he gave us a list of 20 projects, not one of which had been delivered.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s figures suggest that the failure to deliver the &#163;480 million of construction projects could already have cost Scotland tens of thousands of jobs. What was produced was not a progress report but a lack of progress report. We were given a list of schemes that are running over budget or behind schedule, followed by a new list of projects, with no detail on where the money would come from. The nationalist Government might think that announcing the new projects will act as a bribe to voters ahead of the separation referendum in 2014, but the Scottish people can see right through that.</p><p>It is bad enough that the Government has failed spectacularly on delivering its NPD schemes and has spent only &#163;20 million of the nearly &#163;500 million that was promised. Now we see a list of other projects that are running the same way.</p><p>We have heard time and again in the debate that the Government has suffered from capital reductions that have been passed on from the south, but we must take the opportunity to compare those capital cuts with the Scottish Government&#8217;s behaviour in relation to its own capital projects and its failure to deliver through NPD.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684424", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Capital Projects"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the cabinet secretary pointed out in her opening speech, earlier this month the Scottish Government published a so-called progress report on a range of infrastructure projects along with a wish list of new proposals for the coming decade.

As the availability of credit moved down the market, more and more people became used to the idea of borrowing to invest in their home or for things to put in it. As a result, the amount of domestic borrowing has regularly increased. However, the situation has got much worse in recent years because of the financial crisis, which has left more people in Scotland having to come to terms with dealing with debt. It is a serious problem that has left many households having to make tough decisions to keep up with repayments.</p><p>The debt arrangement scheme can be a great tool to help individuals who are struggling with debt to acknowledge the money that they owe and to allow them time to pay it off. It is undoubtedly a great scheme that has already helped many people to deal with their debt problems. The Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals to reform the debt arrangement scheme to allow the freezing of interest charges and the existing amount of debt from an earlier date are also extremely valuable.</p><p>I turn to the problems that are associated with payday loans. It is extraordinary that commercial loan companies lend money at astronomical rates that themselves are a major contributing factor to non-repayment and the consequent circumstances that the debt arrangement scheme was introduced to deal with. It would be valuable if we could find ways to limit the interest rates, but there are alternative approaches that should run in parallel. We should take the opportunity to ensure that the mainstream financial institutions can provide loans of a similar character but at more appropriate interest rates. I am ill-informed about but taken by the idea that credit unions should have an increased role. Perhaps surprisingly, I find myself supporting the Labour Party&#8217;s points about empowering credit unions in the long term so that they can have a greater role.</p><p>My amendment is designed to deal with a particular problem that came to the attention of someone in my office who was doing some research in advance of the debate. There appears to be a problem with cross-border recognition of the debt arrangement scheme. Many creditors are based south of the border and do not know how the scheme operates or even that it is available, which can result in issues for debtors and money advisers. Since the Accountant in Bankruptcy took over the administration of the debt arrangement scheme last year, that problem has reduced, but apparently it still exists. Therefore, it is important that Scotland&#8217;s two Governments work together to ensure wider knowledge of the scheme so that we do not have problems with understanding.</p><p>Another problem that has come to light, which again runs close to something that the Labour Party has talked about, relates to the role of the voluntary organisations that are, in effect, working to administer the debt arrangement scheme free of charge.</p><p>One such example is the CABx. One adviser from whom I sought information told me that the number of cases that she has had to deal with has nearly doubled, and the &#163;167,000 that the Scottish Government provides for second-tier training in that sector does not cover the work that goes on in places such as CABx. Although I am very reluctant to demand huge additional expenditure from the Government, I think that in this case a relatively small amount of money could go a very long way.</p><p>I would be delighted if, as a result of the debate and the widely held and supported positive views that have been expressed, the Government simply put in place a process to ensure that the debt arrangement scheme became an ever more effective way of dealing with an ever more dangerous problem.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-05586.2, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government to increase awareness of the Scottish Debt Arrangement Scheme with creditors based in the rest of the UK.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684051", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Debt Arrangement Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is my pleasure to speak in support of the motion in Fergus Ewing&#8217;s name and to move the amendment to it in my name.

As a result, the people who do need it find it hard to borrow money.</p><p>Like many members, I have a mortgage and a car loan. I pay the lenders back regularly as required and, because of that, I am a safe bet. Every day I get letters through the door in which companies want to lend me more money&#8212;money that I do not want. The money is so cheap that I should find a job for it.</p><p>Cheap money is available, but the problem is that the other side of the joke&#8212;it is not funny, I know&#8212;is that those who need money are the ones who cannot find it or who find themselves paying through the nose to get it. The truth is that those who need money and cannot afford it are the ones who are being exploited. That is a sad situation, which undermines the long-term viability of our economy. That is why, even though members hold many different economic and political attitudes about how the country should be run, there is an intense dislike of this exploitation. The desire to bring that to an end unites us all and will unite us in supporting the motion at 5 o&#8217;clock.</p><p>A number of issues have been raised in the debate that I should address at this stage because, in most cases, I agree with what other members have had to say.</p><p>Advertising was raised. It is important that more people know about what is available to them under the terms of the debt arrangement scheme, and what is likely to become more available as time goes on.

Sometimes I disagree with what is written in the Daily Record&#8212;in fact, I often disagree with what is written in the Daily Record&#8212;but it is wonderful that, as a campaigning newspaper with a tremendous record of working in the community with which it identifies, it has published that handbook. That is a sound example of what newspapers should be doing to ensure that their readers have the information that they require. I join the minister and others in the chamber in commending what it has done.</p><p>In the longer term, it will be necessary for the Government to support work on this by doing a little more than taking out a couple of adverts in a handbook. Consequently, it is vital that the Government consider how the information can be spread far and wide&#8212;even beyond the areas that the Daily Record can reach.</p><p>We have all come together in the debate and I look forward to voting for the motion at decision time. However, we must adopt key principles that go along with that desire. We need to find ways to cut demand for high-interest lending. We need to promote the availability of alternatives to it, but we also need to evolve the debt arrangement scheme to ensure that it fits need. That is what we are beginning to do today.</p><p>I look forward to supporting the motion, commend my amendment and look forward to the legislation that is to be introduced.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684051", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Debt Arrangement Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a serious subject, and it is not a debate in which there is really any place for levity, but I am reminded of an old joke that was used, in my day, to attack bankers, although it could be applied to any lender: there is a tendency among bankers to wish to lend money only to people who do not need it.

I have been aware of the issue for a while, but I learned more about it only yesterday when I, along with members of the Equal Opportunities Committee, visited a Travellers site at Clinterty, near Aberdeen. We had the opportunity to interact with a number of agencies and Travellers, followed by a full committee meeting in the afternoon.</p><p>As many members will know, there are quite a number of people in the Traveller community for whom the business model is, in effect, cold calling and who often offer property repairs, landscaping or gardening services.

For the Traveller community, that is the only available business model through which they can operate.</p><p>Although I am fully supportive of Dave Thomson&#8217;s proposals, I am concerned that simply outlawing cold calling for property repairs and similar services may drive legitimate Travellers who use that business model to the point at which they are no longer legitimate traders. That is why, if I am to support our going down this road, we must ensure that we apply some thought to how legitimate members of the Traveller community can be allowed to continue their business in some form but without cold calling. I am afraid that I have not had the time or the opportunity to come up with a formal proposal, but I would not wish to see those members of our community marginalised simply because their business method has&#8212;possibly quite rightly&#8212;been made illegal.</p><p>With that said, I redouble my support for the principles that lie behind the motion, and ask that we work together to find a way through the problem.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Property Maintenance and Repairs (Cold Calling)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Dave Thompson on bringing this issue to the Scottish Parliament for debate and I offer the apologies of Mary Scanlon, for whom I am a last-minute replacement.

I believe that it sees the need for welfare reform and that, while ministers condemn the UK Government for doing it, Nicola Sturgeon, quite rightly, is delighted that the UK Government is doing that job for her before&#8212;heaven forbid&#8212;she finds herself with her hands on the reins of power. However, that will not happen, and the reason is that the people of Scotland have already seen through that shallow position.</p><p>So far, the Scottish Government has used its politically motivated, synthetic outrage to whip up panic among benefits claimants. Today, realising that that has only alienated the hard-working families who pay the tax that funds the benefits, the Government has decided to go for the hearts and minds of the middle classes, who benefit most from child support. It is disingenuous to take that line because, for all Nicola Sturgeon&#8217;s hand wringing, it appears that not a penny is coming to the table. Promises are being made, yet there is no explanation of how they will be funded.</p><p>In the debate on the legislative consent motion, figures were brought to the chamber&#8212;they came from the Government&#8217;s back benches, in fact&#8212;that said that welfare reform would cost the Scottish economy &#163;600&#160;million and put 14,000 jobs at risk. That seems a huge amount of money and a lot of jobs. However, the claim betrays the bizarre assumption that the purpose of paying benefits is to provide economic activity. It completely misses the point that benefits are paid out of the money that comes directly from taxpayers, and the money is therefore drawn out of the economy in the first place. Alternatively, we could choose to borrow it, but I cannot understand how a Scottish Government could ultimately pay back that borrowing other than through increased taxation.</p><p>I believe that the pressure is on the Government to be honest about how it will achieve the objectives to which it vaguely, but regularly, refers. That is why, in the Minister for Housing and Welfare&#8217;s closing speech, I hope to hear exactly how the Government will finance its proposals. I want to hear&#8212;for the first time&#8212;costed commitments for how it will achieve the reversal of these welfare reforms. I want to hear costed estimates of how the vague promises to restore universal benefit will be funded.

We have already heard the minister address some of those measures.</p><p>The green deal and the energy company obligation will be the flagship policies for improving the energy efficiency of the nation&#8217;s housing stock. ECO and the green deal that will run alongside it will have the twin objectives of helping to reduce carbon emissions and tackling fuel poverty. ECO requires energy suppliers to help households to access more expensive insulation measures such as solid wall and hard-to-treat cavity wall insulation through the green deal, and to provide measures that will help low-income and vulnerable households to reduce the costs of staying warm and healthy. Through ECO, around &#163;540 million will be spent annually at a UK level, and we need to ensure that Scotland gets its fair share of that spending.</p><p>The community energy saving programme is targeted at the lowest 15 per cent of areas by income in Scotland and the lowest 10 per cent in England. The programme, which is designed to deliver comprehensive energy efficiency retrofits on a street-by-street basis, is expected to deliver permanent fuel bill savings of up to &#163;300 a year per household. By June 2012, 36 such schemes in Glasgow had been submitted to Ofgem for approval; unfortunately, I cannot provide an up-to-date figure. Under the super-priority group of the carbon emissions reduction target, some 600,000 low-income households across the UK will be helped. Again, we must ensure that Scotland benefits appropriately from that programme.</p><p>In addition, the Government will continue to provide pensioner households with the regular cold weather payments.</p><p>I turn to the position of the Scottish Government and its relationship with Westminster.

In our leisure time, we might use it to download a television programme that we have missed or a film that we would like to see, or perhaps to buy something that is not readily available on the high street.</p><p>However, for young people, the worldwide web is more than that; it is a virtual place. It is a space that they can spend time in and meet up with friends, in the same way as they can when they meet up in person. Research shows that children and young people do not differentiate a great deal between friendships online and friendships in person.</p><p>However, young people can be bullied in person, but can be equally vulnerable to bullying or other kinds of sinister behaviour online. In some respects, online bullying is worse. Previously, when a child came home from school and the front door closed behind him or her, they were safe from their tormentors. Now, bullying can continue in the form of cyber-bullying, which Scotland&#8217;s anti-bullying service, respectme, tells us was emerging as far back as 2007. Respectme also found that children and young people are online almost every day, with research from the Office of Communications showing that 91 per cent of children aged between five and 15 live in a household with internet access, with personal computer or laptop internet use at home running at 65 per cent of five to seven-year-olds.</p><p>Ofcom&#8217;s research also showed that parents have relatively low levels of concern about different aspects of their children&#8217;s internet use, with fewer than one third of those who were asked saying that they were &#8220;very concerned&#8221; or &#8220;fairly concerned&#8221; about their children giving personal details to inappropriate people and 27 per cent being concerned about cyber-bullying. However, the research by respectme showed that 16 per cent of the children or young people who were questioned said that they had been cyber-bullied and that 25 per cent of them worry about it.</p><p>Awareness of this important issue&#8212;which, as we know, can ultimately have tragic consequences&#8212;is growing, but awareness campaigns and media coverage are showing that there is no room for complacency. More must be done to ensure that parents who want to know where their children are and whom they meet when they go out also know the same things about their children when they go online.</p><p>Recently, I was delighted to meet Mr Jamie Tosh from Arbroath, whose daughter had been a victim of cyber-bullying. He decided that it was imperative that a safe online environment be provided for children who are too young to join other social networking sites, but who feel the need to do so in order to communicate with their peers. Mr Tosh&#8212;who is listening to the debate from the gallery&#8212;has invested a lot of his own time and money in such a site, which is called Kibooku, and I commend him for his hard work.</p><p>Kibooku is a social networking site that is aimed solely at children from the age of six and upwards. It is innovative in the way that it requires parental monitoring of their child&#8217;s activity at least every two weeks. Crucially, it also verifies the identity of the adult, thereby providing a strong disincentive to adults who might attempt to log in for inappropriate reasons. Members and staff will have the opportunity to gain first-hand experience of the site and an explanation of how it works in the middle of the day tomorrow, when Mr Tosh will be in Parliament to demonstrate it.</p><p>I believe that such innovations will ultimately play a substantial role in keeping our children and young people safe online, but we must all work together to help deliver the positive experiences that we want our young people to have. Of course, politicians have a role to play in that. Businesses, too, can and do contribute, but the internet is an exceptionally difficult place to police and it is vital that we encourage parents and responsible adults to engage positively with children and young people to keep them safe in the virtual world that is so important to them.</p><p>When we discuss issues in the chamber, it is quite common for us to ask questions to which we seek answers and to air problems for which we worry that there might never be solutions.

First, it surely demonstrates that the major contributory factor in the poor performance of the planning system is its chronic underfunding&#8212;even a 20 per cent increase in the fees would do little more than paper over the cracks. Secondly, if it costs so much more to administer than the funding allows, the extra money must be coming from other local authority budgets. The question that must therefore be asked is whether front-line services are under greater threat because the scant resources used to keep them going are topping up a system that is operating so slowly that it is threatening house construction levels and other important developments.</p><p>How long can we expect to wait for progress? We can expect the draft Scottish planning policy to be produced in the early part of this year, but that will simply lead to a consultation phase. We will have to wait until the end of the year before we have the proposed national planning framework. Until then, the system will grind on slowly, to the frustration of those obliged to engage with it&#8212;from the householder who wants to convert their loft, providing much-needed work for local tradesmen in the process, to the large companies that want to bring much-needed new homes to the market place, with all the employment and training opportunities that such developments would bring.</p><p>The Scottish Government must realise that this is not the time for paucity of ambition; it must take stock of the situation and act more decisively.

Nevertheless, a number of Government back benchers pointed out that policy decisions in that energy area lie with the Westminster Government. We have heard that many times before.

The truth is that the scale of the North Sea oil and gas industry and the oil service industry that has been built up around it in the north-east of Scotland is incalculable and not understood by a great many people, even from other parts of Scotland. We need to tell the world that the industry is buoyant and that, despite reduced production, it continues to grow substantially. The fact that the service industry now operates across the entire world to the extent that the economic value of that industry to Scotland is now almost 50 per cent generated outside the North Sea basin is a tribute to those who have developed businesses in the north-east of Scotland and to the expertise, knowledge and application of those who are involved in it.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, as we have heard, the industry is in terminal decline. It is our job, at this and every other level, to ensure that the decline is as slow and constructive as possible, while we continue to act as the base for a growing service industry that has the world as its market.</p><p>During the debate, we have occasionally centred too much on the idea that we need the resource that comes from the North Sea. Over time, as production falls, its value will increase to compensate. It is unfortunate that basic assumptions have been made in the debate that fail to take into account the options that the oil and gas industry has for the future. I do not agree with the idea that it is all about burning that resource. One or two members, including Stewart Stevenson, highlighted the fact that the resource that the industry produces has a value beyond that of simply burning it.</p><p>In developing a hydrogen economy for the future, it is inevitable that the North Sea oil and gas sector will be a source of raw material. We have talked about carbon capture and storage as a post-combustion option, but it is open to us to use carbon capture and storage as a pre-combustion option by producing hydrogen for another market. The technology to do that already exists and there are proposals to bring that forward. That is a transitional technology that will deliver against the green agenda that we heard about from Patrick Harvie.</p><p>As I said, we will support the Labour Party&#8217;s amendment. It is the nature of the Labour Party that some of its amendments sound a bit lefty in character, but I will not let that stand in the way, because its amendment today is accurate and true and deserves the Conservatives&#8217; support. We can be proud of the safety regime in the North Sea, although many lives have been lost in transport and in production. All members of the Parliament must highlight the need to support that regime.</p><p>I am significantly concerned about the requirement to expand the workforce in the North Sea. Many members have spoken about the fact that surprisingly few young Scots today see the oil and gas industry as their future employer. We need to get round that prejudice and ensure that, in future, there is more confidence.</p><p>We must also ensure that we do not just provide jobs for the young people of the north-east of Scotland, because Scotland has a requirement for high-quality jobs for people from other geographical areas. We should encourage people to take the opportunity to gain qualifications and move to the north-east to take up jobs. I do not support the idea that immigration to the north-east comes exclusively from outside Scotland or the UK. We need to encourage labour mobility within the marketplace and provide high-quality young Scots for the industry in future.</p><p>I will finish by talking about the political argument that a few members have mentioned and the idea that oil will become a key issue during the build-up to the 2014 referendum, although I do not want to say too much. That is inevitable, so we need to keep the process constructive. For that reason, at this point, I do not intend to go into too much detail on my position. However, as I travel between here and Aberdeen on the east coast main line trains, I often talk to men who are travelling back to their homes in places such as Newcastle, Middlesbrough and Sunderland. From the very bottom of my heart, I find it hard to understand how those in the south-west of Scotland can claim their justifiable right to benefit from the wealth of the North Sea, but can then say that the people of the north-east of England cannot do that.

It came as a surprise to many that abstraction was addressed in the bill and it remains a concern that a full consultation exercise did not take place. I fully accept the answer that ministers gave to the committee and that the cabinet secretary gave again in her opening speech that a dialogue continues with the industry.

We are determined to participate in the process of working towards a low-carbon Scotland. Although we had a number of serious concerns about the targets that were set in the bill, by voting for the bill we ultimately committed ourselves to that process.</p><p>That process has never been more vital. Although there are some among us, including within my own party, who are climate change sceptics, those of us who have ever tried to farm for a living&#8212;there are a few of us in the chamber&#8212;will realise that our climate is changing rapidly. Looking at the weather that we have experienced, we have seen radical change from one year to the next, with one year producing record rainfall after a previous year&#8217;s record cold winter. In fact, those cold winters may have put us on the slightly depressed note that we are on today, given that the emissions in 2010, from the domestic sector at least, were significantly higher as a result of the demand from ordinary people trying to heat their homes. When the figures are fully available, I hope that they will demonstrate that the milder winter of 2011 has put us close to at least getting back on track.</p><p>Like the previous speaker, I commend the work that is going on in our schools, and at every level in Scotland, to ensure that our young people can understand and work with the demands that will be put on them in the future. Having visited a number of eco-schools, I am well aware of the eco-schools programme, but I would particularly like to commend the work that is done with the primary schools in the Montrose area. Over a period of several years, at the beginning of each February I have been lucky enough to be invited to Montrose Academy to address the primary 7 pupils about the cross-party determination that exists in the Scottish Parliament to achieve the objectives that we have set out.</p><p>However, those objectives are not easy to achieve, and I continue to have a number of concerns about how we will achieve them in the current environment. It is only right that, as a developed nation, we should take the lead in demonstrating how those achievements can be made. However, with so many of the world&#8217;s biggest industrial countries outside the process, I worry that our objectives may not be achieved.</p><p>What can we do to ensure that we deal with these problems? I think that the Government needs to address some very difficult decisions. First, this country and others have demonstrated that gradually changing the fuel that we use from coal to gas has a significant part to play, perhaps not in the longer term, but certainly in the interim period when we need to try to cut the carbon cost of our energy.</p><p>That is why, at this difficult crossroads, the Governments in Scotland and the UK must make difficult decisions about novel gas extraction techniques that may allow us to make significant steps towards achieving our interim objectives, if not our long-term objectives.</p><p>I make no apologies for repeating something that I have said many times in the chamber: the figures that are to be achieved before 2050 are very demanding indeed. I find it difficult to reconcile the pursuit of those targets with the idea that we should close down our nuclear power stations and not replace them. The Scottish Government has missed an opportunity to ensure that our low-carbon energy production is achieved within the timescale that we want it to be by failing to use appropriate technologies in the long term.</p><p>I will say a few words about what the minister said about the Doha conference. First, I back up what he said. I am pleasantly surprised by the enthusiasm with which he spoke of the UK delegates at the conference. In fact, I am tempted to say that perhaps the union is safe in Paul Wheelhouse&#8217;s hands. [Interruption.] Perhaps not. Scotland should be proud of the international work that he described in Malawi and Zambia.</p><p>We have a great many challenges in front of us; we must address them systematically.

Nevertheless, we have the problem that, too often, we have allowed public opinion&#8212;sometimes manifested in political parties&#8217; policies&#8212;to be the judge of right and wrong in deciding how to exploit technologies that are available to us.</p><p>Some years ago, along with a young man by the name of Tommy Docherty who, at that time, worked for British Nuclear Fuels, I took the opportunity to participate in a number of university debates on the future of nuclear power&#8212;Tommy and I were always on the same side, as I am sure members will realise. Our experience was that, in the traditional and more arty universities, we got gubbed in the vote at the end of the debate. However, if we went to the new universities&#8212;the University of Strathclyde and Robert Gordon University&#8212;and there was a vote at the end of the debate, we won comfortably. That was because, in the new universities that encouraged technology and scientific education, there was a much broader view of that technology.</p><p>Today, we have a Government that is quite determined to ignore the opportunities that nuclear power offers this country on the basis of an understanding&#8212;or rather, a lack of understanding&#8212;of the science that, sadly, makes me worry for the future of technology in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679523", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of Science in Public Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I begin by offering my apologies to you and other members in the chamber for missing the opening speeches in the debate.

After the experiment, much of the grain was found to be dead, but some of it was able to be grown. Some of the seed that grew demonstrated characteristics that exceeded those of the parent crop.

Quite often, we in our different political parties have sought to deliberately misunderstand and sometimes misrepresent the arguments that have been put forward on our particular positions. However, I come to the chamber today specifically to talk about the issue of drinking and driving. Like the cabinet secretary, I believe that it is a scourge in this country. I am of a generation that comfortably believes that it is wholly unacceptable for a person to consume any alcohol if they intend to drive. For that reason, I believe that it is important, significant and welcome that the Scottish Government has brought forward a consultation on the matter and is considering legislating in the area.</p><p>I will endeavour to ensure that everyone in the chamber understands the point that I want to make so that they genuinely recognise what it is that the Conservatives seek in this debate.</p><p>If we look at the performance of the police in the past 10 years, there is a clear indication that the number of cases of drinking and driving is falling. I believe that that is due to the hard work of our police forces and our justice system, and it shows that hard work can pay off. I genuinely support the annual Christmas campaigns to discourage people from drink-driving. The fact that the numbers of people who are caught during those campaigns tend to rise and fall from one year to the next is likely to reflect the commitment and effort by individual police forces during Christmas periods rather than being a trend.

As I am a young man&#8212;in my mind I am still a slim 21-year-old&#8212;my plan was to look at it as something in the distant future. The problem, though, is that we need to think about these things earlier.</p><p>In my research I found the same fact that was used a moment ago. However, a figure was missed out previously, so I would like to read it out in full to demonstrate the full horror:</p><p>&#8220;Co-Housing was first created in Denmark in the 1970s, and around 8% of Danes aged over 50 now live in Co-Housing.&#8221;</p><p>That indicates to me that I am not as young as I thought I was and it is about time I started to think about these things.</p><p>We in this country like to do the best for our older people. Quite often, with the best of motives, we end up doing things that are not exactly what we set out to achieve. We work hard these days to keep older people in their own homes and in the communities in which they have traditionally lived. However, the problem with that is that in traditional housing, as they get older they become isolated. Many of our older people who do not suffer a particular disadvantage, either health-wise or in terms of access to the community around them, find themselves increasingly isolated simply by their increasing years. In fact, by doing the right thing we are sentencing many of our old people to an old age in solitary confinement.</p><p>That is why a principle such as co-housing could deliver so much more. If older people can work together and ensure that their needs are properly catered for without the necessity for continual, round-the-clock nursing or observation, it will enable them to maintain their independence. At the same time, as they get older, they can become dependent on each other. It ensures that their privacy and decorum can be maintained, yet they are never alone and never left without, at least, observation.</p><p>We need to recognise those changing needs. Like previous speakers, I am fully aware that the number of people in the older age groups will continue to rise dramatically in the years to come. Should I be lucky enough to live into my 70s or 80s, I expect to be part of a very much larger cohort than is the case today. For that reason, I genuinely believe that this opportunity to move forward with the Vivarium Trust&#8217;s proposal and to look at the pilot and its results will allow us to change our attitude towards housing for older people, to pool resources, to maintain the independence and sanctity of individuals in their old age, and to ensure that when I am older I will have a really interesting place to stay.

Those of us who have made a study of climate change and the science behind it will realise that the one thing that will happen as a result of global warming is not that Britain will get any warmer but that our weather will become even less predictable. Some people might suspect that attempting to predict the weather and to improve winter resilience is a losing battle in the long term, but it is our duty to do all that we can to ensure that every lesson is learned and that mistakes that have been made in one incident are not repeated in the next. That is why debates such as today&#8217;s are so valuable.</p><p>I want to cover a couple of issues, the first of which comes under the broad heading of transport. The worst experiences that I had during the winter period at the end of 2010 related to the unpredictability of rail services. I am well aware of why the rail services between here and my home in Stonehaven were as bad as they were&#8212;the weather was obviously the cause&#8212;but a serious problem at the time was the shortage of heated points on the east coast main line north of Edinburgh. Can the minister inform us whether more of the points on that route will be heated and will therefore not freeze as they did during that period?</p><p>My main problem with the rail system at the time was one that other members have highlighted&#8212;it was to do with the issue of information. The inaccuracy of the information about rail services that was available during that period was probably a bigger problem than the lack of rail services. My worst experience was one that I have told the chamber about before. When my wife phoned the national rail information line, she spoke to a very nice Indian lady who told her that there were no reported problems with rail services in Scotland, even though, as far as we could see, there were no trains at all running in Scotland that day. The importance of information can never be overstated. I am glad that the minister has already been able to say more about how information for travellers will be improved.</p><p>Another point about transport that I will make relates to roads&#8212;my amendment is about roads issues in particular. I share the concerns that are expressed in the Labour Party&#8217;s amendment about the danger that local authorities, for whatever reason, may have decided to save money on preparedness for the winter. I would like further reassurance from the minister that we do not have local authorities in Scotland that have failed to make adequate provision and that will be unable to provide the necessary support to keep roads open and clear of ice and snow should we suffer a bad period of snow and ice during the winter. It would be an extreme disappointment if the lessons of previous years have not been learned and if a single mild winter has been enough to encourage some councils to return to their old ways.</p><p>Another roads issue is the quality and maintenance of infrastructure. The lesson that I learned from 2010 was that many of the problems on our roads were associated with poor long-term maintenance. If there is a pothole and a man goes round to fill it with tar and roll it flat, the problem is that if there is snow, and it melts, and if a snowplough passes over the top of it, it is not long before the fill that was put in the pothole is thrown back out. I saw individual potholes in my own backyard filled and refilled on up to four occasions during the six-week period at the end of 2010. For that reason, we need to take a long-term approach and encourage local authorities to be as responsible as possible in dealing with that issue.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate and thank the minister for bringing forward&#8212;for the second time, I believe, after last year&#8217;s debate&#8212;a debate on winter resilience at the beginning of the winter, when we can talk about things in the cold light of day, without getting involved in the heated type of discussion that we had two years ago at the expense of a minister.

Jim Hume and Maureen Watt are correct when they talk about how important it is to find new and more imaginative ways of clearing roads, particularly in rural areas. We should be doing all that we can with the use of farm machinery. It is ironic that some of the roads that get the deepest snow and suffer most from winter conditions are in areas in which heavy plant might be sitting around in sheds doing nothing because of the snow. They might as well be out there clearing the roads, and we should continue to pursue that idea wherever we can.</p><p>I liked Brian Adam&#8217;s comparison with Italy, where scientists who were supposed to predict earthquakes recently received prison sentences for failing to do so. Not everyone would welcome the comparison with the failures of our weather forecasters or the potential threat of imprisonment, although I am sure that some might.</p><p>One of the key elements that has raised its head and been mentioned by a number of speakers during the debate is the cost of energy. Fuel poverty is a growing problem in Scotland, and we will discuss the reasons for that on other days. Today we have discussed the disastrous coincidence of increased fuel prices when we are going into what might well be another cold winter. James Dornan talked about the fact that several electricity companies in Scotland have given a commitment that there will be no winter disconnections, but my concern is about the potential for self-disconnection or denial by those who cannot afford to pay the bills and simply choose not to use the energy. It is essential that we all look at ways of cutting energy costs.</p><p>When energy costs are intrinsically high, and that is likely to continue, it is important for us to squeeze unnecessary costs out of the energy system. I therefore welcome the Prime Minister&#8217;s announcement in Westminster, however controversial the circumstances were, that demonstrated the Government&#8217;s intent that action will be taken to limit the increase in energy costs in future.

However, we have already seen that there are things to be said and I congratulate the Labour Party on having said some of them. I hope to say some of the other things that need to be said, although I will cover the same subjects.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I will ensure that I do not forget to move my amendment at the end of my speech.</p><p>The previous speaker need not be too worried, because the purpose of my amendment is not to introduce some alien concept that the Labour Party cannot bring itself to support. All that we want to do is to ensure that, as we go forward hand-in-hand with the priority of ensuring that we have more green buses, we take the opportunity of an increased marketplace to ensure that we can get value for money in the technology and begin to extend it over a wider range of operators and routes within Scotland. I do not have a solution to the problem, other than a faith that the marketplace will deliver as long as we deliver the on-going support that is necessary to ensure that that happens.</p><p>When I drafted my amendment, I thought that it might have been a step too far to introduce subjects such as the bus service operators grant. I am delighted that the Labour Party amendment has done so and I intend to address that issue and the issue of concessionary fares very briefly, in so far as they are related to the overall subject that we are discussing.</p><p>To return to the general subject, buses that have diesel engines are generally a fairly efficient way to transport people as long as we can persuade them to use the buses that are available. In terms of miles per gallon, they are probably still the most efficient way to move passengers. However, in terms of CO2, they are rather less so and worries are beginning to arise about the effect of diesel fumes in the environment.</p><p>As recently as this afternoon, during health and wellbeing portfolio questions, Graeme Dey raised the fact that the World Health Organization now believes that diesel fumes are a carcinogen. As a consequence, we have to worry about how we deal with that problem in the longer term. Hybrid buses&#8212;particularly those that use novel fuels&#8212;have the effect of taking away much of the pollution. I remember travelling round Aberdeen, some years ago, on a demonstration bus that was one of the first hybrid buses to be tested in Scotland. That day, it was powered by chip fat. Although the bus was extremely efficient, the smell resulted in me becoming very hungry before the trip was over.</p><p>We must start thinking about other changes in bus support and how they will affect the impact of the green bus fund. The BSOG and the concessionary fares scheme have been the basis of support for broader bus travel for some years. During the Scottish National Party Government&#8217;s time in office, it would appear that concessionary fares have been the highest priority. It could be argued that the BSOG has been squeezed to an extent to protect the value of concessionary fares.</p><p>Recently, changes have been made to the BSOG, for many of which I have expressed my support, in principle, in the chamber. The refocusing of the scheme means that operators are encouraged to go for fuel efficiency when they replace their vehicles. Consequently, hybrid vehicles such as those that are supported by the green bus fund, which we are discussing, are becoming more attractive&#8212;although, as has been pointed out, the fact that they have a significantly higher purchase price is still deterring some potential customers. The changes mean that there is a shortage of funding in many of our city areas because, in some cases, city bus routes have been disadvantaged. That is why Conservative members believe that consideration must be given to how the total value of the support that is provided for bus travel is focused in the future.</p><p>I have said before and I will say again&#8212;I will go on undaunted&#8212;that we believe that the concessionary fares scheme must be aligned with the pension age. I am not suggesting that we should take concessionary fares away from anyone. We can make the change year on year and ensure that no one who has the entitlement loses it. By targeting the concessionary fares resources on people of pension age, we might be able to extend the scheme to some other, equally deserving groups and to release some resources to go into the BSOG or the green bus fund, thereby ensuring that we achieve greater change.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When I first saw the motion I thought that the debate would be fairly anodyne.

If all the spare time is used up for back benchers, those of us who wind up unfortunately find ourselves with no extra time at all. However, today we have managed to manufacture the luxury of extra time. I had better not be frivolous and get on by saying what I was going to say.</p><p>I need to say a couple of specific things. First, it would be very remiss of me not to do as many members have done in the debate&#8212;but which I failed to do in my opening remarks&#8212;and say a few words about Alexander Dennis Ltd. Many members have more knowledge of the company than I do, and it has been mentioned many times. Elaine Murray initially pointed out that Alexander Dennis was at one time discussed in the chamber as a company that was in danger of not surviving. It is wonderful to be able to talk&#8212;as we have previously and are doing again today&#8212;about a company that has a world-leading product and is promoting it and selling it in Scotland, the UK and many countries around the world.</p><p>Our having a world leader, in Alexander Dennis, is something that we should be proud of. Too often, when we talk about the need to spend in specific areas in order to achieve Government or political objectives, we make the mistake of spending money in foreign factories. The existence of Alexander Dennis means that we do not have to take that tough decision. We can support green buses and expect many of the orders to be fulfilled right here, in Scotland. We should welcome that privilege.</p><p>I will move on to the debate, in which there have been a number of interesting speeches. It would be remiss of me not to address some of them. I did not quite hear the remark that Neil Findlay was making as I left the chamber briefly at one point, but he has nothing to worry about from me, as far as the Labour Party&#8217;s amendment goes. It will get my support, because it deserves it. The Conservatives will vote both for both amendments and for the Government motion, whether or not it is amended. This is not an subject on which we need party-political division.</p><p>I must get on and mention one or two other things from the debate. Not for the first time, Iain Gray used the opportunity to campaign for re-regulation of bus services. Without rehearsing the argument, I am afraid that I have to give him the news that he will find no support for that among Conservative members. However, he raised an issue that I want to address: he said that the primary purpose of the green bus fund is to deal with our climate change commitments. That may be a given for some people, but I am not entirely convinced that I believe it. I believe that the energy efficiency that modern hybrid buses provide and the clean air that energy efficiency generates in our cities are at least as important as the contribution that is made to Scotland&#8217;s climate change commitments.</p><p>Taking that a little further forward, some members referred to a thing that exists in certain circles: the climate change denier. We do not have many of those in the Parliament, and I make it clear that I am not one of them. However, when we talk about buses, we must not make the mistake of thinking that the green bus fund is simply part of a broader green policy, because it is much more than that. We need to consider the green bus fund as part of our support for bus transport in the round, and to see it within that group of priorities. That is why, when we look at the changes to the bus service operators grant, there is a great deal of synergy between the objectives of that redesigned scheme and the contribution that is made by the green bus fund.</p><p>I said previously in the debate&#8212;I will say it again&#8212;that we must consider bus support in the round and prioritise within it. It is vital that we have the courage to question the current rules that govern concessionary fares and that we retarget support for buses within the other measures that are available. By doing that, we may succeed in kick-starting and accelerating the green bus industry in Scotland, which will generate all the advantages of a growing industry within a growing market, and of an enthusiastic Government that targets limited support at achieving those key objectives.</p><p>There were one or two more light-hearted contributions to the debate. I have to remark on Marco Biagi&#8217;s concern about being compared to Stewart Stevenson; he threatened to take anybody who made that comparison outside. I do not know whether that was a threat of violence&#8212;perhaps we should not go into that&#8212;but I assure him that I will not do that.</p><p>We also heard at some length from Kevin Stewart about what is going on in Aberdeen. We heard not just about the existence of hybrid buses, although there are some there, but about the experiment&#8212;if I can call it that&#8212;with hydrogen fuel cell buses. That technology will perhaps come to fruition a few years down the road, but it can deliver a great deal, particularly for a Scotland that might find itself overburdened with wind turbines in the future. Perhaps on days when there is a little too much wind, as there has been in the past couple of days, we might use some of that surplus power to generate the hydrogen that will fuel that hydrogen economy.</p><p>I end with a comment on Patrick Harvie&#8217;s speech. He is always slightly out on a limb, but he introduces vital ideas to such debates. He talked about the need to ensure that bus lanes are used properly and effectively. I agree that they have an important part to play, but sometimes people see them as being an example of an authoritarian attitude from Government, whether local or national. As far as bus lanes are concerned, I would be delighted to see more of them, as long as we took a much more liberal attitude to who is allowed to use them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have got to the stage in the debate that usually leaves at a disadvantage those of us who make winding-up speeches.

The minister&#8217;s interview on the radio this morning was a good deal more enlightening than much of what has been said in recent press coverage. Keith Brown tells us consistently that we spend much more on rail services in Scotland than is spent in the rest of the UK. He told us that the Government plans to invest &#163;632 per capita in Scotland, compared to &#163;326 per capita in the rest of the UK. I congratulate him on that ambition, but it would be a good deal more consistent if he did not go on&#8212;as he did in that interview and as he has done at any other opportunity&#8212;to complain about the fact that the UK Government is causing him to scale back his plans.</p><p>The sad truth about the Government&#8217;s modus operandi is that, consistently, on a series of issues, it raises expectations, announces projects and bathes in the glory, then slashes the budget, dashes the hopes and blames the Tories. That scheme has now been repeated so often that surely the people of Scotland are beginning to see through it. The promises that were made for the Edinburgh to Glasgow railway genuinely raised expectations and hopes that the kind of economic development that is associated with rail projects might be extended across a much greater area and that Scotland&#8217;s economy as a whole would benefit.

That is based on the simple assumption that if an independent English Government decided to bring high-speed rail to its northern cities of Manchester or Leeds, it would be the job of an independent Scottish Government to consider how it might connect to that rail network.

I have to say that I was amazed to hear some of the contributions from SNP back benchers.

I can tell him that reality bites. The Government party&#8217;s back benchers have been wholly inconsistent in this debate. Some have backed the minister by suggesting that the cuts are Westminster cuts, some have gone to the opposite extreme and said that the project is turning out better than expected, while others have said that there is a squeeze on revenue budgets. Colin Beattie, in particular, suggested that since the work is being delivered in phases the money is actually being spent on other things in the meantime. The truth has come out in this debate.</p><p>Back in June, there was an opportunity for the minister to deliver the bad news about the project, but 13 days later it was announced in the press that the cuts would take place. The minister missed that opportunity and, in the view of many members, including me, showed a degree of disrespect to Parliament by failing to pass on that message and instead doing it so soon afterwards through the printed media.</p><p>In looking in greater detail at some of the claims that have been made, I say that Jamie Hepburn is absolutely right that even if the project was to be funded through the regulated asset base, that borrowing would result in a cost to service that borrowing, which would have an impact on the revenue budgets. However&#8212;tell me if I am wrong&#8212;interest on borrowing was not invented during the past year; it was possible for the Government to have guessed that it may have to pay for that borrowing. As far as I am aware, interest rates did not even go up in the intervening time. Once again, that was an example of this Government making a promise that it had no intention of keeping.</p><p>The Government has scaled back its ambition. It made promises that it broke, as Alex Salmond&#8217;s priorities changed and wandered. We have heard from so many members&#8212;most eloquently from Richard Simpson&#8212;about the impact of the changes on local plans and local development projects, which were predicated on the project going ahead and which had been announced a whole year previously. Across Scotland, there are plans that cannot be carried out because a promise made became a promise broken.</p><p>That is an example of what happens when a Government decides to buy popularity but has then to account for it. During the course of the debate, facts have been posited and questions have been put to the minister, but so far, we have heard very few answers. We have heard inconsistency in the excuses that have been given by the Government party back-bench speakers, and there has been a failure to deliver a true explanation for the decision-making process that, first, resulted in the decision and, secondly, resulted in its being announced in such a way that it could not be adequately questioned in Parliament at the time.

During the debate, several members have made clear that there was once a time&#8212;perhaps prior to 2007&#8212;when some unscrupulous practices may have gone on in an attempt to force up commercial rents. However, 2007 is a long time ago.</p><p>When properties become empty on our high streets, it is because no one wants them. Across Scotland, we will find empty properties that cannot be let. In fact, out of my own window in Stonehaven I can see a property that has been let for six months, empty for a year, let again for six months and then empty for another year. That is indicative of a market that is struggling to achieve what it wants to achieve, which is healthy, successful high streets. We are not achieving that because the people who are supposed to run the businesses are simply not there.</p><p>We believe that 5,500 commercial properties are empty in Scotland. As many members have pointed out during the debate, the bill has not a hope of filling all 5,500 empty commercial properties. How many of them will it fill? The minister cannot tell us. I suggest that even if the bill is marginally successful, it will be only extremely marginally so.</p><p>Let us consider what effect the bill might have on housing. The available research tells us that there are now more than 25,000 empty homes in Scotland. However, analysis of the figures suggests that among the chief offenders in keeping empty homes are councils themselves. A number of other organisations, including housing associations, find themselves in the same position. They have lists of tenants for whom they need to supply homes, but any additional cost for keeping empty homes is simply a cost for those who currently occupy property in the rented sector.</p><p>Let us also look at the issue that has not been raised during the debate, which is the hybrid area between housing and commercial property that is the private rental market. Over recent years, there has been a boom in buy to let that has survived the onset of the recession. In recent housing acts we have heard at great length how important it is that the private rented sector plays its role in housing Scotland&#8217;s homeless. The Government itself has acted on many occasions to encourage that to happen. However, if there are currently empty properties in that sector&#8212;I know that there are&#8212;the danger is that any imposition of additional costs may result in those who bought to let simply selling their property and taking it out of that marketplace.</p><p>I object to the fact that the Government had the option to take either the carrot or the stick approach in this situation but chose the stick. I think that it should have chosen the carrot. I suggest that the powers that are already available to local authorities when levying rates for empty properties are probably adequate and that the Government should have decided to take a positive approach and encourage people to do all that they can to make property available and attractive. This very day, Eric Pickles has been talking in the House of Commons about relaxing planning bureaucracy and restrictions that currently prevent many properties that are marginally habitable from being improved.</p><p>Here in Scotland, particularly perhaps in our wealthier areas, there are a large number of empty properties for which individuals find it difficult to get planning permission to develop. It is important that we have a system that is fit for purpose, so we need to address that.</p><p>A number of times during the debate there has been repetition of the line that the bill is only an enabling power that may not be used. I suggest that if the Government considers it unlikely that the bill&#8217;s powers will be used, it should think of doing something different. Why should we introduce more charges at a time when markets are weak? We should support those who find themselves in difficulties in order to get properties back into the marketplace.</p><p>My final comment is about something that Joan McAlpine said and it is very different from the rest of what I have said. We need to remember that those apparent enemies of ours who hold commercial property in our cities and are not putting it up for let are not faceless and unimportant. Many owners are small businessmen, and the faceless owners that Joan McAlpine described are the people who run our pension funds. For the good of the country in the long term, we need to ensure that investment in property remains attractive. The bill will make it less attractive.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671644", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Unoccupied Properties etc) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I will continue.

That is why, although the committee report is peppered with footnotes to indicate where I objected to specific conclusions, I join the other committee members in supporting the general principles of the bill.</p><p>In truth, it would be hard to find anything to object to in the bill, since the entire provisions fail to take up two sides of an A4 sheet of paper. The bill simply grants the powers to the Scottish Government that it would otherwise have had if it, along with its Labour allies, had not set out on an exercise of petty point scoring by denying the Westminster Government a minor part of its powers to act in Scotland. As such, the bill is no more than a fig leaf to cover the Government&#8217;s embarrassment.</p><p>In reality, however, there is a real problem, which was created by the Scottish Government but which nonetheless needs to be solved quickly&#8212;that is, the issue of passported benefits. Those include free school meals, blue badges, legal aid, the energy assistance package and a series of other important support measures that are provided by the Scottish Government or local authorities but for which entitlement is based on the claimant&#8217;s eligibility for one or more of the benefits that are about to be replaced.</p><p>One major change that will occur to the benefits system is the introduction of the universal credit from 2013, which will combine into a single payment jobseekers allowance, housing benefit, child credit, working tax credit, income support and employment support allowance. Then there is the personal independence payment, which will replace disability living allowance. A new assessment will be introduced that is intended to assess people more accurately and consistently to determine who will benefit most from additional support.</p><p>The purpose of the bill is to paper over that crack. It does not contain any direct measures; it simply empowers the Scottish Government to make orders to ensure that no one falls through the net. The details will appear in subordinate legislation, which will be introduced at a later date. As of today, neither I nor the Scottish Government have much idea of what that might contain.</p><p>Nevertheless, stage 1 consideration of the bill has provided an opportunity for stakeholders to express their concerns about the potential impacts of the changes. Representatives of housing associations have expressed their serious concern that the presumption against direct payments of housing benefit to landlords might result in financial difficulties for housing associations and anyone else who provides homes for benefit claimants. If payments are made directly to claimants, they might not use the money to pay the rent. However, how can we ever expect people to behave responsibly if we do not trust them to take responsibility for themselves and their families?</p><p>Another concern is about the assessments of claimants of the personal independence payment. There is ample evidence that attempts to focus the existing support on those who require it the most have resulted in an increase in the number of assessments, which has led to a series of complaints, as individuals feel that they have been called in for the same assessment more than once. The work capability assessment was introduced by the previous Labour Government and was always felt to be too mechanistic. That is why the current minister, Chris Grayling, invited Professor Malcolm Harrington, a leading occupational therapist, to review that assessment. His report, which was produced last October, flagged up several improvements that need to be made, all of which will be implemented in time for the first assessments to take place under the new arrangements.</p><p>There is a requirement for increased advice and assistance. On that, I agree fully with Jackie Baillie. Assistance must be made available to those who find themselves in difficulty during this period of change. I have visited citizens advice bureaux that are already experiencing elevated levels of demand. I am aware that local authorities and housing associations are bracing themselves for an increased demand on staff time. Additional resources have been allocated for that purpose in England and Wales, but we need to ensure that something happens in Scotland.</p><p>Our benefits system is supposed to be a safety net, yet it has failed some of the least well-off, who have fallen through it, while others have become entangled in the red tape. Few disagree that welfare reform is necessary. Today, we need the Scottish Government to give us not a prelude to a long stand-off, but a commitment to work together with the Westminster Government to make the process a success.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667406", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform (Further Provision) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Welfare reform is one of the issues of our time.

I and some of my Conservative predecessors have very different views from others on some aspects of home building and housing in the long term, but our fundamental commitment to the 2012 target has been unwavering.</p><p>I am delighted that the report has thrown up the fact that many of our local authorities are well on the way to achieving the target.

We all need to work hard to avoid that problem.</p><p>In the longer term, our objectives must be achieved by working together at every level. I repeat the comments that a number of members have made about common housing registers. Achieving the objective of having common housing registers across Scotland will ensure that we grasp as early as we can the opportunity to ensure that all social housing providers that receive funding from the public purse play their full part in ending homelessness. We should take no pride in the fact that some appear to avoid doing that. Social housing providers must work together with local authorities.</p><p>On the availability of housing, it is hard to escape in the report the point that we need more houses. I have criticised the Government for cutting its funding for the construction of social housing&#8212;the budget for which has dropped in recent years&#8212;and for its failure to broaden its attitude on including other funding.

That difficult situation needs to be highlighted today.</p><p>The critical importance of advice does not apply only to homelessness. It applies, of course, to the welfare reform process, which we are going through. Malcolm Chisholm pointed out that the Housing (Scotland) Act 2010 imposes a duty to provide advice on homelessness. It is important that we ensure that that advice is provided, and Margaret Burgess did well to highlight that situation.</p><p>Hanzala Malik&#8217;s contribution interested me.

In 1979, an 18-year period of Conservative Government began, and a few council houses were built&#8212;but not many. However, during that period housing associations came into existence. They were a massive step forward and are today one of the most important tools in the armoury of any Government that wants to provide new housing.</p><p>However, it was never illegal for councils to build houses.

I took the trouble to speak yesterday afternoon to Conservative candidates who are campaigning on the ground in Scotland&#8217;s major cities. It was brought home to me more clearly&#8212;if that was necessary&#8212;that a genuine problem is building up in our cities. It is a crisis that has been building up consistently for the past six months and it is more important to us today than it was when Labour first brought it to the chamber on 26 January.</p><p>The problem is that we have market failure in the bus service system. I am a fan of markets and will continue to defend the market approach whenever it can be used effectively. I believe that the deregulated market approach to bus services has a great deal to commend it&#8212;that was the case for the past, and it remains so for today and for the future. I do not regard markets as being about profit and loss; I see them as being about supply and demand. The market failure in the bus service system in Scotland at the moment is interfering with the relationship between supply and demand.</p><p>The cause of the problem is that the bus system&#8217;s biggest customer by some margin&#8212;and which is growing as a proportion&#8212;is the Government itself. Government decisions are having an increasingly disproportionate effect on how services are run.</p><p>I will consider the changes that have happened and how they are affecting us. Various changes have been made to the BSOG, which have had different effects. First, the overall cut in the grant has an effect across the whole bus industry. The causes of that are financial constraints, and the Government can of course blame London for that if it wishes. However, the reduction must be managed so that the pressure is spread more evenly. The decision to pursue a mileage-related payment rather than a fuel-related payment has positive elements, because it will encourage fuel efficiency and investment in fuel-efficient buses in the future. However, it also skews the balance of payments towards rural rather than city bus companies and city services are suffering as a result.</p><p>At the same time, the concessionary fares scheme is being increasingly underfunded. The result is that bus companies are doing two things. First, they are using fare payers to cross-subsidise the concessionary fares scheme; that will increase over time, which will force up prices. Secondly, decisions have to be made about which bus services might be cut, but the number of people travelling on the buses is influenced by the number who use the concessionary fares scheme. The consequence is that more buses might run during the day, which is when the concessionary travellers naturally wish to use them, but fewer buses will be available at key times of the day when people want to get to their work, college or whatever. That distortion is caused by the Government&#8217;s market decisions.</p><p>I want the Government to accept the constraints within which it operates and to realise that it has contributed massively to a short-term crisis. The reduction in total funding is part of that, but the Government must realise that what it is in control of and how it targets the available funding to support bus services are also critical factors. The Government must review how it invests that resource and consider whether it is appropriate to provide concessionary fares to people from the age of 60, many of whom are in work, and at the same time to use reductions in support to critical, economically important bus services in our major cities as a way of funding that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bus Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am afraid that I will not, because I have further points to make.

The Government is exploring with social landlords as part of its implementation work how that flexibility might come about.</p><p>Sadly, however, I am aware from advice that I have taken that there are issues surrounding housing law in Scotland that make some of the flexibilities that are possible in the south impossible in Scotland.

Nevertheless, to my surprise, it has been an exciting and diverse debate in which we have discussed the great principles of socialism and capitalism. I specifically mention that because Neil Findlay told us that libraries are the embodiment of the spirit of socialism. However, I did not have to interrupt him, because no sooner had he said that than Clare Adamson pointed out that Andrew Carnegie and the spirit of philanthropic, benevolent capitalism was what really delivered for the library system in Scotland.</p><p>We heard Mark Griffin take the debate into the area of &#8220;Oor Wullie&#8221;. It is an issue that has been raised several times and one that is close to my own heart, because for some 30 years-plus I have been married to a woman who is an expert on &#8220;Oor Wullie&#8221;. Perhaps it is necessary for us to employ the services of the National Library of Scotland to find out the answer to a question that she has delivered to me many times without any possibility of reply: what happened to Oor Wullie&#8217;s sister, who went out to play in 1943 and has never been seen or heard of again? Perhaps, if she is buried under the patio, &#8220;Oor Wullie&#8221; might yet find itself on the list of banned books.</p><p>I will go back to the subject that we are here to discuss. One of the interesting features that struck me in reading the committee report is that the existing board and governance structure have endured for more than 80 years. On the one hand, that suggests that it is necessary to update the arrangements given all the time that has passed, but on the other hand it confirms that there is a rich repository of experience. We should not be too quick to dismiss what we can learn from.</p><p>It is interesting to consider the bill&#8217;s two main aims, which are to modernise the National Library of Scotland&#8217;s governance arrangements and to set out its functions in statute. I do not think that anyone seriously disagrees that we need to do that, but I ask the minister to bear the two aims in mind when she responds to the debate.</p><p>On governance, the current structure is unwieldy. It is not suitable if we want an institution of the significance of the National Library to address all the challenges of the 21st century. A board of 32 members is indeed clunky. I think that all members, from our experience of sitting on external committees or boards of trustees, recognise the need for certain criteria to be met in relation to boards.</p><p>First, board members should bring genuine experience from a cross-section of backgrounds. The test should be whether each member is worth listening to because he or she adds to the knowledge and experience of the board. Secondly, board members should not be there to tick a particular sectoral box. Such an approach inevitably leads to limited individual vision and a lack of coherent strategic vision. Finally, the board must be large enough to cope with absences for reasons of illness or holidays, which are simply a fact of life. If it is not, meetings might not be quorate or, if they are quorate, the small number of members who are present might not be able to have a meaningful discussion. At worst, meetings have to be postponed.</p><p>In the original proposals there was a mismatch of principles. We welcome the spirit in which the cabinet secretary said that she will lodge amendments at stage 2. A board membership of as few as seven seems unsafe. The operation of the National Library of Scotland needs more stability than such an approach would afford. The weaknesses are obvious and seem to have been recognised after the cabinet secretary appeared before the committee. However, the unexpected inclusion in the bill of ministerial powers of direction accentuates the risk. I will talk about that in more detail shortly; suffice it to say for now that conferring such powers while allowing the board to be too small seems to be a highly undesirable combination.</p><p>We all agree that there is no magic or perfect number of board members. What has the experience of running the library for more than 80 years taught us? The evidence that the committee heard was helpful. The committee said in its report:</p><p>&#8220;There was unanimous agreement amongst the organisations that provided oral evidence that the proposed lower limit for the board was too small.&#8221;</p><p>It went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;the current chair of the NLS board ... considered that the ideal board size would be 12 or 13 members.&#8221;</p><p>I think that he is right.</p><p>When Scottish Government officials gave evidence, they said that the board could be bulked out by co-option. I do not agree but, if the cabinet secretary agrees, the National Library will have the Achilles&#8217; heel of a board that is too small for its purposes. The ability to co-opt gives a board the important flexibility to bring to the table a person who has particular experience or skill that will assist it in addressing whatever is confronting it at a particular time; it is not a way to make up numbers. I urge the cabinet secretary to listen to the evidence.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Library of Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Little did I think when I got up this morning that I would find myself speaking in a debate on the National Library of Scotland.

What do I take from the division in the results and the fact that those who voted by post appeared to vote one way and those who used alternatives means of voting&#8212;by phone or online&#8212;appeared to vote another way? I could suggest that those who voted by phone or online were more likely to be the younger participants in the ballot, and the result might therefore indicate that those who see their future in Aberdeen in the long term, who want greater employment and who want success and wealth to be created in the city are those who chose to vote for the project. That is as valid a claim as any that has been made by the Labour Party.</p><p>There have been previous consultations on the issue, in the form of opinion polls and an online ballot. The online ballot sparked a worldwide debate, with people with particular points of view intervening from the far corners of the earth. The online ballot opposed the project, but it was not limited to the people of Aberdeen. The referendum was, though&#8212;so much so that I, who live in Stonehaven, and many other people in Aberdeenshire, were disappointed that we did not get the chance to show our vociferous support. Within Aberdeen it was held and within Aberdeen it produced a majority. The minister quite rightly talked about that majority in terms that referred to the 1979 ballot on Scottish devolution, in which the majority that supported the proposition did not reach the 40 per cent mark that had been stipulated in the legislation. The irony is that it is the same Labour Party that supported that requirement that is now griping about the narrowness of the majority.</p><p>The vote was legitimate. It was, perhaps, experimental in some ways, but it produced a result that was, in my view, wide enough to be decisive.</p><p>There are other things that are novel in the project that have been criticised today, such as tax increment financing, which will, we hope, provide the project with &#163;92 million.

Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s work in bringing the matter to public attention has been welcome.</p><p>There was much in the consultation that was easy to oppose. Among the radical suggestions that were made were proposals to cut the sleeper service, the idea that we might be expected to stand for longer on trains and the suggestion that we might increase peak-time ticket prices simply to discourage people from travelling. Some of those suggestions were met with hysteria&#8212;I should know, because I led some of it. It is in the nature of a consultation that ideas are proposed that might be beyond the pale. It is up to us as politicians to focus our opposition on such ideas, and I believe that that is exactly what we have done.</p><p>Another responsibility that we have when consultations take place, as we have learned from bitter experience, is our duty as Opposition politicians to read between the lines and to interpret what might emerge from a consultation that is not obvious. I believe that that is what the Labour Party has done, and it is entirely appropriate for it to have taken such action.</p><p>It has been suggested by some&#8212;not least, the Labour Party&#8212;that we should never see a station close. I am not prepared to make that commitment, because I believe that, even during a period of expansion, the management of the rail network may require us to take tough decisions about individual stations. However, the idea that we might wreak havoc with the rail network, particularly in Glasgow, causes me serious concerns.</p><p>The reason for that is simple and fairly general: we in Scotland are not good at mass transit systems. Most of our cities lack the support that is necessary to get people into and out of the city centre effectively. We mostly rely on buses or cars. We had the bright idea of having a tram network in Edinburgh, but the concept of bringing trams into Edinburgh has been fraught with cost and practical difficulties. We should hold dear the idea that we have one city in Scotland that thought about transport in advance.</p><p>The Glasgow subway system is a precious jewel in Scotland&#8217;s crown, and we can ill afford not to give it proper investment and support in future. It is unacceptable to consider possible cuts to Glasgow&#8217;s suburban rail network.</p><p>Rationalisation is often used as an excuse for removing services. Scotland&#8217;s rail services, and those in Glasgow in particular, are seeing significantly increased footfall. Demand for those services has never been greater than in recent times, and they deserve our support.</p><p>I mentioned hysteria and my part in creating it, and such tactics are often used by Opposition parties. It is only natural that the Government should claim that it never had any such plan and therefore should not be attacked for the very suggestion that it did. Well, what I want to hear from this debate is very simple. At the end of today, I want to know that we have a clear commitment to the consultation process, a promise that no decisions have been taken already and an undertaking that no station will be closed. I also want a commitment that the rationalisation process will not be used simply to justify closures and a promise that what the minister says today will not change after the local government elections have passed. It is the cynical behaviour of politicians that discredits us in the eyes of&#8212;[Laughter.] I am glad that members are enjoying this. It is the cynical behaviour of politicians that discredits us in the eyes of the electorate. What the Government says today must stand up in the longer term.</p><p>It is essential that we look ahead and see the consultation for what it is, and that we get the Government to give us an undertaking that the consultation is not a Trojan horse for a closure programme that it will deny today but will implement in future.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661478", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail Services (Consultation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Richard Baker on lodging the motion.

In fact, I lodged an amendment only because I felt that one or two areas of the motion needed clarification and that I perhaps disagreed with the cabinet secretary on one area. I therefore took out a few cards from the pack, shuffled them and stuck them back in again, if members understand what I mean.</p><p>I want to go over those points quickly because there are other things that I want to say. First, as I think was highlighted by the previous speech, the Scottish Government and SNP back benchers tend to believe that the Scottish Government&#8217;s increased aspirations should be entirely funded by budgets coming from south of the border. If they are serious about independence, they need to realise that that situation cannot go on forever. Perhaps this issue is a good place in which to start realising that.</p><p>Another point that concerns me is that the motion states specifically that the Government</p><p>&#8220;calls on the private sector to work in partnership with the public sector to deliver open access future-proofed infrastructure and to support measures to increase take-up&#8221;.</p><p>I would like the cabinet secretary to clarify that that does not mean that the problem is that the private sector is not working with the public sector, but that he wants them both to work in partnership and is not suggesting that one is working harder than the other in that respect. I suggest that in some cases it is the public sector that needs to work harder on working with the private sector in order to deliver.</p><p>Another issue on which I would like clarification is 4G roll-out. The end of the motion refers to ensuring that</p><p>&#8220;the roll-out of 4G in Scotland at least matches the UK average.&#8221;</p><p>I wondered whether the cabinet secretary was talking about the coverage, the timescale or another aspect, because the motion does not state what he wants the average to cover.</p><p>My other points relate to the approach to market forces in the process. We are actually very lucky in Scotland. Many members have told us of their experience of difficulties with broadband and of constituents who have contacted them because of similar difficulties, but large areas of Scotland have a good broadband service that is improving quickly. The reason for that is that the market approach delivers in higher population areas. As a consequence, the broadband provider, which in practical terms in the Scottish context is BT, will invest because it will get a genuine return. It is important that we realise that the market has that role to play.</p><p>Of course, we have the problem in Scotland of a dispersed population and low-population geographical areas, which means that the market will fail in the roll-out.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22660613", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadband"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to speak in the debate.

The Government&#8217;s structure to support the roll-out of improved broadband services must be the mirror image of the market. The Government must ensure that it does not spend money where the market would deliver and that resources are targeted at areas where the cost of gain is highest. We need to achieve the reverse of market forces.</p><p>What do we need to do? The market teaches us much about structures. Over much of Scotland, the problem is that&#8212;regardless of what is done locally&#8212;we lack the fibre infrastructure and the backhaul capacity to support it. Even in some of our less-populated rural areas, we need bigger pipes and we must remember that, for wireless systems and 4G, the connection is only to the nearest mobile phone aerial, and it will be fibre that connects that aerial to the main system. We must target resource on reinforcing fibre capacity across as much of Scotland as possible.</p><p>I wanted to touch on the issue of 4G. It was said earlier that Britain was one of the first countries to roll out 3G and that we did so very effectively at the time. However, I think that we rushed it, with the result that large areas of Scotland, in particular, missed out on 3G. The area where I live is just 10 miles from Aberdeen, but it does not have 3G coverage&#8212;unless a person is willing to get into a rowing boat and row 2 miles offshore, in which case they will be able to get 3G from Aberdeen. That is not much use to me.</p><p>We have had a discussion, and we have had a suggestion from the cabinet secretary that I fully expected&#8212;that, if Scotland were independent, we would do the 4G roll-out better. If Scotland were independent, I suspect that the cabinet secretary would raise the percentage target for 4G coverage. However, as the target is raised, there comes a point at which the value of the spectrum in the marketplace gets to be zero, because the cost of provision is so high. There is a lot to be said for ensuring that targets in Scotland are as high as possible, but we do not want that to become a cost. Government should ensure that resource is made available to extend 4G in the areas in which it is unlikely to be economic to provide it; the Government should not find itself paying, because of lower resources from the marketplace, for 4G coverage across the board.

We are all getting older, but that is how it goes.</p><p>I suspect that many of the same arguments will be rehearsed today, but of course in the intervening time things have moved on. As has been said, the Conservative Party is quite proud of its record of deregulating bus services in the 1980s. Scotland has a great deal to be proud of in what has happened since then, not least that as a result of the deregulation two of the world&#8217;s largest transport companies evolved in Scotland: one in Perth and one in Aberdeen. We should never forget that a proper regulatory environment is absolutely essential to the development of good business in the future.</p><p>However, we are here to talk about the services that those companies and others provide right here in Scotland. Since the previous parliamentary debate on the subject, there has been plenty of evidence that bus companies continue to invest in higher-quality and more comfortable buses, that they are achieving greater fuel efficiency and that a great deal has been done to improve access for those who find difficulty in accessing public transport. For example, there are buses that can be lowered to allow people to get access. We should do more of that kind of thing, and the evidence is that that is happening.</p><p>During the debate so far, we have heard about the changes that are being made to the bus service operators grant. Having read the objectives that have been set out for that grant, I continue to be open-minded and believe that there is evidence that the changes will be positive, particularly in ensuring that we get greater fuel efficiency in our bus fleets and better value for money from the Government.</p><p>However, one or two things have not changed since the debate three and a half years ago. It seems to me that we see the differences in a party&#8217;s position when it is in opposition compared with when it is in government. The Labour Party, while it was in government, was keen to avoid the regulation of buses, while the SNP was keen to regulate; now, we find that the Labour Opposition wants more regulation and the SNP Government is resisting the calls to move towards a stiffer regulatory environment.</p><p>The truth is that flexibility generates good bus services.

However, by using that expression, I am leaping from metaphor to clich&#233; in a single bound, and let us not go there.</p><p>The speech that we heard just a moment ago was perhaps the best of the debate&#8212;although I believe that Patrick Harvie had his tongue very much in his cheek when he suggested that &#8220;Let&#8217;s go shopping&#8221; may be the basis of future economic development. Many an economist appears to have taken that view in recent years, but I still do not believe that we can build our entire economy on retail&#8212;although retail is very important for many of our cities. During the debate, we have heard a great deal about what is good in our cities, and many of us have found a great deal on which we can agree. The published document is very much something on which we can all&#8212;with the possible exception of Patrick Harvie&#8212;agree. The future of Scotland relies on the success of its cities&#8212;cities that are very different in both scale and potential.</p><p>I am lucky enough to represent North East Scotland, a region that contains two of our larger cities. Dundee is an example of a city that has had to work hard for many years. It has delivered a great deal of success through its research and its education and it has demonstrated achievements in life sciences and in the programming industry, which we have heard a great deal about. In recent years, miracles have been achieved with the regeneration of more than one part of the city&#8212;and I am thinking in particular about the waterfront. I pay particular tribute to Joe FitzPatrick. During his time in the Scottish Parliament, he has become an outspoken advocate for the city of Dundee, although he now finds himself with a little bit of competition, as Jenny Marra is on the same ground. It is good that the city has people who are willing to step up and defend its interests.</p><p>When it comes to defending the interests of a particular city, we have some competition in the form of Kevin Stewart, who has become an outspoken advocate for the city of Aberdeen&#8212;and, yes, there is a great deal to advocate about the city of Aberdeen. In comparison with Dundee, Aberdeen has, over the past 30 years, found itself in the right place at the right time. Not every city can be as lucky as that. Aberdeen has demonstrated a great deal of what other cities should be trying to achieve. We can consider the achievements of the Aberdeen city and shire economic forum&#8212;as the cabinet secretary suggested it was called. It has actually changed its name slightly, just to confuse us all. It is now Aberdeen city and shire economic future. The acronym is exactly the same, but it now means something different, which we had better take into account. It has achieved an enormous amount by bringing together people in the private sector and by making progress with initiatives that benefit that whole city region in the north-east.</p><p>I also commend the work of Nestrans, of which Kevin Stewart was once the chairman. Nestrans has demonstrated the importance of local authorities working together to strengthen transport links within a city region. Transport partnerships in other parts of the country have operated with varying degrees of success, and Nestrans has been an example of how things can be done correctly.</p><p>If we look again at that Aberdeen model, however, there are other things that we need to take into account. Earlier, we heard Jackson Carlaw say that what will deliver the strategy is our people, and that interference is not always the best or most beneficial approach for Government to take. Aberdeen has demonstrated in recent years the kind of altruism and support on the part of the successful businessmen of the area that, a generation or two ago, was the hallmark of other major cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, when fortunes were being made there. Aberdeen has been the city where money has been made and Sir Ian Wood came forward to offer substantial amounts of money to the city&#8212;for example, &#163;50 million for the development of Union Terrace gardens. It is horrifying that a small number of people have been able to stir up as much negative publicity as they have and have tried to prevent Aberdeen from enjoying benefits similar to those achieved in other places at other times.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659255", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agenda for Cities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before Patrick Harvie&#8217;s contribution, I was tempted to say that the debate had largely been about motherhood and apple pie.

The plan is so long term in its objectives that it is difficult to cost and difficult to work out what can be achieved within it.</p><p>The six strategic priorities set out by the Government are ones on which I think we can all agree. Maintaining and developing a supportive business environment are crucial to the long-term future of Scotland&#8217;s economy. Driving the transition to a low-carbon economy is a justified objective, whether one takes the green point of view or whether one simply accepts that oil and gas will not last for ever, in which case a low-carbon economy becomes a necessity. Supporting learning, skills and wellbeing is also a very valuable objective to pursue, as is the strengthening of communities through infrastructure and development. Maintaining effective government and ensuring equity are also important. Those objectives have been set out in a plan that I propose to look at point by point to try, in the limited time available to me, to work out exactly what we are trying to achieve here.</p><p>On transport, the Scottish Government plans to</p><p>&#8220;have dualled the A9 between Perth and Inverness&#8221;</p><p>by 2025 and completed</p><p>&#8220;the dualled road network between all our cities by 2030&#8221;.</p><p>However, as we heard from John Lamont earlier, where is the A1 in the plan? As Elaine Murray said, where is the A75? I found the answer given to John Lamont quite intriguing. If the completion of the dualling of the A1 from Edinburgh to the border is on the list of projects that are likely to cost less than &#163;20 million, perhaps the minister has discovered a funding mechanism to which we should all be paying rather more attention. I doubt whether it is on that list.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657655", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Infrastructure Investment Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Governments are often accused of being relatively short term and it is in the nature of politics that short-term decisions are the priority of the day.

My experience leads me to think that plant and human diseases will be a problem in Scotland as the climate warms up. Graeme Dey gave us the benefit of his words and made the point that some of the world&#8217;s richest countries still do not get it. That is a message that must be delivered at the conference in Durban.</p><p>The key issue that I take from the debate is that there is still broad hostility to carbon trading and the opportunities that it might bring. I agree with all members who spoke on the subject that it would be entirely inappropriate if countries such as Scotland used carbon trading mechanisms to avoid making the commitments that we should be making. The carbon units that were discussed in the Parliament earlier this week could represent exactly that kind of move and we need to be careful not to go down that road.</p><p>However, there is a broader argument, which I want the minister to address, if possible. As we all know, Scotland is capable of exceeding average performance in making progress against emissions reduction targets. We could do better than many similar countries. Scotland is lucky enough to have much of Europe&#8217;s coastline and the opportunity to use wind, wave and perhaps tidal energy in future.</p><p>If Scotland has the ability to exceed its targets and outperform the average, it is important that we use that opportunity. There are countries out there that will find it much more difficult to achieve the targets and which will perform below average. If Scotland could meet part of their targets for them, that will achieve the average performance that needs to be achieved. A carbon trading mechanism is one of the measures that could be used to ensure that those who can do, and that those who cannot get someone else to do it for them. There is an economic opportunity for Scotland in that regard, which we cannot afford to ignore. Other mechanisms could achieve the same objective, but carbon trading could undoubtedly contribute, if it were set up in the right way.</p><p>I spoke earlier in the debate and I do not intend to speak at great length in summing up. This has been a vital debate. It has allowed many members who have participated in such debates in the past to restate some of our priorities and to bring forward new ideas; it has also allowed a new generation of members of the Scottish Parliament to enter the debate and offer constructive and positive suggestions. In that respect, if nothing else, the afternoon has been valuably spent.</p><p>The Durban conference is on the horizon and it is important that we take the opportunity to send the minister off with the good will of the whole Parliament, as we have done on many other occasions.

The communities of mixed tenure that it created are among the safest, most sustainable communities that we have in Scotland.

In many parts of the country, if it were not for the market in ex-council houses, it would be impossible for people to make the jump from the private rented sector into home ownership. That vital stepping stone is essential to many young potential home owners.</p><p>However, the concept of the right to buy has been the subject of political prejudice in the Parliament for many years.

I do not know the specific circumstances and I do not wish to raise them. It is the concept that I will address today.

For a start, although there are people in Scotland&#8217;s public sector who understand the priority and will be able to target resources to achieve those objectives, others&#8212;some at senior level in our local authorities, health boards and other public bodies&#8212;got where they are today through managing their silos effectively.

From my experience of such debates, I find it quite ironic that when the Government has the presence of mind to have the debate in advance of the bad weather, the debate is relatively quiet and civilised, whereas if it had taken the trouble to get it wrong and have the debate after the bad weather, it would have been much more exciting. However, it is positive that we are having the debate in advance.</p><p>The thought occurred to me that every time we get a period of bad weather in Scotland, a director of some senior football club appears on television to demand a winter break in the football season. My thought is always, &#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea&#8212;just tell us when the bad weather is going to come and we&#8217;ll have a break.&#8221; In Scotland, the problem is that we do not always get bad winters but when we do get them, they can last a long time and there is no way of knowing that they are coming.</p><p>Last year, the snow first fell in the north-east at the beginning of the last week of November and did not start to melt until well into the first week of January. Not only did the towns and cities have a serious problem, but away from the coast the snow lay continually over that period, so we had to deal with some serious problems. Gil Paterson remarked that the snow lasted three weeks where he was. He and I had different experiences of the snow.</p><p>The real problems that we faced during the long period of bad weather were to do with the transport of both people and goods. At the time, my concern was that we were beginning to hear stories of supermarkets running out of products and the shelves being empty, and we came close to a situation in which we could have had serious shortages. The just-in-time principle of supply, which our main retailers and others have adopted, makes us more susceptible to that. Therefore, I take the opportunity to pay particular tribute to Scotland&#8217;s HGV drivers. Some people held them responsible for the blockages on our motorways, but they cannot stop. They continued to provide a service, often suffering the hardships of being trapped on the road, and their work averted a potential crisis.</p><p>I will go on to some of the other comments. Chic Brodie seemed to suggest that some of us were exaggerating the problems that we had with ScotRail. I have discussed my specific problems with ScotRail and I can assure members that where I get on and off the trains, at Stonehaven, there were no trains at all for long periods. As my colleague Jackson Carlaw pointed out, the problem was not just the lack of trains but the serious lack of information. Much of the information that was available through the traditional means, such as the internet and the national rail hotline, was simply inaccurate. At one point, in despair, my wife&#8212;trying to get rid of me, I think&#8212;phoned the national rail hotline and was told by a very nice Indian lady that there was no reported disruption on the Scottish rail network. That is an example of the problems that we faced.</p><p>Anne McTaggart referred to Facebook and Twitter as ways of getting information. I can tell members that, on one occasion during the snow period last year, I travelled to Edinburgh on a train that did not exist. It had already been cancelled, but word came out of Aberdeen station via Facebook that an east coast main line train, which was frozen solid and had no toilets or other facilities, was travelling south because it had to be somewhere else and the staff had decided to allow passengers on to it if they turned up at the station. I was at the station in time for the train to arrive and travelled to Edinburgh on the non-existent train. That indicates the importance of having information when it is available.</p><p>As Jackson Carlaw said, there was a failure of both infrastructure and communication, which affected not only passengers such as me but the then minister. Stewart Stevenson was forced to resign largely, I believe, because of his &#8220;Newsnight&#8221; appearance when he gave inaccurate information. I do not believe for a minute that Stewart Stevenson intended to mislead; I believe that he did not have the information that he should have had. Therefore, not only were passengers affected by misinformation; the problem went right to the top. I hope that Keith Brown is now in a position to guarantee that he will not be misled and that, as a result, he will not mislead Scotland&#8217;s travelling public if bad weather returns.</p><p>We are in a country where the weather is difficult to predict, but I will defend weather forecasters because their record shows that weather forecasting over a period of one to six days has never been as accurate as it is today. We need to use the information that they give us more effectively and understand it better. We need the organisations responsible for disseminating that information to interpret it accurately and effectively. As Jackson Carlaw said, once the same piece of misinformation has appeared on the motorway gantry for three days, it does not matter what it says. Nobody will believe it.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is always interesting to have a debate on a subject such as winter resilience.

We have seen the problems that are associated with energy suppliers making what appear sometimes to be arbitrary increases in their charges. Of course, Government action is happening both north and south of the border in an attempt to persuade companies to keep their energy prices down. However, I remind the minister that his own Government is pursuing a long-term energy policy that seems to keep its priorities in relation to energy supply at the top end of the cost range, rather than at the bottom. Wind power and carbon capture and storage do not come cheap and, consequently, they could add to fuel costs, over time.</p><p>However, that is not the cause of the fuel costs that we have today. Energy prices are high, which has unfortunately coincided with a period when wages tend to be depressed. The specific problem is that, as a result of flatlining wage settlements and increasing fuel costs, a large number of people who were not defined as being fuel poor in the relatively recent past are being drawn into fuel poverty. Worse still, many of those people do not realise that they are already, or are about to become, fuel poor. The Government has a responsibility to ensure that we take the opportunity to advertise the fact that difficulties are being experienced, because many people out there will be suffering as a result of the changes and will be unaware that there are options for them to receive Government support.</p><p>I believe that there is a particular problem in the private rented sector, which quite often is the housing supply of necessity for many of the people who are about to be affected by fuel poverty, particularly those in the harder-to-heat rural environment, where we know that costs are likely to be higher.</p><p>My concern in this debate is to highlight the fact that there is a group out there who have not been fuel poor in the past but who realise that their energy costs are becomingly cripplingly high and who will fall into the category of being fuel poor in the future. We need to take all the schemes that we have discussed in the debate&#8212;and will continue to discuss&#8212;and all the opportunities to assist that have been discussed in previous debates and focus them on a new group who do not realise that they were fuel poor but who are, I am afraid, becoming so.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653173", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jenny Marra on bringing the issue for debate.

I welcome the opportunity that is provided by the Government&#8217;s debate to do that. Unfortunately, though, housing is an area in which the Government has left itself open to criticism. A look at the figures indicates that housing has been targeted for a significantly reduced budget in years to come.</p><p>Excluding the separate allocations for Edinburgh and Glasgow, this year&#8217;s housing figure of &#163;268.5 million falls to &#163;155 million next year and &#163;133 million the following year, which represents a 40 per cent cut between this year and next.</p><p>Within the local government settlement, &#163;250 million has been allocated over three years. That is an average of &#163;83 million compared with the figure for 2011-12, which is &#163;98 million. The &#163;98 million this year was allocated to the councils in Edinburgh and Glasgow, but housing minister Keith Brown says that he wants to talk to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Association of Local Authority Chief Housing Officers about how the &#163;250 million can be distributed across Scotland.</p><p>The picture is unclear. The total housing supply funding figure of &#163;238 million for 2012-13&#8212;assuming &#163;83 million within the local government settlement&#8212;means that, overall, housing supply funding has been cut by one third on the &#163;368 million figure for this year.</p><p>Jim Strang, chair of the Chartered Institute of Housing Scotland, said:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government says that the funding will enable it to meet its 6,000 homes per year target.

We need to ensure that rents are affordable and not just for benefit claimants.

If I were mischievous, I am sure that I could name a number of bold steps that Germany has taken. However, we need only look into the relatively recent history, and decisions that Germany has made with its currency, for example, to see that it is a country that is big and wealthy enough to make bold decisions. When the chickens come home to roost and neighbours such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland hit economic disaster, Germany has all the money and can continue to hold all the values while those around it experience the difficulties.</p><p>Germany is one of those European countries that has relied heavily on nuclear energy over a significant number of years. Its decision to phase out its nuclear plants by 2022, which is more than 10 years away, is radical and one that it is fully entitled to make. However, the truth is that its decision will be based largely on the fact that it is able to source nuclear-generated electricity from its neighbours in France indefinitely into the future.</p><p>We in Scotland are in exactly the same position. On our capacity to regenerate renewable energy, we need only look back as recently as the last six weeks of 2010 to realise that there can be a catastrophic failure of the elements on which we rely to generate that power. Recently published figures for total production of renewable energy from Scotland for the whole of 2010 indicate that, in spite of the fact that there were very large increases in capacity, the amount of electricity generated fell. That should be a lesson to us all.</p><p>The truth is that we here in Scotland can afford to make the commitments that this Government has made to the renewable energy industry and our dependence on it in the future only because we know that we have a near neighbour that can work as a partner by buying that energy when we have a surplus to sell and supplying us, through the grid, with nuclear-generated electricity on days when the wind does not blow. As we discovered last year, those days come and they come for long periods.</p><p>I will close by saying a few words about our nuclear industry. In Hunterston and Torness we have two of the most efficient nuclear plants in this country, which have been run safely and efficiently for a large number of years. The staff at those plants are extremely professional and we as an economy have been able to rely on them for a long time. The decision of this Government to rely on those plants and allow their management to seek extensions of their lifespan is commendable, but it could be said to be hypocritical.</p><p>We have an exceptionally high-quality nuclear industry in this country and our Scottish plants are an example of that. When they close, as unfortunately they will, Scotland will not be free of its reliance on nuclear energy&#8212;no more than Germany will be free of its in 2022.

I raised the subject merely because the minister raised it.</p><p>The Conservative Party is aware of the need for cross-party working on the CFP, which is why we will vote for the Government&#8217;s motion whether or not it is amended. However, we will also support the Labour Party amendment. As we pointed out, that amendment is virtually identical to the one that was proposed by my colleague Alex Fergusson, which was not selected for debate&#8212;understandably so, in the circumstances.</p><p>The reason why we will vote for the motion and amendment is that we have grave concerns about the future of the industry. If we look at the relationship between the scientific evidence and the decisions that politicians make, we see that scientists and politicians, with the best interests at heart, far too often find themselves in diverging positions. The science can often be used to prove more than one thing and, when the politicians have become involved over the years, the micromanagement of the science and of the industry has resulted in many decisions being made for the best possible reasons but without delivering the results that the Scottish industry requires.</p><p>The proposal to move towards a system of maximum sustainable yields has its attractions but, as we know, the problem with the science in the past has been a failure to apply general principles in a way that produces significant improvements for the industry. For instance, the failure to understand the cannibalistic habits of the white-fish population in its immature phase meant that the failure to get the 1999 year class of haddock out of the sea more quickly than we did was a contributing factor to the population diminishing again over time.</p><p>We need to take a more holistic approach and treat the science with respect, but decisions need to be taken for the good of the industry by politicians who understand it. That is why the proposal to move towards regionalisation&#8212;devolution of decision making&#8212;within the common fisheries policy is important. Even if we accept the principle of common access to a common resource, there are people within the EU whose interests are not those of the fishermen in the marginal areas on the periphery of north-west Europe. That describes many people who rely on our fishery for their incomes. We must have the authority to do what is right for them, and it breaks my heart that the European green paper that was published more than 10 years ago and originally proposed a move to a regional management structure was so watered down by the time that it was enacted that all we got was regional management committees. We need to go back to that green paper and try to achieve the objective that it set out.</p><p>One key area of discussion in the debate has been discards. We all understand the Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall approach, which is that there should be no discards. Maria Damanaki appears to have taken up that approach with a vengeance, but the many members present who understand the industry know that it is not universally achievable.</p><p>I suppose that it would be possible to ban discards entirely if we regulated, but the problem is that we could create a market in the fish that were previously discarded and we do not want that to happen. The last thing that we want is for the industry to become based on its waste. We want higher-value catches to be sold at high values. Although we must do everything we can to reduce discards, the idea that they can be prevented entirely is not a good thing for the industry.</p><p>We have to think about how the proposals on the transfer of fishing concessions will impact on our industry. Members will be aware that I defend free trade whenever I can, and I will continue to do so, but the idea that fishing concessions might be traded internationally on a one-to-one basis or between member states is undesirable for an industry in Scotland that must not be allowed to sink below critical mass. As we have heard from other speakers, our fishing industry has been successfully managed down in size, and its catching potential has been reduced and largely matched to the availability of fish. If we now enter into an EU-wide arrangement that continues to exert downward pressure on our industry, we will be in danger of losing it. We cannot afford to take that step, so there must be protection to ensure that the fishing quota that is in Scotland today stays in Scotland wherever possible.</p><p>There are several reasons why it might be beneficial for aquaculture to be brought under the umbrella of the CFP. I do not intend to go through those ideas, because I intend to introduce as much of an air of caution as I can. Scotland is one of the few European nations that engage in the salmon industry specifically. There are other types of aquaculture in other parts of Europe, and the idea that they can all be drawn together and regulated singly under one umbrella organisation is dangerous. I suggest that the evidence is in what has happened with the CFP.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is not what we are discussing.

There is the need to ensure that when we flick the switch the lights come on. It is not as simple as it sounds. It means that when people go to their work in the morning they have to be sure that there is power to run the factory or whatever.

It is difficult to have an informed debate when many of us saw the paperwork only minutes before the debate started. There has been a degree of passion but, at the outset, we heard from the minister who, as usual, told us how good a job he was doing in dealing with the difficult financial settlement that he had been given.</p><p>The situation that we are in is much broader than what happens here in this Parliament. We have played the blame game today. The Government has blamed the Conservatives because we are the Government south of the border; the Conservatives have blamed the Labour Party because it used to be the Government south of the border; and, I am glad to say, everybody blamed the Liberal Democrats, not because it is really their fault but because it is fun. [Laughter.] I hope that they enjoyed that opportunity.</p><p>We have had a situation in which decisions that are made in London are having an impact on the money that is spent in Edinburgh. For those who consider the international position, the reason for that should be clear. Many countries made decisions about borrowing and expenditure that were far more generous, let us say, than the decisions that George Osborne made when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer. While Britain teeters on the edge, we have a degree of stability, whereas countries such as Ireland, Greece, Italy and, most recently, the United States have had to review their policy and make further cuts to their expenditure to achieve the objectives that have been achieved more gently and carefully by the current Government in the south.</p><p>I have said in the past that John Swinney is lucky in that he has acquired a reputation for being a responsible finance minister largely as a result of the financial constraints that the Westminster Government has placed on him. As we have seen time and again, the impression is clearly given that, if the money was available, he would spend more of it&#8212;and he does not tell us exactly how much he would spend.</p><p>My first question is for John Swinney and for Richard Baker on the Labour front bench, as both made the same comment that the cuts are too far and too fast. I have heard that before, but the question that I ask today&#8212;I would like an answer if possible&#8212;is this: if the cuts are too far and too fast, how far and fast should they be?

A number of things in the Scottish economy could be done much better. Anyone who was present at the Federation of Master Builders reception in the garden lobby last night will realise that members of that association had one or two complaints about a number of things that are happening at the grass roots in relation to capital expenditure. In fact, I suggest that the minister might want to discuss the matter with Fergus Ewing as I am sure that the voices of one or two of last night&#8217;s attendees are still ringing in his ears. They are concerned by the fact that it is increasingly difficult to become involved in the process of constructing or spending capital investment in Scotland.</p><p>The issues that particularly concerned those attendees are the lack of flow of money through the Scottish Futures Trust, which is still restricting them, and the fact that the procurement processes are beginning to make it very difficult for smaller local companies to become involved. The pre-qualification process, which was put in place some years ago supposedly to make it easier for such companies to become involved in capital projects, has put a series of hoops and hurdles in front of the companies, meaning that it costs considerable amounts of money to achieve pre-qualification. At the other end of the process, it is increasingly the case that larger companies&#8212;in some cases international companies and often companies that are not Scottish at all&#8212;are achieving the contracts.</p><p>The result is that, in order to squeeze the last few pennies of profit out of the hands of the construction companies, the jobs are being delivered to companies that are not operating in the Scottish economy until they receive the contracts. That is beginning to undermine the confidence of many of our smaller construction companies, and anecdotal evidence of bankruptcies and companies that claim that they are operating at a loss to achieve contracts are examples of what we need to deal with if we are genuinely to see an explosion in private sector employment in Scotland.</p><p>Before I complete the process of supporting Gavin Brown&#8217;s amendment, I want to touch on the issue of tourism. Between January and April this year&#8212;and I admit that these figures are anecdotal&#8212;domestic tourism in Scotland was down by almost 11 per cent and international tourism fell by more than 35 per cent. Despite the best efforts of companies in the tourism sector, it is instructive to note that when the Scottish Government gets involved&#8212;as in the gathering, for example&#8212;local businesses are left counting the cost.

It is an issue on which I agree once more with the position taken by the Government and it concerns the infrastructural developments that are required in the north-east, in particular the Aberdeen western peripheral route. That project is an essential part of the economic development of the north-east and the whole of Scotland. It will help to create the additional jobs that will be available as part of the region&#8217;s economic expansion. However, the project is being held back at the moment by a group that is&#8212;I believe&#8212;maliciously pursuing legal action to the last possible degree in order to prevent a development that is universally popular outwith the tiny minority who believe, largely for environmental reasons, that the project should be stopped. We need to do all that we can to ensure that the road is built as soon as possible, thereby cutting the cost to the public purse, locally and nationally. I encourage the Government to take any action that it can to ensure that the process is shortened.</p><p>Another thing that appeared in the First Minister&#8217;s statement yesterday was a commitment to a bill on agricultural holdings to</p><p>&#8220;encourage landlords to increase the availability of farming tenancies and support new blood to enter farming.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 7 September 2011; c 1373.]</p><p>Unfortunately, that is a road that we have trod many times. Parliament has tried to sort out that problem but has failed to do so. The most recent occasion was a long process, including extremely long negotiations through the NFU Scotland. The process resulted in an agreement about what we wanted to achieve, but by the time it emerged at the end of the parliamentary process, we had legislation that did not do what it set out to achieve.</p><p>In order to get more land available for new tenancies in farming, we must strike a balance between giving confidence to the farming industry to invest in tenanted farming arrangements and giving confidence to landowners to make land available. Every attempt that we have had so far has failed to strike that balance. On this occasion, the Government must take the opportunity to provide landowners with the necessary guarantees that will give them the confidence to make land available in years to come. That will be the test of the success of the legislation. If the Government makes the same compromises as its predecessor, the outcome will not provide new land for new entrants to the farming industry.</p><p>Housing had a remarkably short mention in the First Minister&#8217;s statement; so short, in fact, that it is hardly worth mentioning. Although &#163;400 million has been allocated to housing, I take the view that that is little in the way of new money; it is just a rehash of previous announcements and money that had already been committed. The Government&#8217;s record on housing is a disgrace. Private sector house building is less than half of what it was in 2007-08 and private sector starts are at their lowest level for more than 30 years. Given the SNP Government&#8217;s failure to finance housing association construction adequately, it is little wonder that that area has had a significant cut.</p><p>The flagship policy of having a national housing trust is faltering, having failed to win the confidence of the vast majority of local authorities and of the private sector. That leaves the housing minister pinning his hopes on councils removing empty home discounts on council tax. However, the devil is in the detail. If we look at the sums, we see that if all local authorities scrap all discounts, &#163;30 million could be raised.

In the spirit of end-of-term co-operation, we will also be voting for the Government&#8217;s motion, whether it is amended or not. It is important that we send out a strong signal that there is unity on the need to improve digital connectivity, in rural Scotland in particular.</p><p>I will begin by reminiscing about the period a few years ago when issues around mobile phones formed a significant part of an MSP&#8217;s mailbag. There were two main complaints: one was that someone was trying to build a mobile phone aerial near the person&#8217;s house and they wanted it stopped immediately; the other was that there were not nearly enough mobile phone aerials and connections were difficult.</p><p>The extension of the mobile phone system, especially into rural areas, and the opportunity to provide 3G in the near future and&#8212;ideally&#8212;4G in the longer term will go a long way towards solving many of the current problems with the limitations of wired systems. Experiments in Scotland have demonstrated that wireless systems can operate effectively in places where laying of cable is prohibitively expensive or geographically impossible.</p><p>I want to make it clear that mobile phones are an important element before I talk about the more significant element, which is the extension of broadband across a larger area of Scotland. No one underestimates the importance of a high-quality broadband service in the modern rural environment. Anyone who has moved to the country from a city only to find that the high-speed service that they previously enjoyed has been replaced with speeds that they have not experienced since the days of dial-up, and any farmer who is required to fill in forms and submit information online at speeds that mean that the exercise takes hours, will know exactly what I mean. For most people, high-speed broadband is as vital as mains electricity or indoor plumbing, so it is unfortunate that many parts of Scotland are operating in the previous century in that regard.</p><p>The United Kingdom Government has made it clear that the whole country should be able to share in the benefits of broadband and that it is determined to make that happen by the end of the parliamentary session. That is why it is investing more than &#163;500&#160;million to ensure that superfast broadband is available to everyone&#8212;&#8220;everyone&#8221; should be in inverted commas, because its meaning varies depending on the nature of the discussion, as members have said.</p><p>It is anticipated that the broadband industry will, on commercial grounds, provide the service to around two thirds of the country, but the Government thinks that it is essential that the whole country share in the benefits of high-speed access, so it has allocated &#163;530&#160;million to bring superfast broadband to the remaining third of UK homes and businesses, which would otherwise miss out. The Government&#8217;s ambition is to create the best broadband network in Europe by 2015, providing everyone in the UK with access to broadband speeds of at least 2 megabits&#8212;I found out the difference between bits and bytes today&#8212;with superfast broadband being available to 90 per cent of the population. However, I am the first to acknowledge that a 2 megabit service, although it is like gold dust for many rural customers, is well below the average that is achieved in our towns and cities.</p><p>In the UK Government, the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt MP, is responsible for making that happen. He has said that the Government is committed to the implementation of superfast broadband across the UK and is in discussion with the Scottish Government on how it should go about that in Scotland. It is anticipated that the UK Government will announce specific provisions for Scotland this month or next month.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, who opened the debate, gave the Scottish Government&#8217;s position at last week&#8217;s meeting of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, when he said:</p><p>&#8220;to underpin economic development in the coming years we must rise to the challenge of connecting rural Scotland to the world through high-speed broadband&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 22 June 2011; c 27.]</p><p>I agree that we must address the challenge.</p><p>In advance of the Scottish election this year, the Conservatives costed the objective at &#163;135&#160;million of investment over the parliamentary session to supplement the expected investment by the UK Government and the private sector. The aim was to focus expenditure in a way that would maximise economic and social return on investment in areas in which other investment was unlikely. The Scottish Government took a slightly different approach and said in its manifesto:</p><p>&#8220;We will ensure fair access to the digital revolution with a &#163;50&#160;million digital connectivity initiative, called the Next Generation Digital Fund, with the aim of accelerating the roll out of superfast broadband to rural Scotland&#8221;,</p><p>as part of the Government&#8217;s &#163;250&#160;million Scottish futures fund. Working with the enterprise agencies and local authorities, the Government intends to achieve that objective.</p><p>However, the programme&#8217;s objective is that next-generation broadband will be available to all by 2020&#8212;a significant challenge, which I freely acknowledge the market will find difficult to achieve. The difference in the level of funding between that which is proposed UK-wide and that which is necessary in Scotland is down to simple geographical spread and population sparsity. It is, therefore, inevitable that whatever we do and whatever we achieve, it will be more expensive to achieve that in Scotland than it is throughout the rest of the UK. That is why we must work together, rise to the challenge and ensure that, at the end of the process, we have a smooth movement to a situation in which rural broadband in Scotland is at least as good as&#8212;if not better than&#8212;it is in the rest of the UK.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-00448.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;; further welcomes the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to implement superfast broadband across the whole of the United Kingdom, and calls on Scottish and UK ministers to work together to achieve the best possible coverage for rural Scotland&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650024", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Connectivity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As well as supporting my amendment, I intend to support the Labour amendment.

Only 12 of the 32 local authorities have signed up and, by March this year, only six of the 12 had submitted proposals, with the matter under consideration in a further two. We are promised 1,200 homes under the first round of NHT, but we will be lucky to see 800. The tragedy is that ordinary families will pay the price of the failure.</p><p>There is a glimmer of hope. The Scottish Government, bereft of direction, threw in the towel and set up the innovation and investment fund, asking developers, councils and registered social landlords for ideas. The fund is massively oversubscribed and demonstrates that developers and RSLs are willing to engage and deliver homes in new and innovative ways. The SNP has at last realised that, as the Scottish Conservatives have been saying for years, a plodding, simplistic method of housing subsidy is unsustainable and the developer-led model demonstrates that landlords invest, make a return and&#8212;this is crucial&#8212;reinvest in more housing stock.

The way in which the Government is turning its back on the opportunity to realise the value of its assets and ensure that it uses its money for best effect can be demonstrated no better than by the Government&#8217;s reluctance to look at mutualising Scottish Water as an option in the longer term.

One area that has given me some concern is the reducing budget for wardens in sheltered housing&#8212;in Aberdeenshire at least. I picked up on the issue during the election campaign, when a number of people chose to raise it with me. I am concerned that there appears to be a trend in local authorities to prioritising cutting the cost of the services while not necessarily taking into account how best value can be achieved for the limited expenditure that is possible.</p><p>The specific case that I came across is a proposal to share warden services between two areas of sheltered accommodation that are 16 miles apart. The point of any such decision is, of course, to allow the providers to cut the number of staff or hours, but the effect is that transport will have to be provided, sometimes in emergencies or poor weather conditions, between the two sites.</p><p>It strikes me that there is an inconsistency in the way that budget cuts are being applied. Is the cabinet secretary in a position to express an opinion on how efficiencies are best achieved in areas such as sheltered housing?

If we do not, we could find ourselves with more such cases, not fewer.

Perhaps, in three or four years, they will become as cynical as I am and we will enjoy that.</p><p>On the subject of cynicism, I must say that I was genuinely surprised at the amicable nature of the speech that Kenny Gibson made. That bodes well for the future, but let us not hold our breath.</p><p>The debate is characterised by the fact that we have been discussing the subject for a long time. Although progress is slow in relative terms, we have come a very long way in developing green energy during the 12 years that the Scottish Parliament has been in existence.</p><p>There are some who have suggested&#8212;meanly, I think&#8212;that because we Conservatives do not agree with the bulk of the policies that the SNP proposes, it somehow automatically means that we do not believe in progressing green energy. Nothing could be further from the truth, but we would fail in our responsibility if we, as an Opposition party, did not point out some of the weaknesses in those policies. Such weaknesses exist, and I need to our emphasise our points on them.</p><p>We heard from Fergus Ewing that we can predict with near certainty that renewables will be a success. We also heard once again the commitment to 100 per cent of our electricity being generated by renewable means by 2020. However, as ever, he briskly skipped over some of the disadvantages. An ambition that requires that change to happen in only nine years will, by its nature, require us to depend on the existing technology, which will force us to develop onshore wind and, it is to be hoped, offshore wind within that short timescale. However, the timescale is too short for effective implementation of marine options. Consequently, it will take investment away from longer-term priorities. That is why I would like the Government to take a broader attitude to encouraging investment over time.</p><p>Another point that the Government has failed to take into account and which a number of members mentioned is the need for grid upgrade. The grid in Scotland was designed to take power out from central generation capacity to the far reaches of the country. We now need a grid that will do exactly the opposite. To some extent, in the initial years, the existing grid will have that effect as we reverse the net flow. The problem is that we need a grid that is designed to take large capacity from peripheral areas and bring it to our centres of population.</p><p>We can, of course, engineer the grid as required, but the example of the Beauly to Denny line indicates that any major grid upgrade could involve years of public inquiries, could involve massive public protest and, as we know for certain, will require massive investment. No indication has been given today of whether that can be achieved in the nine years ahead.</p><p>We heard from the minister a good old-fashioned, motherhood-and-apple-pie speech. Green energy is good&#8212;yes, we can all agree on that. We heard a bit of the Government blowing its own trumpet because, yes, it achieved a great deal in the past four years and will, no doubt, achieve more in the next five. However, it again forgets key elements of the problems that it faces.</p><p>Renewable energy has expanded largely because, if somebody can generate it, they get paid more for it than they do for other types of electricity. That means that, as we move towards greener, more renewable energy sources in Scotland, the average cost of our energy will go up too.</p><p>The Government has, of course, turned its back on the idea of extending nuclear capacity in Scotland. Its alternative to renewable energy is to push forward with carbon capture. The Conservatives want that technology to be developed, but we must consider the cost again. Applying carbon capture to our coal power stations will take the cost of energy up.</p><p>One or two members spoke about fuel poverty. I always like to mention fuel poverty because, whatever we do, it is essential that energy be available and affordable in the long term. The Government&#8217;s commitment to renewable energy and carbon capture as its only two strategies for generating electricity in the long term will take the cost of energy up, and it appears to have no strategy to avoid the problems.</p><p>A number of other issues were raised during the debate, one of which was planning. I feel that I am talking about something that goes back eight to 10 years to when we Conservatives asked the Government of the day to provide strategic planning guidance for local authorities for the implementation of planning applications, particularly for wind energy. I remember being supported by SNP members in opposition when we were making that call, but after four years of an SNP Government, I still have not seen what we wanted at that time. It is still the case that applications are largely called in and dealt with by central Government anyway. We should see stronger guidance on how planning applications should be handled by local authorities, particularly to protect local authorities from victimisation when a local authority that is willing to deal with the issues finds itself inundated with applications.</p><p>Green energy is the future. We will support it in principle, but I want to hear the Government answer those questions.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As ever, this has been an interesting debate.

I say &#8220;informative&#8221;, because members have talked about their experiences locally, and it seems that those experiences differ radically in different areas of the country. Another aspect of the debate is that it has been characterised by comparisons between individuals. In the previous speech, we heard what I believe was a comparison between Alison McInnes and Margaret Thatcher. It will be no surprise if that does not appear in Alison McInnes&#8217;s election leaflets during the forthcoming election. I am not exactly sure what was happening there.</p><p>Earlier, we heard comparison of Charlie Gordon to Mick Jagger. I do not know exactly where my colleague Jackson Carlaw got that from, but I take it that he believes that Charlie Gordon is one of the cheerleaders for the good old-fashioned Labour tradition in Scotland. I have great respect for Charlie Gordon, as he has been that to me for as long as I have known him and since he came to the Parliament. I feel a certain affinity with him, because I believe that I am on the same wing of the Conservative Party, if members know what I mean. Charlie and I have common ground. I will explain that a little, because I see Charlie indicating that it has gone over his head: when we accused him of being a dinosaur, I felt a certain affinity with him in that respect.</p><p>On buses and bus regulation, it would be irresponsible not to repeat the point that Scotland&#8217;s bus industry&#8212;yes, it is an industry&#8212;is an enormous success story. Since deregulation, two of the largest transport companies in the world have taken root in Scotland. They have grown and spread internationally to become major players in their industry. We should understand that and be grateful for it. Such success stories are hard to come by, so I welcome them. However, I do not accept that deregulation has caused market failure.</p><p>Bus services are provided over large areas of Scotland in a way that statistics indicate many passengers consider acceptable. In fact, the figures that Jackson Carlaw quoted earlier make it clear that there is a high level of satisfaction across the board. I am aware, though, that there will never be 100 per cent satisfaction because a complex system like a bus system will never satisfy every individual: there will always be someone who wants a change or improvement. However, I get letters regularly from people who have experienced changes or improvements but who want things to go back to the way they were. Perhaps they reflect Labour&#8217;s policy on the issue.</p><p>Let us look at some of the detail of the debate. Stewart Stevenson made it clear that there is no free ticket or bus pass to reregulation of the buses. Reregulation would cost a considerable amount of money, but Labour has been unable to tell us from where it would source it. Rob Gibson pointed out that there are huge opportunities in the current system to create efficiencies in public transport, especially in rural areas, where ideas such as demand-responsive travel, combining of public transport with some of the ambulance service&#8217;s responsibilities and improving timetabling can make a massive difference to delivering quality public transport without necessarily increasing the cost.</p><p>Alison McInnes talked at length about how the existing system can be exploited to change bus services for the better. She explained how she, like me, has been involved with individuals who want changes, and that if we address such issues with the bus companies we can often successfully achieve our objective. In contrast, Des McNulty seems to understand the process but believes that it cannot work unless we move to reregulation.</p><p>It has been asked whether the Labour Party is talking about reregulation or nationalisation. I accept that what Labour has said today is about reregulation. However, Labour back benchers have called for renationalisation of the railways. I recognise the differing language of the Labour front benches and back benches in that regard. Someone suggested that Charlie Gordon would never call for renationalisation of the buses, but I suggest that he would if he could, but perhaps understands that the time is not right.</p><p>Of all the things that we have learned during the debate, the one that concerns me is the uneven nature of services and how the current system appears to work well in some places but not in others. The buses in places such as Aberdeen and Edinburgh are modern and clean, and the services are efficient and achieve their objectives. However, people have talked about the poor quality of bus services in Glasgow. I have no personal experience of that, because I do not travel on the buses in Glasgow. However, I worry that there seems to be a stark contrast between what happens in Aberdeen and Edinburgh under the current system and what happens in Glasgow. I suggest that the evidence of Aberdeen and Edinburgh indicates that it is not reregulation that is necessary in Glasgow.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bus Services Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been interesting and it has been one of the more informative of its kind.

We have before us legislation that has been arrived at through a particular route. Of course, the Conservatives opposed the last-minute introduction of landlord registration schemes in the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill in 2004, because we believed that there had been no proper consultation at that time, and the provisions focused on creating good tenants rather than on improving the landlord-tenant relationship. However, we believe that progress has been made by the means that have been used. We need to ensure that the landlord registration scheme does not simply become a tax on landlords who provide good accommodation and service, but eliminates bad practice from the sector. Again, we have made significant progress on that today.</p><p>As the minister said, at stage 2 David McLetchie took the opportunity to lodge amendments that amended the Land Tenure Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 in relation to the 20-year rule&#8212;that is, the restriction on residential leases of more than 20 years and the right to redeem heritable securities after 20 years. The approach will allow ministers, by order, to prescribe bodies for whom the rules are relaxed, which is a vital step forward in the provision of effective housing.</p><p>HMO licensing became central to our consideration at stage 2, as it was at stage 3. I apologise for frightening a few horses at stage 2. In a discussion with Ted Brocklebank, I had agreed to ensure that HMO density was properly discussed at stage 2, so I lodged an amendment that was designed to ensure that the matter was discussed. My objective was not to require planning permission for all HMOs but to get the issue on the agenda. I apologise to anyone whom I frightened&#8212;I replied to their e-mails.</p><p>The objective was achieved. I withdrew the amendment that I had lodged at stage 2 and, after negotiation, Ted Brocklebank was able to lodge amendment 15 at stage 3. The amendment&#8217;s being agreed to has resulted in a change to the bill that I hope will deal with the problem that Ted Brocklebank identified in St Andrews, which I know exists and requires to be addressed in other areas of Scotland.</p><p>Today&#8217;s proceedings have been particularly interesting. During the past few days, the Parliament has considered a number of bills at stage 3 and very few amendments have come to a vote. We voted on an amendment today only to discover that it had been agreed to with 119 votes for and none against. I congratulate Pauline McNeill, who moved the unopposed amendment 1, and Ted Brocklebank, on their clever and astute political activity in recent days. The outcome demonstrates that if a person has experience of parliamentary procedure and works the system to their advantage, they can get their way&#8212;even if many members were surprised at just how close to the wire the voting went.</p><p>I pay tribute to Ted Brocklebank and hope that amendment 15 will serve as a memorial to his time in the Parliament. It will not be the only one; he has contributed a great deal during his time here, particularly on fisheries, his knowledge of which was valuable to us.</p><p>I say to all members who, like me, have dragged themselves around various housing organisations in recent weeks to do pre-election hustings, that many people out there think that we spend all our time fighting and arguing. My experience in the Local Government and Communities Committee, my experience during the passage of several bills in recent months and my experience of working with the minister indicate to me that, although we might have different ideas, we have the same objective.

Although there were concerns about there being three ballot papers and three different electoral systems in use on the same day, many people applied a great deal of thought in advance of that and believed that the system would work. The fact that it did not work demonstrated that we cannot cover every eventuality. That is why the bill may not achieve the objectives that we have set out for it.

I get the impression from what I heard from Patricia Ferguson that it is one of those bills that was brought in to deal with a specific issue and after it had been introduced we found that there were new issues to deal with. That is how I came to the bill.</p><p>As members may know, I came to the Local Government and Communities Committee halfway through the process and I also came to the committee with a concern, from my area, about the management of green space. It was only after I became familiar with the process that I became fully familiar with the problems that the bill was originally meant to deal with. I am afraid that, as we all know, there is a problem with rogue factors in Scotland. It is an industry that is&#8212;we might generously be tempted to say&#8212;by and large populated by people who do what they say and charge for what they actually do, but there are businesses in Scotland that have been contracted to carry out the work and have not done as we hoped they might.</p><p>My experience comes from the north-east. By and large, the problem there has been associated with the change in the planning requirements to provide more green space within developments. That green space requires to be managed by someone. As the area of the green space increased, local authorities were less keen to become involved and, more important, developers were less keen to pay local authorities to do the job.</p><p>The advent of the green space management company&#8212;the land maintenance company&#8212;was something that came to me, in my postbag, with a thump as the activities of such companies on different estates in the Aberdeen area and south towards Laurencekirk within my home range resulted in a series of complaints from people who were unaware that they had signed up to commitments, were dissatisfied with the service that was being provided for them and wished to change their arrangements but could not find a way to do that.</p><p>The bill shines a light into that area and offers an opportunity for many people to get out of the difficult situations in which they find themselves. Part 1 requires the registration of property factors. By establishing a register of factors, we will be able to define who is doing their job and who is not and, once that is defined, we will be able to identify them. The bill also defines how factors will be registered and identified. Part 2 provides for dispute resolution, which is vital given the number of disputes. However, the most important aspect is that the bill includes not only companies that are responsible for maintaining buildings, but land management companies. Although I am disappointed that we perhaps did not get as far as we could on that, I welcome the fact that the Government will continue to consult on the issue.</p><p>The bill has become relatively complex, as it has been amended several times to ensure that we cover every possible eventuality. The danger is that someone might be able to slip through the net. I hope that we have put together legislation that will not allow that to happen. However, let us always be vigilant. I, too, am disappointed that the legislation might not be fully commenced until October 2012, but I accept the minister&#8217;s reassurances that we should get the process right and that that is more important than doing it quickly. The minister said that there is a significant challenge, and I believe that.</p><p>I pay tribute to Patricia Ferguson for her work on the bill. I thank the minister for his support, which has ensured that although we each arrived at our position today through different routes, we now all agree about the process that we have gone through.

Given the fact that a consultation is in progress at the moment, it is reasonable for us to expect that views will be expressed.</p><p>As a Conservative, I see the highest priority for policing in Scotland over the next few years as being to maintain our current number of police officers. Conservatives were instrumental in ensuring that we got 1,000 police officers in the budget four years ago&#8212;we got that commitment in the first year, and we got the officers the subsequent year. Preserving those police officers on the streets of Scotland must be the highest priority.</p><p>Moving on from that, we have a situation in which Colin McKerracher, the chief constable of Grampian Police, is making public statements about his concerns about the effect of restructuring. He suggests that, as a result of restructuring, we might lose 4,000 police officers across Scotland, and 400 in the Grampian area. I believe that he is entitled to make that point, in whatever level of detail he wishes, and this is the right time for him to do so. However, I worry that the statement has been hijacked tonight by Mike Rumbles for some of the political reasons that I have mentioned. If the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland has a view to express, I welcome it, as part of the consultation. If there is evidence to suggest that policing across Scotland, particularly in the Grampian area, would be damaged by the proposals, I look forward to discussing it. However, the bottom line is that it is essential that we do not allow our chief police officers to be taken into what is, essentially, a political argument. We must allow them to argue their case on a structural and management basis, and we must ensure that we do not align our political parties with particular police officers.

Who knows? They may well be right. The Scottish Labour Party has form on that. In 2008, Labour members abstained on the final budget motion even though they had amended it and, in 2009, they chose to vote against the budget, only to U-turn on a loose promise of more apprenticeships, demonstrating yet again that Labour is for turning.</p><p>Having said that, I commend the Coalfields Regeneration Trust for its hard work, dedication and many successes. It has much to be proud of and its record is enviable.</p><p>Labour looks for further funding, but it strikes me that its record on providing an economic environment that would allow coalfield communities to flourish is significantly less than adequate. For example, no fewer than 1.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost throughout the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2009. This country&#8217;s manufacturing industry declined by a staggering 9.3 per cent in the same period, which is the largest decline on record under any Government.</p><p>Not content with that, Labour underlined its hapless economic record by taking the country to the brink of bankruptcy. It has left the Conservative-led coalition Government with the biggest peacetime deficit in history. In closing the debate, perhaps Johann Lamont will take a moment to reflect on the fact that, while she seeks to secure funding for the Coalfields Regeneration Trust, the UK Government is spending a staggering &#163;120 million on interest every day to try to pay off Labour&#8217;s historic legacy of debt.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644826", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It would be helpful, but all I can say is that, on inquiry, we were told that an announcement would be made soon.

The college has come a long way since the days when it would have described itself as a technical college and now offers a wide range of qualifications, with a diverse prospectus. It truly is Angus College, with learning centres in Brechin, Forfar, Montrose and Kirriemuir, as well as the headquarters in Arbroath. That makes it easier for students in a largely rural, low-income area to learn.</p><p>The local economy benefits hugely from the skills that are provided in the college environment. I pay particular tribute to the training restaurant, Restaurant 56, which provides hands-on training for those who would like to enter the hospitality industry, which is so important to the local economy. Another community benefit is the Inspire hair and beauty salon, where local men and women allow students to experiment on them. That is a terrible thing to say&#8212;no one has any problems with it.</p><p>The college also engages closely with the community and has been involved in raising money for charity in a number of ways. A few years ago, representatives of the college came to the Parliament as my guests in an attempt to collect as many pairs of shoes as possible from members of the Parliament. Their objective was to create the longest line of shoes that had ever been made; I believe that they succeeded in doing that. I donated a few pairs of shoes. My wife engaged enthusiastically in the project; in fact, at one point, she was down to her last 35 pairs.</p><p>Angus College enjoys an excellent relationship with many organisations in Angus, especially Angus Council, where students have the opportunity to experience on-the-job training. Like many community colleges in Scotland, it plays a vital role in providing qualifications and training, including evening classes, that fit in with students&#8217; lives, jobs and family commitments.</p><p>However, not all on the horizon is rosy. It has been mentioned that a campaign is taking place on bursaries. I have had approximately 600 e-mails from people in the north-east on the subject and it is notable that Angus College students are well represented among those correspondents. A solution to that problem will need to be found.</p><p>One way in which Angus College has offered help to the community is by giving people a second chance to gain increasingly important qualifications. Many mature students choose to attend college to brush up their skills or pursue an entirely new career path. That second chance is extremely important for some, particularly the prisoners at Noranside open prison, who have enjoyed a good working relationship with the community college and have taken advantage of the opportunities that it provides. However, the threat that hangs over the prison means that that link may be about to come to an end.</p><p>Finally, I will do as many members have done and pay tribute to Andrew Welsh. As many members will know, I have stood against him in the Angus constituency at the past two Scottish Parliament elections. I finished second but, in all honesty, I was some distance behind the incumbent. After he beat me last time, I remember being interviewed by a journalist from Radio Tay, who stuck a microphone under my nose and said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s twice he&#8217;s gubbed you. What are you going to do now?&#8221; Searching for something to say, I said that I was going to change tack and attempt to outlive him.

However, anyone who was around an electoral count on the night of that first Thursday in May in 2007&#8212;or perhaps the Friday morning&#8212;saw what happened as we appeared to sleepwalk into a situation in which hundreds of thousands of Scots had their votes discounted. That was a mistake that should have been foreseen, but the institutions did not exist to point out the problem. The bill marks a major step towards ensuring that such institutions do exist in future.</p><p>The terms of the Gould report made it clear that changes were necessary. The Scottish Local Government (Elections) Act 2009, which was designed to separate Scottish parliamentary and local government elections once and for all, was a major step. The Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Bill, which will have the effect of establishing an electoral management board for Scotland, and which will extend the statutory powers of the Electoral Commission to cover local government elections in Scotland, is the second major step forward in achieving the objective of avoiding the problem that we had before.</p><p>I was listening carefully to what the minister was saying, particularly in relation to the future remit of the electoral management board for Scotland. I accept what he said about not going forward or extending it to the whole range of subjects to which it could be applied, yet I welcome the minister&#8217;s intention to ensure that the board&#8217;s remit is extended to Scottish Parliament elections. I look forward to hearing what is said during the further passage of the bill on a range of other possibilities.</p><p>Much of what has to be said about the bill has been said already, so I do not intend to go into too much detail. However, I am interested in something that Michael McMahon raised, which I was tempted to raise myself but dismissed: the AV issue. I would dispute Michael McMahon&#8217;s assertion that a referendum on AV on the same day as the Scottish election might be disruptive. I think that asking people to give a simple yes or no will not cause confusion or difficulty, but I am genuinely worried about what might happen in the longer term, when we could end up with an AV election and a Scottish Parliament election on the same day, which would result in our walking into a multiplicity of electoral systems. I am glad that, once it has been passed, the bill will have the effect of giving us bodies that can administer that properly. I am sure that everyone is well aware of the fact that I am opposed to AV, but you never know what might happen, so we should be prepared.</p><p>The Conservatives will support the general principles of the bill at stage 1. I believe that it is a major step forward that will complete the process that was necessary to overcome the problems that we experienced back in May 2007.

It is clear that, as the Government appears to have taken a scorched-earth approach to social housing funding, the private sector is playing an increasingly important role in providing properties for rent.</p><p>Crucial to the debate is the fact that a substantially increased proportion of ARLA members&#8217; offices&#8212;34 per cent in quarter 3 last year, as opposed to 19 per cent in Q2&#8212;believe that they are seeing an increase in property coming on to the rental market because it cannot be sold. That group is now often referred to as the reluctant landlords. Therefore, it is vital not only that any legislation clearly articulates a landlord&#8217;s responsibilities, but that the legislation be enforced.</p><p>I welcome the substantial increase in fines for non-registration that the bill introduces, but there is little point in the increase if someone who is found not to have registered as a landlord is not prosecuted. Such a substantial fine as is proposed would certainly be a deterrent, but the fact remains that, as at May last year, not a single prosecution had been brought for failure to register under the current landlord registration scheme. That suggests either that all is well in the private rented sector&#8212;in which case, there is little need for the bill&#8212;or that there is a reluctance to prosecute. I am inclined to suggest that it is the latter, given the fact that councils had issued more than 1,300 late application fees and more than 1,200 rent penalty notices by 31 March last year.</p><p>That said, a commonsense approach must be taken. We are extremely supportive of the introduction of tenant information packs, but there is considerable concern about the level of information that they will be required to contain. Some of the suggestions for inclusion in tenant information packs that I have heard are simply not practical or are superfluous. However, if the right balance is struck, I am certain that tenant information packs will be an asset in promoting sustainable tenancies. That is vital, especially for more vulnerable tenants.</p><p>I welcome the fact that a more holistic approach is now being taken to houses in multiple occupation. Refusing an HMO licence that would breach planning controls will be possible. It is therefore important that local authorities use planning controls and local housing policies to maintain balance in their communities and ensure that they remain sustainable, especially in areas in which the vast majority of HMOs are aimed at the student population.</p><p>However, there is growing concern about the variation in fees that councils across the country are charging for processing HMO applications. For example, a new application for a five-bed HMO in Angus, where HMOs are predominantly used to house migrant workers, may cost just &#163;386 for the first year&#8212;the fee is reduced for renewal applications&#8212;but in the city of Aberdeen, the cost of the same HMO licence has risen from just &#163;237 in 2006-07 to a staggering &#163;1,500 in 2011-12, with no discount offered for renewals. I am aware that HMO licences in Aberdeen are for longer than one year, but that is still a substantial sum of money for a landlord to find in the first instance. Landlords must be assured that the fees that they are charged come to absolutely no more than the cost of processing the applications and running the system.</p><p>Given that the balance of tenure is shifting, with many people being forced to rent their home rather than buy because of stringent lending criteria, and more individuals becoming landlords because of a depressed housing market or a poor return on their savings, the Scottish Conservatives believe that the bill is a step in the right direction. It is certainly not, however, the comprehensive solution that may be required in the medium term. On that basis, we will support the bill at this stage, but we are disappointed that there is nothing in it to encourage greater investment in the sector by private institutions. In that respect it is, as Mary Mulligan would say, a missed opportunity. That said, I acknowledge the points that the minister made in his opening speech, in which he suggested that there are areas in which the national Government could help.</p><p>It is obvious that there is still a lot of work to be done. I urge the Scottish Government to remain open to the views of stakeholders in order to deliver a bill that is an important step forward in managing the expectations of landlords and tenants, so that a better relationship between the two, and better relationships with the wider community, can be achieved.

I believe that this is genuinely the right time for the report to come forward. The opportunities that we will be able to seize upon are very valuable. Before I get to my conclusions, I intend to go back over a considerable period of time, although I assure everyone that I will not go back nearly as far as Jeremy Purvis went; I will not be talking about the Selkirk Merchant Company&#8217;s involvement in the Darien scheme&#8212;we can go too far sometimes.</p><p>The reason why we are where we are today in relation to inward investment and export is part of a long cycle and a result of a number of decisions that were made. Sometimes those decisions were extremely successful in the short term but left us in an exposed position in the longer term.</p><p>In the early 1990s, a Conservative Government and Scottish Office realised how important it was to create growth in the Scottish economy, and achieved it by bringing in large amounts of foreign investment. The companies, which we heard the minister list earlier, such as Hewlett-Packard, made substantial investments here, which created strong economic growth and high levels of export, which we are comparing ourselves against today.</p><p>However, that investment did not deliver in the longer term because, when recession came, the companies that had moved in here, which were often paid substantial grants to do so, were last in and first out. Their priorities lay elsewhere. It became clear that not only the quantity but the quality of investment was important. We have monuments to that in Scotland. Investments were planned by Motorola, Hyundai, and Chunghwa&#8212;remember them?&#8212;that cost the taxpayer in Scotland but never delivered because they were never completed and never opened.</p><p>As we move forward, we need to consider why that happened. There was a recession but, as we moved on towards the end of the 1990s and into the new century, we got ourselves into a position where exports were always likely to be weak and inward investment was always going to be unlikely, simply because the value of our currency was too high. At one point, the value of the euro was 54p. At that stage, it was difficult to sell anything outside the UK economy, and certainly in Europe. Anything that we might wish to buy was much cheaper if it was bought in Europe. One thing for which we should praise Gordon Brown directly is that, in his 10 years as chancellor and three years as Prime Minister, he was never once tempted to take us into the single currency. Had we joined that currency at 54p to the euro, we would have been doomed to have been uneconomic for ever.</p><p>However, things are better now and the opportunity comes once again for Scotland to build on its exports and its reputation and attract inward investment. That is why I was particularly interested in Jim Mather&#8217;s comments when he talked about SDI and its activities. He pointed out that not only does SDI have to attract investment from abroad, it has to attract the right kind of investment.</p><p>It is not so many years ago that the idea of large inward investment was dismissed entirely as a way out of our economic problems. I am glad to hear it being spoken of positively once again. However, we must learn from the mistakes of the past. In favourable economic circumstances, it can be a wonderful opportunity to build our economy and exports quickly by bringing in the investors that will deliver on the shortest timescale. We need to ensure that we do not make the same mistake a second time. When we attract investment to Scotland, it must be for the long term. We must find ways to ensure that the right types of company come here and that when they come here, they are here to stay. That way, we can guarantee employment over the long term and we can build Scotland&#8217;s export future back towards the position that we were in 20 or more years ago.</p><p>It is also important to realise that change is cyclical and that, as we are outside the euro zone, currency valuations may fluctuate. However, if we do what we are good at and use the opportunities that our traditional industry provides and, more important, the opportunities that our high-quality further and higher education systems deliver through valuable potential employees, Scotland will have tremendous opportunities ahead of it.</p><p>As I said at the beginning of my speech, the report has come at the right time. I believe that the recession that we have suffered is coming to an end. The figures that have been announced today on employment in Scotland&#8212;on falling unemployment and the rising total number of those employed&#8212;are an indication that the way ahead is not blocked with the disadvantages that we feared only a few months ago. The report has indeed come at the right time.

I can just about remember the time before there was an oil industry in the North Sea. It was a wonderful discovery when we found that we had all that oil and gas out there, off the shore of the north and east of the country. As Stewart Stevenson said earlier, who would have thought that this little country of ours could win the jackpot twice in one generation. In the early development of renewables it became very clear that, if wind and waves were the way to go, Scotland had plenty of both.</p><p>We have known for a long time about the opportunity of developing our renewables industry. The regime that was in place previously did a great deal to bring that forward. In fact, if anyone took the trouble to look back at some of the things that I have said over the past 12 years, they would discover that even I have been surprised at the developments in the renewables sector in Scotland. I was perhaps one of those who cast doubt on the opportunities or the speed at which development would take place. I now accept that we are achieving the targets that were set. I now realise that the opportunity exists to develop this area still further.</p><p>The system that was put in place to underpin that&#8212;in particular, the renewables obligation certificates&#8212;has proven itself, albeit that it was obvious to many that something had to change. That is why it is a disappointment that it has taken so long, and a change of Government, to come forward with proposals to change or develop the electricity market. Electricity market reform is an overdue subject and one that we must discuss.</p><p>As a number of members have said, it is important to ensure that we do not undermine the confidence of investors. Unlike some in the chamber, I believe that the private sector will <place-holder colnum=\"32245\"/> produce the necessary investment. I also believe that the sector will bring forward the potential development that we know exists in so many areas of Scotland. Unless we build confidence within the industry, and in those who have enough money to invest in it, we run the risk of undermining that development. It is crucial that what the Government proposes in its consultation document is an overlapping system that will take us forward. It should allow those who have already invested to rely on the old regime while offering the opportunity of a new regime for those who are about to go into a new phase of investment. We are moving from the situation where we are used to seeing wind turbines appear on our hillsides to seeing turbines appear in large numbers off our coast. That will happen in the not-too-distant future and will be a significant change.</p><p>In looking at the structures that we have debated today, and as the word \"nuclear\" is mentioned in my colleague Gavin Brown's amendment, I must mention nuclear energy and make some comparisons.</p><p>I have already said in the Parliament that I think that Scotland has missed the boat on nuclear power. If we were to replace one of our nuclear power stations, we would have had to make that decision before now. The decision not to do so was a bad one that we will live to regret.</p><p>When we talk enthusiastically about carbon capture and storage, we are talking about a technology that is not comparable in price to simply burning coal and pumping the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We are talking about a technology that will be expensive and difficult to implement. When all the costs are taken into account, it may be significantly more expensive than nuclear energy. That is why, as I have said before, I believe that Scotland will have its nuclear power station but that it will be built south of the border and that we will use the electricity that it sends north through the grid.</p><p>It is important that that possibility is retained because, as we consider the key elements in this issue, we cannot ignore the elephant in the room: the transmission charging regime. If we are to cover the north of Scotland in renewable electricity generation devices and supply that electricity to the south of England or, for that matter, mainland Europe, we must have a regime in place that allows the consumer to pay for the cost of the grid development that will be necessary. That means that what we have at the moment is not fit for purpose. The Lib Dem-Conservative coalition Government should be praised for having moved forward so quickly. I welcome that.</p><p>So where are we going? What do we have to do here in Scotland? A number of issues mentioned in the debate are worthy of mention again. Rob <place-holder colnum=\"32246\"/> Gibson raised the subject of hydro. We all seem to forget that we led the world in hydro for a while. We have the opportunity to do so once again. Stewart Stevenson pointed out that we need to find a way to store all this renewable energy. The hydrogen economy may be coming, but it is some way off. However, we have the opportunity to store energy through pump storage, which is why key decisions about developing pump storage in Scotland, perhaps taking some of our existing hydro schemes and converting them to pump storage, is vital to continuity.</p><p>Remote renewables need grid improvements, which will be expensive. If we are to do that, we need to ensure that it is the consumer, wherever he or she may be, who contributes to that development. For that to happen, we must be part of a bigger marketplace than simply Scotland. To be part of a UK-wide marketplace would give us a tremendous opportunity to draw money in for investment and to hedge our bets, in case anything that we do turns out to be either inadequate in terms of supply or overly expensive in terms of cost. By spreading that load throughout the United Kingdom and&#8212;let us face it&#8212;beyond, we have a tremendous advantage that we should not turn our backs on. I cannot accept Rob Gibson's idea that there should be some sort of firewall between Scotland and England in terms of the electricity market.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21178165", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I confess that I am not as young as I used to be.

I only wonder why it has taken us so long to get to this stage. As has become clear during the debate, the reason is partially that certain elements of the subject are a minefield. For that reason I do not simply congratulate Patricia Ferguson on making it this far; she has my sympathy as well. She will have my support as the bill progresses.</p><p>We heard from a number of members, including Patricia Ferguson at the outset, that the bill has become necessary because there are those who have found themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous people. It would appear that legislation has become necessary because of the behaviour of a particular sector. Like many others, I emphasise that I genuinely believe that there are competent and responsible property and land managers in Scotland who are doing their job effectively, but it is all too clear from the evidence that has been presented that a surprisingly high proportion do not live up to those standards. We heard that from a number of members who have given examples today.</p><p>I am prepared to acknowledge that the justification for the bill lies largely among those who operate as property factors for blocks of flats and other buildings across Scotland, but I share the experience that Mary Mulligan described. The cases that have come to my attention tend to relate to land maintenance companies. In many cases, green space has been allocated within an estate and there is a requirement to find a manager. My experience has led me to find out that some extraordinary things are happening, especially where development has taken place quickly and on a large scale. In Westhill near Aberdeen, for example, three different estates ended up in separate disputes with a land manager. An estate in Laurencekirk has also ended up in such a dispute.</p><p>I find that, as with other things, the people who find themselves in such disputes would like to find a way out of the arrangement that they have become involved in but, more important, they would far rather that the company simply delivered the service for which the householders are paying. That is why it is so important that we ensure that we have registration of property factors, a code of conduct and a means of dispute resolution. Those are the key elements that the bill would introduce.</p><p>As we have heard, there was a concerted attempt to introduce a voluntary accreditation scheme, but its failure to appear within an acceptable timescale and the doubts that many speakers from all parts of the chamber have cast on whether it would have the desired effect have brought me and others to the stage where it is <place-holder colnum=\"31322\"/> obvious, if it was not before, that a proper statutory route is needed if we are to achieve the objectives.</p><p>Other interesting parts of the debate related to the changes that will need to be made to the bill and to existing legislation if we are to achieve our objectives. I was delighted to hear David McLetchie point out how competition can drive up standards. I was surprised to hear that resounding around the chamber and being repeated by members from all political parties&#8212;because we do not always find support for our views on competition. It is obvious that if people have the right to change factors, competition will deliver improved standards. The problem is that so few people have the opportunity to change factors or land maintenance companies. To make that possible, it might well be necessary to look at other legislation and consider changes to the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.</p><p>We are in the unusual position of considering a bill that is not in black-and-white form. Although a number of potential changes have been highlighted in the debate, the bill has the chamber's support. The process will not be easy&#8212;indeed, in introducing this bill Patricia Ferguson has stepped into a minefield&#8212;but she will have my support and the support of the Conservatives.

In his opening speech, Jim Mather said that he had a strong opinion on the issue, but he kept his remarks reasonable and rational. I will begin by addressing the points that he made.</p><p>Jim Mather wanted to ensure that people were able to deal with the vote on an informed basis. I have heard nothing in today's debate that tells me that the people of Scotland cannot vote in a referendum on an informed basis on the same day as a Scottish Parliament election. The argument against that seems to be based on the fact that we had some problems on the day of the 2007 election, but there seems to be some confusion or <place-holder colnum=\"30683\"/> misunderstanding about what happened on that day.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the Labour Party was perfectly happy for local government and Scottish Parliament elections to take place on the same day in 1999 and 2003. Those election days were successful because the electoral systems that were used did not lead to confusion. In 2007, the same two elections took place on one day, but a different electoral system was in place. When electors cast their votes, they knew perfectly clearly for whom and for what they wanted to vote, but they applied the wrong electoral system to the wrong ballot paper. We lost a lot of votes because of that. However, I do not suggest for a moment that people did not understand what they were doing when they set out to cast their votes.</p><p>It is proposed not to hold two elections on the same day but to have a referendum on the same day as the Scottish Parliament election. There will be a simple question, to which the answer will be yes or no. The Scottish electorate is perfectly qualified and able to make up its mind about that question.</p><p>I am rather more concerned about something that has been running through the debate at a deeper level. I accept that, when such issues come along, the SNP will use them as an opportunity to raise the temperature of political debate, to set out its arguments for independence and to try to drive a wedge between Holyrood and Westminster.

The phrase that has been rolled out time and again is that we are suffering the worst cuts since the days of Margaret Thatcher. Would that be the same Margaret Thatcher who gave year-on-year, real-terms budget increases to Scotland throughout her period in government? Yes, we are in the peculiar position that we are suffering worse cuts in Scotland than were made by that imaginary person&#8212;the skeleton that the Labour members like to rattle when elections come along.</p><p>The debate has been about rattling skeletons. The Labour Party has made the revision of history its stock in trade, starting with the opening speeches of the debate. We were told that everything that happened to the economy under the Labour Government was the result of international deficiencies. International problems caused Labour's problems in government, and yet everything that happened in Scotland was the SNP's fault; that is a strange combination of understanding. Furthermore, everything that has happened since May this year is the fault of the Tory-Liberal coalition in London.</p><p>That kind of rhetoric will not go down well with the Scottish people, who want to see their politicians working together constructively, looking forward and attempting to find a way out of the current crisis. The Labour Party's tunnel vision, characterised by the 1,000-yard stare that can be seen in its members' eyes every time that someone raises a point that criticises their perceived logic, means that we do not have the support of the Labour Party in achieving that necessary consensus. Labour is isolated in Scotland, and it will remain isolated because it will not see the bigger picture.</p><p>The problem that we have in Scotland is that, increasingly it would seem, we believe that the public sector and public sector expenditure is the only way out of the crisis. If we look at the Labour Government that was in power in London for 13 years, we see a party that enjoyed the benefits of a booming economy for a long time, but failed to realise that what it should do with a booming economy is grow the tax base and not just enjoy the fact that the tax yield happens to be buoyant at the time. That is why we had a structural deficit before we had an international crisis. That is why this country had a crisis that took us from being one of the most buoyant economies in the G7 to <place-holder colnum=\"30004\"/> being one of the least buoyant, with the biggest deficit at the end of that period. We are worse off because of the way in which Labour conducted itself.</p><p>Earlier in the debate, Jeremy Purvis took the opportunity to point out very clearly that Scotland's budget after the spending review is rather better than it might have been if Labour had won the election. The spending commitments that Chancellor Alistair Darling made prior to the election suggest that, for Scotland to be any better off than it is today, he would have had to propose a second budget in which he abandoned all his plans. Perhaps that reflects the sudden review of policy that the Labour Party has enjoyed under its new leadership.</p><p>Scotland needs politicians who work together. That is why I would love to see the Labour Party come on board and get involved in the process of discussion, engagement and involvement that other parties in the Parliament are prepared to consider. Yet we hear the same criticisms time and again. Labour takes the year zero approach. It seems to believe that, if it denies everything that happened on its watch and starts from year zero, it can argue a completely different case and retain its credibility.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm's Freudian slip seemed to tell the truth, although he did not quite realise what he had said; it was a truth repeated time and again by other speakers. We have heard the extraordinary idea that budgets can perhaps be increased in Scotland, but it is not the Labour Party's job to say whether that will happen through tax increases or some form of borrowing, or whether, as it would seem, it will simply make local authorities pay for it all by ending the council tax freeze and pushing up the level of council tax. I was interested to hear that we will see a flowering of local democracy by ending the council tax freeze and allowing local politicians to make decisions about how they will raise taxes&#8212;up to a limit of 2 per cent.</p><p>We are very lucky. The 6.8 per cent real-terms cut over four years in the Scottish budget is not nearly as bad as it could have been. Scotland can survive this if its politicians pull together and if we engage constructively in the process of improving the efficiency of our public services and ensuring that they are adequately funded through this difficult period.

We desperately need ideas in Scotland today. The reason why is that we have increasingly developed a mismatch between the demands of Scottish industry and the Scottish economy and the nature of the graduates that we are producing.

It will suit those who wish to have a more broken-up career structure, and it will facilitate those who wish to take up higher education opportunities later in life, because they will be able to do that, in some cases while they are in paid employment. It will also give appropriate respect to vocational training, which starts people at a level that is appropriate to their school qualifications and takes them through the system, delivering opportunities and enabling them to achieve as they develop their ability.

After all, housing&#8212;either its supply or, just as important, the quality of life enjoyed by the occupants&#8212;affects everybody who lives in Scotland, so it is only right that Parliament devotes time to these issues. I welcome the opportunity that the debate offers us today.</p><p>In preparing for the debate, I tried to imagine what the minister would say. Although he threw me in one or two areas, by and large he covered the areas in the way that I expected and did what I <place-holder colnum=\"28601\"/> expected him to do. Predictability is not a fault in itself, but perhaps what the minister did not say is just as interesting.</p><p>With the inevitability of night following day, the minister continues to demonise the right to buy and, by implication, the ordinary families who took advantage of the opportunity to buy their own home and claim a stake in the future of their communities. Of course, the uncomfortable reality for opponents of the right to buy is that on 31 March this year almost five times as many social homes were lying empty as had been sold under the right to buy in the whole of the proceeding year.</p><p>On new build, I welcome the fact that just over 8,000 affordable homes have been built under the affordable housing investment programme, but let us not forget that it was also this Government that slashed the affordable homes budget by an eye-watering 45 per cent, which, in Grampian, for example&#8212;this is my press release&#8212;meant a reduction from &#163;34 million to &#163;21 million. Councils throughout the country were left to go into debt and to fork out &#163;300 million to build new homes just to help the minister's much-loved press coverage.</p><p>It is about not only building homes but building cohesive, sustainable communities that people want to live in and which they feel a sense of ownership for. However, people in communities tell me that a sizeable minority of people are treating their neighbours and their neighbourhoods with contempt. A typical example is that of a 16-year-old girl in Angus who was evicted for antisocial behaviour and then rehoused in a flat where the neighbours were all elderly. The block of flats quickly descended into chaos as the girl held parties all night and all day, terrifying the other residents. Not only did the police raid the property looking for drugs, but the girl's associates trashed it, looking for the same thing.

I have come to the Housing (Scotland) Bill slightly later than some, but I have read through the paperwork that has been produced, including the stage 1 report. I was interested to find out that, as has emerged during the debate, members' views on the bill are less than unanimous. A popular view, which a number of members have expressed, is that although the bill might be necessary, it needs to be changed. Even the minister has expressed doubt about whether some issues should be tackled in the bill or in the subsequent bill to deal with the private rented sector that he is planning. In other words, the bill seems to be a bit of a work in progress.</p><p>However, I intend to go through the issues and talk to them from a Conservative point of view. I want to be constructive and inclusive and to make some clear statements about where the Conservatives are coming from.</p><p>I am interested to hear the views that have been expressed about private landlords and the private rented sector. Indeed, it is characteristic of the debate that there is, as ever, hostility to anything that contains the word \"private\". What worries me greatly about that is that the minister has made it clear that the private rented sector has a major part to play in providing affordable housing for rent in Scotland in the years to come. In fact, with the difficulties with long-term finances that yesterday's budget set out, it is inevitable that if we are to make progress in the sector, we need to bring in more private money, more private investment and more private capital. For that reason, it is essential that we do nothing, in the bill or in any subsequent legislation, that would have the effect of reducing the amount of housing that will be available in the future through private landlords in the rented sector. There are plenty of historical examples of how failure to regulate appropriately has meant that we have lost the contribution that the private sector can make.</p><p>I welcome some of the things that have been said about landlord registration. It is obvious that the existing legislation has not functioned. Many of <place-holder colnum=\"27614\"/> the people whom I have talked to say that those landlords who have been involved in the process have been self-selecting because they are good landlords anyway, and that the fees involved have simply been a tax on responsible landlords. The existing legislation is not achieving its objective and, although I hear everything that has been said about the experiences in Govanhill and other places, and I fully support the position that has been taken on them, over the rest of Scotland, where the problems are perhaps different, the scheme has been equally ineffective, so it requires to be reviewed.</p><p>As we talk about some of the other provisions in the bill, I must move on quickly to the issue of the right to buy. Members will not be surprised to hear that I believe that the right to buy was the single most important driver for social change in Scotland in the past 50 years and that, as such, we must respect the contribution that it has made. However, even in today's debate, we have failed to recognise that contribution, and I will make one further point on that. We have heard a number of contributions, including an extremely good speech from Karen Gillon, who pointed out some of the problems that we have in our communities today. However, the safest and most sustainable communities to be found anywhere in Scotland are those that started out as high-quality housing estates that were built for rent and in which significant numbers of houses passed into the private sector. Those mixed-tenure communities have made great progress in dealing with issues such as antisocial behaviour, and they are genuinely safe communities throughout most of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20861155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am tempted to start by asking, \"Where do I start?\" It has been an interesting debate.

We could argue about how that compares with other parts of the United Kingdom, but many jobs were created in Scotland. At the same time, the increasing dependency culture&#8212;the effect of the greater and increasing safety net that was provided&#8212;meant that it was more and more difficult for people who required work to take up the jobs that were created. That led to significant immigration levels. I do not object to immigration, but I am worried that many jobs that were created were taken by people who moved to Scotland for them rather than by people who were already here and who could have taken them.</p><p>In the recent general election campaign, I knocked on many doors and I was particularly taken by one group whom I met&#8212;single mothers. An extraordinary number of single mothers wish to be part of the workforce and have skills that they want to deliver into the workforce. Despite that, the support that they are provided with makes it virtually impossible for them to return to the workforce. Seeing such a huge and well-motivated group of people in the economy unable to take advantage of the opportunities that are provided for them seriously disappointed me.</p><p>The challenge is that we in Scotland require to rebalance our economy. Through a period of considerable wealth, we grew the public sector and consequently became more dependent on the redistribution of the wealth that we had. Some see the current situation as an effort to bridge the gap between the position that we were in some years ago and a return to that position in a year or two. I do not believe that we will find ourselves in that situation. We need to think hard and objectively about how we achieve an economy that generates wealth and redistributes it effectively, so that we can begin to reduce poverty, not necessarily through the primary redistribution of wealth from top to bottom but through the creation of wealth at the bottom.<place-holder colnum=\"27499\"/></p><p>That is why I particularly support the position that Jeremy Purvis described. If he had been on the doorsteps of West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, he would know that I argued for the policy of raising personal allowances to take low-paid workers out of the tax system. By taking that option, we will deliver the opportunity for a huge number of people who are able and willing to work to benefit from their efforts. That is one way out of poverty. Increasing personal allowances also gives us the opportunity to focus again on concentrating our support on people who cannot take up such an opportunity. If we have a continuing difficulty in generating the necessary wealth, it is important to focus our efforts on those people.</p><p>We in Scotland are lucky. Poverty here is largely relative. In comparison with many parts of the world, even the poorest in our society are relatively wealthy. Those who have seen some of the coverage of what happens in South Africa at the moment will realise that we are lucky. However, here in Scotland we have a fundamental responsibility to end dependency culture, wherever possible, to give those who are in a position to do so the opportunity to benefit from their own hard work and effort, and to concentrate the support that is necessary on those who need it most. For that reason, we support the principles that lie behind the Government's motion and will continue to work to ensure that our economy is rebalanced, so that we can provide progress in years to come.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20853184", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Poverty Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Patrick Harvie for his question, because he moves me on to a case study that I will use to demonstrate that, although we have had a problem in recent years, it has a solution that can be used effectively.

The order that is before the Parliament today sets out ambitious targets to achieve that in the period leading up to 2020.

When the ambitious target was introduced, it gave me grave cause for concern; the change from 34 per cent to 42 per cent caused me to question my support for the bill. In the end, after the debate, I accepted the target, as did my Conservative colleagues. It is therefore essential that we now look at how the target will be achieved. The order is a route map of how to achieve that objective.

That is indeed important. However, it is also important for us to remember that there is an environmental issue that is not directly based on climate change: people who live under the approaches to London's airports, particularly Heathrow, are subject to the environmental impact of large numbers of aircraft.

In fact, the plant is an integral part of the oil and gas industry, because we use some of its by-products, such as the distillate that is removed from the gas <place-holder colnum=\"25514\"/> supply before it is pumped to the rest of the country. Consequently, it has an economic impact beyond that of a simple power station, and its importance cannot be underestimated.</p><p>As Lewis Macdonald said, we must realise that the current arrangements have been significantly beneficial to a significant number of people in the north of Scotland, and we must ensure that we protect those people.</p><p>We will fully support Liam McArthur's amendment.

Of course, as a member of the Green party, he always comes to these debates with a very different perspective. As is often the case, I understood what he said, but today perhaps he tried to extend into other areas of the debate, whereas many members tried to concentrate on the key issues.</p><p>It is true that energy infrastructure is a controversial issue, and I was glad to hear Patrick Harvie say that. There is a problem in Scotland. No matter what we say about the charging regime and how we apply that to the construction of grid extensions and alternative grids in future, the not-in-my-backyard attitude that we continue to see in many places in Scotland is holding the industry back. I freely admit that I am as guilty as any member of supporting people who object to specific developments. However, as we progress, we must ensure that, where grid development is the priority, we do not make the mistake of constructing grids simply to support proposals that have been approved. We must realise that the priority for renewable energy will move north towards the Pentland Firth and the northern isles, and offshore on the east coast. Simply building or extending grid to suit developments that have been approved, many of which are onshore, is not necessarily the way to get the best value for money in future.

The fair fuel stabiliser would ensure that the economy was less exposed to the instability of international oil markets and would keep prices at the pump more consistent. Under the proposal, fuel duty would fall when fuel prices went up. When fuel prices went down, fuel duty would rise again.

How can money that is brought in through such a scheme be used effectively to support companies such as ADL without incurring the wrath of European legislation on how tendering processes are conducted?

Where will the money to expand the free bus travel scheme come from? I do not even need a specific indication of where there would be a cut.

Earlier today, Alison McInnes mentioned that my amendment was ungenerous but, typically, the Liberal Democrat amendment is extremely generous with public money. I believe that the two, put together, come to a consensual position that we will be able to support. Consequently, we will support the Lib Dem amendment. I find absolute common ground with the issues that have been brought to the debate by Sarah Boyack's motion, so I will not oppose anything that it mentions.</p><p>In the limited time that is available to me, I will concentrate on one aspect of the motion, which is the issue of replacing Government vehicles with more fuel efficient electric or hybrid vehicles in the long term. We face an enormous problem and it is only partly related to the fact that we have a <place-holder colnum=\"24698\"/> problem with global warming caused by carbon emissions. We also have a problem that oil reserves will run out in the long term and we have to find an alternative way to operate and run our economy.</p><p>The suggestion in the motion that the Government should begin now to replace its fleet of cars with hybrid or electric vehicles is a very good one. It seems likely that, over time, there will be some competition over the technology that we choose to use, but the signs are that the consensus may be heading towards batteries rather than fuel cells as the way to power cars in the future. I understand that the Honda FCX Clarity, which is the most advanced fuel-cell-operated car that is currently available, still costs almost &#163;1 million a unit and, consequently, is unlikely to have an impact in the next 10 or 20 years, so it looks very much as if what we are looking at are electric and hybrid vehicles. For that to happen, we need the Government to commit. That means that I support the principle that the Government should be looking at such vehicles when cars are to be replaced. I would not suggest for a moment that we should be selling off brand new BMWs and replacing them with hybrids this very day, as that is neither energy nor carbon efficient, but when the opportunity arises it should be taken. We also need to look slightly further ahead to find out exactly how the ministerial Prius, or whatever it is, will be refuelled on its long journey to Strichen and back. As a consequence, we must look carefully at the suggestion made in the Liberal Democrat amendment.</p><p>If people are to take the risk of buying electric or electric hybrid vehicles, they must believe that they will be able to refuel them as they go around the country. Consequently, it is essential that the Government takes a lead in ensuring that recharging points are available. If we make that move, we will be able to encourage people to make cost-effective decisions to exchange hydrocarbon-fuelled cars for electric or electric hybrid cars, which will benefit the environment, the economy and the owners of those vehicles, as it will be possible to achieve much lower running costs, especially if the system for refuelling them is more broadly available.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20701619", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful that the minister has committed to supporting both my amendment and that of the Liberal Democrats.

He stated that, unlike in some other countries, no one in Scotland resisted the idea that climate change was happening or dragged their heels as they were taken, kicking and screaming, towards the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. I would like to think that I manifested some concerns and did some of the foot-dragging that was necessary during the passage of the bill&#8212;foot-dragging, not knuckle-dragging, of which I will not be accused.</p><p>We established a consensus that climate change is happening, that it was appropriate that Scotland should be a leader in tackling climate change and that we should produce a piece of legislation that would put us at the forefront of dealing with climate change issues. Let us not forget that my party voted for the decision to move from 34 per cent to 42 per cent as the 2020 target, although that was difficult for me to accept.</p><p>The minister described the Copenhagen summit as the time to deliver and the place to commit. I believe that now is the time when we should look back on what has happened in the few short months since we passed the 2009 act and express concerns&#8212;some have already been expressed from the Labour benches&#8212;about how we can make progress.</p><p>The recent announcement of the 2020 group, in which experts will come together to offer their expertise and ideas about how we can make progress, was a great step forward, and I welcome some of the announcements that have been made today. Some of the other proposals that we have heard about today to develop new ideas in Scotland and across the Commonwealth in <place-holder colnum=\"22133\"/> connection with the 2014 games are also welcome. However, we must dig deep and do what is necessary to ensure that we are not simply talking about targets that have been set but may be ignored.</p><p>As we have heard, the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill contained opportunities. I and other members lodged amendments that offered us the opportunity to introduce rebates for the council tax and business rates that would allow individuals in their rented or privately owned homes and small businesses to improve their energy efficiency. I had hoped that that opportunity would have been one of the first that we would take. I am aware that money is available from sources outside the Government to deliver on that in the short term. As a consequence, we need to take every chance to move forward and ensure that we make progress as quickly as possible.</p><p>We have achieved a hard-won consensus in Scotland on climate change; it concerns me that such consensus is not universal in Europe or, indeed, the world. That is why the Copenhagen conference is so important. It is also important that our minister goes to that conference&#8212;whether as part of the national delegation or not&#8212;and explains to the world exactly how Scotland has positioned itself as a world leader in the area.</p><p>However, I have some of the reservations that Patrick Harvie mentioned.

It is important that we take the opportunity to use the chances that the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and the climate change process give us to encourage the involvement of the private sector.</p><p>I believe that the concept of the free market is key to our success and that those who say that the free market cannot achieve our objectives, and that, consequently, we should take a more authoritarian approach, are endangering not only our climate, but our political democracy.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20449504", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was interested to hear Patrick Harvie's comments.

I am tempted to suggest that I may for a long time remember this as the day when Bob Doris told us that ye cannae shove yer granny aff the bus&#8212;something from the depths of Scottish culture that has now been mentioned in the Scottish Parliament for the first time.</p><p>The debate has been a good deal more constructive than it appeared at times it was going to be. With an election not far away, it was inevitable that party politics would creep in. Nevertheless, we have had, in principle at least, broad agreement that the scheme for concessionary travel in Scotland is not perfect and that improvements and adjustments are <place-holder colnum=\"22078\"/> necessary. There were times during the debate when we heard the beginnings of accusations about who had got it wrong and who needs to get it right in the future. I would like to avoid that, if possible.</p><p>As I said in my opening speech, I do not believe that we could have had any hope of getting the scheme right in the first instance. The priorities were to get the scheme in place, to find out what the problems were and then to make changes when knew know what changes would be required. The debate is timely because it has given us the opportunity to examine the list of changes that many of us would like, and to begin to think about how we can prioritise them.</p><p>Earlier in the debate, I asked how we might pay for the changes, which has been raised on several occasions by a number of members. John Park produced an argument that I have heard before, when he asked why the Labour Party should say where the changes in expenditure should be, given that the Conservatives did not say where the cuts in the budget should be to allow our great achievements: the small business rates relief scheme&#8212;for which I am delighted to claim credit, at least in part&#8212;and the town centre regeneration scheme. However, those were negotiated in advance of the passing of a budget and they were new proposals that had to come from other budgets. There was no option. I suggest that there are two options for the concessionary travel scheme, and I would like Labour and the Liberal Democrats to explain which of the options they would choose&#8212;although I believe that the Liberal Democrats have done that, and I will come to them in a minute.</p><p>I would like Labour members to tell us whether they believe that the money to extend the range of the concessionary fares scheme should come from other budgets&#8212;by cutting hospitals, schools or social work&#8212;or whether we should look at the concessionary fares scheme in the round and decide which parts of it are lower priorities, and who should lose entitlement in order that we can extend entitlement to others. I believe that Christopher Harvie began to deal with that. He grasped the nettle and suggested that some people who are entitled to concessionary travel, such as he, could pay. In fact, in evidence to the committee&#8212;I do not have it in front of me, so I cannot quote it directly&#8212;it was suggested that city bankers and businessmen in Edinburgh travel to work using concessionary fares cards and pay nothing to use buses. Some of those people might now be claiming bonuses that could be heavily taxed by the Government.</p><p>We need to reach agreement on entitlement. Ultimately, we must decide whether the age limit of 60, which we currently apply universally, is <place-holder colnum=\"22079\"/> appropriate if the cost of keeping all 60-year-olds within the scheme prevents us from extending it to more deserving groups. I want to promote that discussion. If nothing else comes from the debate today, that will be valuable.</p><p>Other suggestions have been made as to how we could pay for the scheme. Jamie Stone talked about the empty seats on many buses, and found some support for the idea that those seats could be used by passengers who would not pay for them. I am sure that it would be possible for arrangements to be entered into that would allow bus companies to allocate empty space on their buses in such a way; however, the idea that we should rely on the charity of bus companies to achieve our aims is a non-starter.</p><p>We must find some way of paying the costs that are associated with the concessionary fares scheme. Ultimately, if the bus companies chose to allow some people to travel free of charge, it will not be free&#8212;there would still be a cost, which would be moved to other areas of those businesses. Although I am sure that something could be achieved in that area, it is best to keep everything above board and on the balance sheet. In that way, we will know exactly what the costs are.</p><p>Helen Eadie probably did the most to address the issue of cost, which she covered well during her speech. However, I believe that the question that I asked the Labour Party has been answered by the Liberal Democrats. Although I do not believe that their proposals have been costed, as Jim Tolson suggested, the argument that Alison McInnes made for an holistic approach to the cost of the scheme is an implicit indication that she believes that the extra funding should come from outside the scheme itself. That is why I ask the Liberal Democrats again: What, in the future, would they cut to pay for that?</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20449218", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Concessionary Travel Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I remember chamber debates for different reasons at different times.

The things that I am most proud of being involved with in my time in this Parliament are the things on which we agreed.

I see no reason why they should not be covered other than that there is a cost implication that we must take into account. Other problems are associated with the scheme. As has already been pointed out, the introduction of the scheme brought about the removal of many localised schemes and took away opportunities for <place-holder colnum=\"22048\"/> people to take advantage of other concessionary schemes, including concessionary rail travel. We know that many local authorities had the opportunity to put forward or continue with such schemes, which has thrown up numerous problems.

The situation has been called a crisis and a storm, but it is a recession&#8212;the deepest recession since world war two, and one that we are all in together. Some of us like to pass blame around, while others look for a way out.</p><p>To return to Scotland's position in the recession, on unemployment, Scotland is now suffering more than the rest of the United Kingdom. As we move forward, we might struggle to return to the rates of growth that are achieved in other parts of the United Kingdom. That is why I once again repeat my call to the cabinet secretary that, whatever he chooses to do, he should ensure that all public expenditure is used to maximise the recovery in the private sector, to increase the creation of wealth and to change the balance of our economy. That will mean that, as the private sector-fuelled recovery arrives, Scotland will, with each day that passes, be in a better position to take advantage of it.</p><p>We need to be in that better position because, let us face it, Scotland might be a wealthy nation, but it has always had its problems and it still has them. We have areas of poverty in Scotland. We talk repeatedly about difficulties relating to the quality of housing. We need to fight further against child poverty. We have problems associated with fuel poverty, which we all know so well, as a result of increases in fuel prices. That is why I am fundamentally committed to the concept that the <place-holder colnum=\"20725\"/> redistribution of wealth is important. However, too many people in the Parliament and across the political divide concentrate too much on the redistribution of wealth without understanding that the creation of wealth is at least as important, if not more so. That is why, unlike some members, I will say today and repeatedly, that growth is essential to our recovery.</p><p>We have heard that there has been a 6 per cent contraction of the UK economy since the middle of last year. Although we know that the rate of decline has slowed recovery, the definition of recovery is difficult to achieve. In fact, once we have returned to growth, recovery will only just have begun. Not until we make up the drop that we have suffered over the past 18 months and begin to go into net growth over that period will we see the benefits of redistribution once again. My primary demand is that the Government ensures that money spent helps to change the balance of the economy and protects us from the damage that we have suffered.</p><p>In the final moments available to me, I will reflect on some comments from other parties. It was interesting to hear Jeremy Purvis criticise the Government on the areas in which it has decided to cut expenditure. There are some short memories in politics. Jeremy Purvis, who is good at taking the spend, spend, spend approach to politics, is the same man who less than a year ago proposed an &#163;800,000 million cut in Scottish expenditure. There is a wholly inconsistent element in his position that simply takes away credibility from the demands that he has made and continues to make.</p><p>My final remarks must be for the Labour Party. I have sincere sympathy for those on the Labour front bench in the Scottish Parliament. They can criticise, carp and complain about the way in which resources are distributed in Scotland, although they often make constructive suggestions about how it might be done better. However, what they cannot and must not acknowledge&#8212;because they have been told not to&#8212;is that this recession is Gordon Brown's and Labour's recession. The recession is worse here than in any other country in Europe and it is now longer than in any other country in Europe. Above all, this country needs a change of Government.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20275407", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will decline to answer that, because we would have to consider carefully what we mean by a crisis.

We used to discuss them a lot in the Parliament, but we have done so less in recent years. The committee's report gives us an opportunity to look at work that has been done in great depth.</p><p>As a substitute member of the committee, I have attended only one of its meetings&#8212;that which took place in the city chambers in Aberdeen. At the meeting, members were given the opportunity to talk to, question and consult representatives of the Aberdeen-based energy sector, and were reminded that energy is, and has been for many years, one of Scotland's strong suits. I left the discussion with the worry that our oil and gas industry may now be so specialised in its outlook that its appetite to expand into other areas of energy production is not as great as its appetite to expand into oil and gas production in other areas. The minister must face that challenge. There is an enormous amount of expertise here in Scotland. We must ensure that it is used not only to exploit the resources that we know we have but to exploit the resources that, technologically, we must yet find ways of exploiting. Nevertheless, the meeting was a good opportunity for me to see at first hand how the committee works. I commend it on the way in which it conducted its inquiry.</p><p>Today, we have an opportunity to discuss the detail of the report. There is a great deal of common ground on which we all agree. Right at the top of my list of priorities is energy efficiency. <place-holder colnum=\"20110\"/></p><p>As we have heard, energy efficiency is, of course, the easiest way to cut emissions. As members have pointed out&#8212;and deservedly so&#8212;building standards are a key element in achieving energy efficiency over time.</p><p>The committee discussed a range of issues, many of which we agreed on, although the issue that I intend to finish on is one that we may not agree on. Government has admitted the need for baseload capacity in Scotland's electricity generation&#8212;a concession that set an argument running today&#8212;while pursuing carbon capture and storage as the solution. Wendy Alexander and Ross Finnie spoke eloquently on the need for the Government to clarify exactly how, given its preferred solution, it expects to achieve its objectives.</p><p>I will embark on a more general tour of the debate. Members raised extremely important issues, including decentralisation of energy supply, the concept of which I fully support. However, some members confuse the idea: they think that a wind turbine development in the Western Isles or Pentland Firth amounts to decentralisation of energy production, but the two things are not the same. Closing a major power station in central Scotland and replacing it with 500 wind turbines in the north of Scotland is simply centralisation, albeit in another place. Decentralisation is much more than that: it is about placing energy production in the heart of communities. That will allow us to pursue developments such as combined heat and power, which is being done well in Aberdeen and could be done better and more efficiently in other areas of Scotland.</p><p>I was going to say what I am about to say even if Christopher Harvie was not present, but I am delighted that he has returned to the chamber to hear it. From his remarks, it was obvious that Christopher knows that I have noted his tendency to mention Germany. Indeed, in just about every contribution that he makes in the chamber, he mentions Germany. I do not have a problem with that. I simply remarked in a previous debate that I had noted that fact. Germany is a place where there has been great innovation and there have been courageous moves over many years. That has continued even into this very week with the return of a conservative Government.

I join the minister and the previous speaker in commending the present and previous Governments for achieving a great deal in cutting the number of road deaths and injuries in Scotland. That is part of a consistent pattern that we must praise and continue. The targets in the framework document will move us in that direction.</p><p>In the limited time that is available, I will deal with some specifics. First, I have a specific concern about the number of accidents on rural roads. I commend the Liberal Democrats for mentioning that in their amendment. In the north-east of Scotland, we have a noticeable problem with young drivers being involved in accidents, sometimes fatal, on rural roads. It is difficult to target and prevent that problem. The problem must be dealt with through the education of young drivers because, no matter how heavily we police the existing law or any additional legislation that might be put in place, the problem remains that many of the accidents take place in out-of-the-way areas where it is impossible to pre-assess the opportunities.</p><p>A second issue, which has been starkly highlighted in the north-east of Scotland in recent years, is that of school buses. I have an open mind on that and I am willing to support Government action to introduce further legislation if necessary. However, that is with the proviso that legislation is not on its own capable of achieving our objectives. In many accidents, existing legislation was not being observed. Mistakes are made by drivers or, in some cases, by those crossing the road. It must be remembered that there is a degree of individual responsibility and <place-holder colnum=\"19775\"/> that, unfortunately, legislation will never solve the problem.</p><p>The Conservative amendment refers once again to something that has been in many a Conservative manifesto&#8212;our black spot funding proposals. The statement on the draft budget that we heard earlier made it clear that funding for any project, let alone transport projects, will be difficult to identify and achieve in the next few years. That is why my amendment highlights the need to spend any resource that is available, limited though it might be, in a way that saves lives on Scotland's roads. Even with very limited funding, there would still be no shortage of places in which it might be used to prevent accidents. Not least of those is the A90 at Laurencekirk where, last week, another fatal accident took place. Although the accident was not at the junction on which many of us have campaigned for years, it was nearby. The solution to the problem is proper investment that improves safety and achieves good results. That could be done with limited investment, but the opportunity has been missed.</p><p>Scotland is a big country that will always require its people to have access to roads and transport, especially in rural areas. As a consequence, we cannot legislate to prevent people from moving around, but we can educate them to do it more safely.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat amendment contains a proposal to reduce the permissible blood alcohol level. I will suspend judgment on that and will not support the proposal. I believe that the problem in Scotland is not with those who are under the 80mg limit; it is with those who are above that level. Consequently, I do not wish to burden our police force further, given that it appears to be winning the battle at present. As I said, I will suspend judgment on that proposal, but I look forward to discussing it at some time in the future.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-4861.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; notes that ongoing investment in the road network is crucial to making our roads safer, and believes that road spending should be prioritised on the most dangerous black spots and those roads with the highest numbers of accidents and fatalities.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20194125", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Road Safety Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In a short speech in a short debate, I will try to rush through my points.

As we have heard, they offer a great deal to those in Scotland who can benefit from them. I am interested in the argument that there might be a potential economic benefit, not only in relation to indigenous arbitrations, but from the fact that, conceivably, an industry could grow up around international arbitrations. We would all welcome that if it were to come along, but I was glad to hear the minister downplay its significance in his opening speech. The dispute over the figures could have led to confusion. During the debate, members have united around the idea that the numbers are perhaps not as big as we originally hoped that they might be.</p><p>A number of members have referred to several measures that have still to be taken. Of course we need to ensure faster and cheaper arbitration, but more work with consumers will be necessary to ensure that we understand the advantages of low-cost arbitration to everyone. The concern is with ensuring that a modern and accessible arbitration system is in place and that we can take advantage of all that it has to offer.</p><p>The Conservatives will fully support the bill's principles and will take the opportunity to contribute as much as possible to its advancement at later stages.

Some in Parliament are keen to take up the lobbying and encouragement from a range of organisations, including our NGOs, but one of our greatest achievements in the Parliament has been managing to keep competing interests and diverse groups on side and in line with the bill's objectives. If one or two people&#8212;perhaps even those in the public gallery&#8212;are still disappointed at how I or others in the Parliament voted at stage 2 or 3, I say that that was largely to do with the fact that we must serve competing interests and keep them on board with the process.

Amazingly&#8212;although perhaps unsurprisingly&#8212;the photograph found its way into the <em>Holyrood</em> magazine caption competition. It is a measure of how far the Conservative party in Scotland has come that no one entered a caption in which the words \"three rare species\" appeared.</p><p>There has been a great deal of debate today on the nature and specifics of the bill. It is an ambitious bill and it is world-leading legislation. However, we started out on a controversial note in deciding to support the 42 per cent target for 2020, and not the 34 per cent target. For me, that was perhaps the most difficult point of the day. I accepted the figure, as did the Conservative party, in good faith and on the information that the Government brought forward to defend its original decision. We have done the right thing, but I will have to defend the decision in the weeks and months to come. If we proceed properly and appropriately, I believe that the figures are achievable. Indeed, much of what we did following that decision will serve the purpose of taking us towards that target.</p><p>Achievability must be what the bill is about. As I said this morning, I find target setting instinctively difficult&#8212;it is not an approach that I like to take&#8212;but it is inevitable in a bill of this nature that target setting is a key provision. The figures that we agreed on during stage 3 amendments give us the opportunity to make progress against the targets.<place-holder colnum=\"18795\"/></p><p>Another significant decision that we took today was to reinforce the practical measures in the bill to deliver the change that we want. I refer in particular to green council tax discounts. The Conservatives want our power companies, councils and the Scottish Government to work together to make Scotland greener. Until now, Scotland has been losing out on green council tax rebates that, south of the border, range between &#163;50 and &#163;125. An estimated 1.8 million Scottish homes could benefit from such a scheme. Power companies such as British Gas already contribute to the cost in England. We think that it is not fair that Scotland should lose out. We believe that these moves will encourage more households and businesses to go greener. That would mean lower bills for the consumer and help to cut greenhouse gas emissions. I am delighted that our amendment that was agreed to today will extend the possibility of green discounts to businesses across Scotland. In addition to making Scotland greener, once again the Scottish Conservatives have been shown to be a party with creative plans on how to reduce and reform the council tax.</p><p>People will look back on today as a milestone in the process of averting climate change.

Any decisions that were taken by Ms Carlton on breaches of the code were not considered as part of the assessment process, as that would not have been appropriate, given the commissioner's functional independence.

That comes with some sincerity from someone like me, who is from a background where green politics were not as important as they were in other areas. I have paid tribute before to members in the Parliament and those who have taken part in the broader political debate: they have done much to take green politics from the margins of political influence to the heart of policy making. The fact that we are in the chamber to debate the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill at stage 1 is evidence of their success.</p><p>We must now consider the nature of and the need for the legislation. Some members would not have been at all surprised if the Conservatives had in the past taken the position that there was no need to pursue such legislation. In truth, however, the mainstreaming of green policy and the understanding that the climate is changing has driven Conservative thinking as well as that of other political parties. It should therefore come as no surprise that the Conservatives whole-heartedly support the spirit of the bill.</p><p>Similarly, it might not have been a surprise to some if the Conservatives had decided that the right thing to do was to pursue the UK bill rather than separate Scottish legislation. Although we considered that possibility at the outset, two things became clear. First, Scotland is starting from a very different place in relation to climate change and how we deal with it and, secondly, it has a very different level of potential. Consequently, it is only right that Scotland should move ahead with its own legislation.</p><p>The proposal was first introduced in the form of an SNP manifesto commitment during the election campaign, which contained at its heart a target of an 80 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050. One of the first things that I had to do was to assess whether that was an appropriate commitment. At that time, the UK Government was moving towards a 60 per cent reduction by 2050. It was perhaps suspicion on my part that made me think that the Scottish National Party was simply trying to outbid the UK Government with a higher, more ambitious figure, but the fact that the UK Government quickly changed its position to pursue an 80 per cent target indicates that that figure was perhaps more appropriate.<place-holder colnum=\"17104\"/></p><p>One broad issue that arose during the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's inquiry was the question of whether the target is ambitious. The Government is keen to say that 80 per cent is an ambitious target, but some organisations that appeared before the committee suggested that it is not. I suggest that it is an appropriate and ambitious target but only if we take into account genuine short-term measures with regard to how we will achieve it.</p><p>The second most important and significant issue is the decision to go for a 2020 rather than a 2030 target. That 2030 target was, I believe, simply too far in the future and, however ambitious we set it, would not have set the agenda for early progress. Consequently, the Government's decision to pursue a 2020 target is a significant departure.</p><p>It is nonetheless extremely important that we know how that target will be set. The details&#8212;which have been explained by the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change in committee and by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth today&#8212;suggest a 34 per cent target with the option of rising to a 42 per cent target, which is an acceptable path.</p><p>If we are to achieve that, we need short-term targets, and I will continue to seek further clarification from ministers on how those short-term targets will be set and&#8212;more important&#8212;what they are likely to be. If we do not make early progress on annual targets, we will not make the progress that is necessary in the first 10 years.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14962557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the words of Kermit the Frog, \"It's not easy being green\".

Indeed, on the question whether there should be a separate Scottish committee or whether we should rely on the UK Committee on Climate Change, I believe that the UK committee provides an appropriate starting point. The establishment of a separate Scottish committee might be appropriate at some point, but I believe that that time is still some way off. Moreover, given that our targets are broadly similar to UK targets and, more important, feed directly into the achievement of UK targets, I think that we have a great deal to gain by having a common source of advice.</p><p>I am still concerned about one or two key areas. First, given that the bill is two years behind the UK legislation, one might question its relevance. However, that very fact gives us the opportunity to pass more advanced legislation that takes into account figures that were not available when the UK legislation was introduced&#8212;the Government <place-holder colnum=\"17105\"/> has moved some distance towards achieving that. We might also be able to ensure that our legislation contains certain practical measures that can enable greater progress to be made earlier.</p><p>For that reason, I intend to lodge amendments to chapter 3 of part 5, which deals with energy efficiency, to seek not only to allow local authorities to give council tax rebates to households that put in place energy efficiency measures, including cavity wall and loft insulation, but to empower ministers to draw up Scottish Government-funded schemes for council tax and business rate rebates for individuals and businesses who invest in energy-efficient homes, offices, shops and factories. I am aware that in its response to the committee's stage 1 report the Government seems to have dismissed that proposal on the grounds that the council tax should be replaced with something else, but I hope that it will take a more practical and direct route by amending the bill appropriately and ensuring that we deliver genuine financial incentives that allow Scottish householders and businesses to make the necessary changes at an early opportunity. Of course, I am sure that I am not the only member who intends to lodge amendments, and I assure members that any other amendments will receive due consideration and fair treatment from the Conservatives.</p><p>We must move forward together on the bill. Earlier in my speech, I mentioned the apparent bidding war over long-term targets, and I am somewhat disappointed at the prospect of being dragged into another such war as we amend certain parts of the bill. The Conservatives want to make it clear that we are very much part of this process and that we will join other parties in ensuring that, when it is passed and becomes an act of the Parliament, Scotland's legislation will be ambitious, achieve not only the aims and objectives of the general framework but certain practical objectives that allow individuals to contribute to progress, and ensure that Scottish business and local authorities are not unduly burdened by regulation that will in itself do little to cut carbon emissions in Scotland.</p><p>Other Conservative members will address key proposals on forestry, muirburn and waste management. However, in closing, I again assure the Parliament that the Conservatives will consider other parties' amendments that, although broadly acceptable to us, might require more detailed scrutiny in the course of the debate.

The only difference between that and what has happened with our economy is that the economic car crash was not minor.</p><p>I wanted to say some nice things about nice people. The reason why we are where we are is that we have a Government that contains people who have been fundamentally nice; I am talking about the Government in London, not the Scottish Government&#8212;yet. Gordon Brown became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1997 with a golden legacy from a fiscally responsible Conservative Government. In his interim budget in 1997, he was able to set great store by the fact that he had paid back some of the national debt. I hope that he enjoyed that experience, because that was the one and only opportunity he will have to do so.</p><p>What did Gordon Brown do then? He did what every Labour Government does, of course. He set out to improve public services to make everybody's lives a bit better. I offer him and the Labour Government my admiration for having that wonderful aspiration.</p><p>What went wrong? Every year, Gordon Brown's ambition to plough more of the nation's resource into public service always cost slightly more than his budget suggested that it would. Every year, the estimates in his budget statement about the income from a growing economy turned out to be slightly optimistic and he never quite got as much money as he expected. That meant that, year on year, he began to borrow, but just a little. With a quickly growing economy, it is easy to borrow just a little. Year on year, Gordon Brown borrowed against future growth for the benefit of us all.</p><p>In Scotland, we had no shortage of examples of more and more public money coming north, and we in the Parliament decided how best to spend that money. The problem was that, every year, the increases were based on slightly more borrowing, which was based on consistent growth.

We took evidence from the 2M Group, which represents councils and other public bodies in the west end of London and is motivated primarily by the need to cut the number of aircraft movements over the city of London.

I assure members that even those of us who are in the Conservative party have whiled away many a wee small hour debating what she actually meant. However, I believe that she meant that what we call society is simply the sum of what we contribute as individuals towards it. I believe that, during earth hour, we will prove that what we achieve together is the sum of our individual acts of accountability. That is what earth hour is for me.</p><p>If earth hour teaches other people that they, too, should be accountable, that is a good thing. It will also be good if it teaches bigger organisations in the public and private sectors the same thing. I am delighted to hear that local authorities all over Scotland, including Aberdeenshire Council, which covers the area that I live in, will be participating in some way in earth hour. However, I often wonder, when I am passing council buildings on a Saturday evening in the dark, why they require to be so well lit up. Might it not save the hard-pressed council tax payer a little money if the council just switched the lights out more often? I also wonder why our motorway system is lit up through rural Scotland on some of the dark mornings on which I have driven on it. The reality is that there is much more that we could do, but public opinion needs to be worked on if we are to achieve those aims.</p><p>I thank Shirley-Anne Somerville once again for bringing this matter to my attention and giving me the opportunity to commit publicly to supporting it. <place-holder colnum=\"16344\"/></p><p>I hope that we can all learn a little from doing a little together.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14898813", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Earth Hour 2009"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Shirley-Anne Somerville for lodging the motion for debate.

Scotland might appear to be doing rather better than the rest of the United Kingdom at this stage in the economic downturn because our unemployment is not so high, our growth remains slightly higher, and our descent into recession seems to be on a much slower trajectory. However, I have a concern that the reason for those figures is that Scotland's economy is more dependent on the public sector than the economy in the rest of the UK is. That underpinning by public resource might slow our rate of progress into recession, but future projections must take into account the fact&#8212;as many of us now admit&#8212;that less public money than we would like will be available to us in the recovery phase. The danger is that, having descended more slowly into recession, we will have a significantly slower ascent out of it.</p><p>For that reason, in looking at how Scotland's economy can best recover, the Government has a clear duty to consider how best to invest the limited resources that are available to ensure that we are not late recoverers from the recession. I have heard much to encourage me today, given that both John Swinney and John Park talked about how we might use money from the public purse to underpin the development of private enterprise in the recovery phase when, once its confidence is restored, private enterprise will willingly go ahead with borrowing and investing to create genuine jobs for that recovery.</p><p>What do we need to do? As several others have said, infrastructure is key. The limited resources that are available at this difficult stage must go towards infrastructure, which will then be present to underpin the recovery when it comes. Yes, that means roads and bridge, but it also means schools and other public buildings. The opportunity should be taken&#8212;and taken urgently&#8212;to use our resources to ensure that those who would otherwise have no job are kept in work preparing our infrastructure for recovery. I need not repeat that the failure of the Scottish Futures Trust to deliver the resources necessary <place-holder colnum=\"16300\"/> to push forward those projects will be written as an epitaph across this Government if it falls.</p><p>We have also heard about green jobs. I am very interested in them, and I genuinely believe that a massive number could be created. A number of such opportunities exist, but let me take this opportunity to highlight one problem that we could see recur in future.</p><p>This week, I met Mr Alistair Kerr of the Wood Panel Industries Federation. He was concerned about the increasing use of wood-fired biomass in Scotland. We all know&#8212;and I agree&#8212;that such use is a good thing. Last year I joined the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth at Macphie of Glenbervie, where he formally opened a large woodchip boiler that is being fired by wood from local timber. That is exactly the type of thing that we want to encourage.</p><p>The problem is that, if we also want sustainable construction of highly energy-efficient houses in Scotland, we will need those raw materials. Mr Kerr told me that, since the advent of biofuel-fired or woodchip boilers, the cost of his industry's raw material has gone up by a factor of three or more. If our industry cannot compete in that environment, the raw materials that the people whom we put to work use to build energy-efficient houses might come in from abroad.</p><p>Such problems, which involve a situation in which one industry is supported and succeeds while another is damaged by the same action, will have to be addressed by the Government at every stage of the development with which we are going ahead. We need to progress a return to stability for Scotland's economy, but the private sector is essential to that recovery.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14898714", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporting Economic Recovery"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Not at the moment.

I am a member of that committee, and I <place-holder colnum=\"15545\"/> would like to discuss a couple of issues, based on our experience.</p><p>Any Government that introduces any kind of national planning framework opens a can of worms that leads to the kind of criticism and debate that we are seeing today. Once any list is drawn up, there will be no shortage of politicians who believe that some things have been included that should not be included, and that some things are not included that should be included. So here we are, having the debate.</p><p>Following the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's inquiry and the evidence that we heard, I feel that some question marks hang over the consultation and participation. I will not take a position on either side of the argument; all I will say is that opinions were expressed about both the effectiveness and the lack of effectiveness of the consultation process. Rather than panic about that, politicians and the Government should continue to consider what a consultation process should be. Previous Governments have gone to great lengths to consult to death about everything. We have now evolved a structure for consultation. It seems to follow a recognisable and acceptable pattern, but, in the end, just as many people as ever feel that they have not been consulted. Perhaps we rely too often on the usual suspects.</p><p>Getting people to participate in consultations&#8212;ordinary people who will suffer from the disadvantages or benefit from the advantages of any decisions&#8212;continues to be as difficult as ever. I ask the minister to take seriously the comments on consultation in the Local Government and Communities Committee's report, and in the contributions to it from the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee.</p><p>Moving on&#8212;and to participate in the same old arguments about what should and should not be on the list of national developments&#8212;I must mention high-speed rail. I do so not only because it is mentioned in the Labour Party amendment, but because in recent months it has become a topic of considerable discussion in the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee and beyond.</p><p>The need to develop high-speed rail is, of course, of national importance in a United Kingdom context. High-speed rail links from London to central Scotland are as important for the people of London as they are for the people of central Scotland. The links will displace air travel between the two points, thus improving the quality of the environment at both ends of the railway line, not only here in Scotland.</p><p>I understand the point that the Labour Party makes in its amendment, and I am happy to <place-holder colnum=\"15546\"/> support it, if for no other reason than to ensure that high-speed rail is made a higher priority than it has been. The Conservative party supports that basic change in thinking.</p><p>Another point that came out in evidence to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee was that there is inconsistency between some of the objectives in NPF 2 and the climate change objectives that the Government has expressed generally and specifically in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill, which the committee is currently considering. I do not object to there being inconsistencies, because, in the present difficult economic times, there may be more than one example of situations in which we have to choose between our climate change imperatives and the need for short-term recovery in the Scottish economy. However, I object to a Government that denies that a choice is being made and then tries to steer away from that particular argument.</p><p>There is no better example of that than the Government's clear decision to pursue clean coal technology&#8212;by suggesting that there should be coal-fired power stations with carbon capture readiness, whatever that means&#8212;rather than consider replacing our nuclear power stations. It is wholly inappropriate that that decision is clearly written in the framework document.

What an excellent day for the Conservatives. We must remember that it was a Conservative motion, back in December, that secured the necessary majority support to oppose the Government's proposals. I am delighted that action is being taken on the issue today, although it is an amazing move by the cabinet secretary to announce it at this point. These debates are usually boring, but, as he sat down, I could hear the sound of speeches being torn up all around the chamber as members put away their speeches from last year and started to think about what they were going to say about this year's budget and the speech that they had just heard.</p><p>It was interesting to hear from the cabinet secretary what his plans were. He announced that he was to end the policy of pursuing local income tax, which I believe is a sensible decision that should be commended. Of course, it is a pity that the policy has been dropped only for this session, but we live to fight another day. However, there are one or two things that I would like to know about what he has suggested.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has said that he will extend the freeze in council tax up to 2011-12. The Conservatives have been saying recently that the resources that had been allocated&#8212;around &#163;280 million, I believe&#8212;to lubricate the transition to local income tax could have been used simply to cut the level of income tax, which would reduce the burden on people across Scotland. It is interesting that John Swinney announced the extension of the freeze at the same time as announcing the dropping&#8212;however temporary&#8212;of his local income tax policy. Is that &#163;280 million, which he had allocated for the introduction of local income tax, still available, or is that the money that he has used to extend the council tax freeze until 2011-12? If the latter is the case, we can draw the conclusion that the real reason why ministers have dropped their local income tax policy is that, privately, the Government is aware of how expensive it would be to introduce the tax and agrees with the Conservatives that it simply cannot afford to do so.</p><p>The reform of local government taxation is a priority for the Conservatives and although our view on how that might be achieved might differ from that of the Government, we remain open-minded on how it can be achieved.</p><p>We also remain open-minded about how we can achieve a fairer distribution of tax across Scotland. I look forward to hearing more from the minister on that matter. The north-east of Scotland&#8212;in particular, Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council&#8212;receives a distinctly smaller share of revenue support per capita than other parts of Scotland. I suspect that that is <place-holder colnum=\"14915\"/> because a redistributive mechanism is being used to take resource out of the area&#8212;with its higher average council tax payments and higher average banding&#8212;and place it in other parts of Scotland.</p><p>I want to discuss another issue that the Conservatives have spoken about for some time and on which we want there to be a little more Government action: the effect that some of the reduction in revenue has had on the north-east, particularly in relation to schools in Aberdeenshire.</p><p>Ten days ago, an article in a Sunday paper described at length the problems that are being faced by many schools in Scotland. Apparently, 134 schools have been classified as grade D, which means that they are economically extinct. A breakdown of the figures showed that 37 of those schools had been or were about to be replaced and that 12 of them were due to be replaced in 2010 to 2016. The breakdown also showed that there were no plans to do anything with 85 of them. It is worrying that 45 of those 85 schools are in Aberdeenshire, including Glenbervie primary school in Drumlithie, where I received my primary education, where my children received their primary education and where the first of my grandchildren is now a pupil.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14705327", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Order 2009"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Another day, another debate, and another Tory   initiative adopted by the Government.

Earlier this week, our informal discussions with a number of other parties on what our amendment could be were simply in the context of a transport debate. Today, one day after the budget debate, we have a whole different context. I intend to touch on that, as well as on transport issues, in the limited time that is available to me.</p><p>I repeat some of the calls that we have made previously. We believe that the strategic transport projects review, when it was published served a purpose as far as it went, and we were delighted that it had come along. The problem was one of prioritisation. Priority number 1 was the new Forth road bridge. Priority number 2 was everything else, whenever the Government could get round to finding ways to fund it. I therefore repeat my call to the Government to proceed from the publication of the strategic transport projects review, to prioritise properly, to develop timescales and to discuss funding mechanisms to put the projects in place over time.</p><p>The Conservatives will continue to work, in a general sense, with any and all political parties in <place-holder colnum=\"14508\"/> Parliament to further the aim of evolving and developing the trunk road network. We know that large improvements are required all over Scotland, and they need to be delivered when they can be afforded. Although budget considerations and funding mechanisms will inevitably play a part in what we can do and when we can do it, we are prepared to explore every possible funding mechanism and arrangement that could be put in place to achieve those aims.</p><p>As I look through the motion and amendments, I conclude that the context must be taken into account. I agree that the roads that need to be improved that have been included in the motion are very much the ones that we need to deal with, and I agree with the Liberal Democrat amendment that the A90 should perhaps also have been included. I even agree with some elements of Stewart Stevenson's amendment, but we must take the context into account.</p><p>During the budget debate yesterday, I did not hear from Labour members that improving the trunk road network was among its priorities. Having voted against the budget bill, they have effectively reduced the transport budget for next year&#8212;unless something can be done&#8212;by &#163;217.5 million. As a consequence of that, it is difficult to take into account the position that Labour has taken today.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat amendment makes no mention of the Elgin bypass, which has been that party's priority in previous debates, including last week. I look forward to hearing the opening Liberal Democrat speech and to finding out whether it features quite as strongly as it did on previous occasions. It must be taken into account that, yesterday, the Liberal Democrats once again demanded an &#163;800 million per annum cut in Scottish public expenditure. What they have said on transport indicates that they have no intention of taking that amount off capital expenditure, and they have expressed on many occasions the view that it should actually increase, rather than decrease. Their proposal would require an annual cut approaching 6 per cent in revenue spending across Scotland. How can the Liberal Democrats have a list of spending commitments that include investment in road and rail infrastructure, but which do not take into account that proposed cut? There is simply an imbalance in the Liberal Democrats' approach.</p><p>I accept much of what is in the motion and the amendments.

I believe that we need to commit to significant levels of carbon or climate change gas reduction over the next few years, but for us to succeed as a Parliament and a country, that must go hand in hand with measures to underpin economic growth. I will not accept any argument that diverges from that position. I am prepared to commit to the idea that we must both maintain economic growth and cut emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, but I am concerned about how that can be realised.</p><p>Some of the documents that have been published recently contain one or two statements that help to crystallise the decisions that we need to make in the coming years. I offer a simple quote from the national planning framework 2 document to illustrate the fact that the Government is prepared to consider some fairly worthwhile options. On the generation of electricity, paragraph 150 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Given the variable output of some renewable sources of energy, large baseload power stations will have a role to play in maintaining the stability of electricity supply for some time ahead. While important elements of Scotland's existing baseload generating capacity are scheduled to close over the next 10 years, extensions to the lives of coal-fired and nuclear power stations are possible.\"</p><p>I welcome the fact that the Government acknowledges that nuclear has a role to play in the near future, at least. However, I will address first the issue of coal-fired stations, which I will broaden out to include all fossil-fuelled thermal stations. NPF 2 sets out a clear case for the employment of carbon capture or clean coal technology, but when the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee took evidence on the issue, we were interested to discover that a number of non-governmental organisations concerned with environmental matters have a <place-holder colnum=\"14284\"/> significant lack of faith in the technology's ability to meet the need for Scotland to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions in the near future. Their concern is that the technology is not mature. Even if it could be retrofitted to existing or soon-to-be-built coal-fired power stations, there is a danger that we would leave ourselves with huge storage problems for captured carbon dioxide that could not be disposed of in a long-term or permanent way. Where have we heard that before?</p><p>If we genuinely need to provide base-load capacity&#8212;as I believe we do&#8212;to balance the pursuit of renewables, to which the Parliament is committed, we must be sure about how can do so without emitting carbon. The obvious answer is through nuclear generation. When we talk about power in general terms, we are always reminded that energy efficiency is worth pursuing and that there is a need for much more power than simply electricity. However, some of the policy decisions that we have made in recent years and are about to make mean that, although overall energy consumption could fall, the requirement for electricity will rise, as we travel by electric trains and begin to plug in our cars in the evening to recharge them overnight&#8212;that may just happen. We need carbon-free base-load capacity, and we need to use technology that we know works.</p><p>Scotland has already had two generations of nuclear power stations. The first generation was dirty, created large volumes of waste and gave us problems that we will be dealing with for many years to come. The second generation was much better&#8212;the stations were cleaner, more efficient and more reliable. However, in recent years we have realised that, as they become older, they are subject periodically to unexpected shutdown. That is why the Government should do more than simply commit to using our existing nuclear capacity. We need to commit&#8212;now&#8212;to the third generation of nuclear power stations in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621968", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill: Stage 3: \"First Annual Report of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers: December 2008\" (Scottish Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "To repeat a line that Hugh Henry used just seconds ago, economic blight is the last thing that we need, but economic blight is what we have.

However, the discovery of engineering problems in the Forth bridge focused the minds of members of the Scottish Parliament, other politicians and engineers alike on how to deal with the matter should the problems become insurmountable.</p><p>Members have presented those engineering issues in a number of different ways. I was glad to hear Helen Eadie mention Alastair Andrew, the former bridge master who has now retired. In the past, I was lucky enough to meet him on more than one occasion. He is one of the greatest sources of information on the bridge and on the dangers that lie ahead.</p><p>We have heard much about the biggest single problem that faces us: corrosion in the bridge cables. We are told that the dehumidification process appears to be working. However, unlike some who believe that that process may reverse corrosion in the cables, the Conservatives believe that that will not happen. If we can slow down the rate of corrosion, we will extend the lifespan of the bridge, but dehumidification will neither reverse the corrosion nor repair it.</p><p>As a consequence, the current problems with the bridge will not go away. There is also the on-<place-holder colnum=\"14126\"/> going problem with wires in the cables snapping not as a result of corrosion but because the process of rolling the wires to form the cables over 40 years ago may have been flawed. In addition, there is the potential problem of the anchorage points. The problem is not yet fully understood, but there are engineering risks in that regard that may yet cause us to consider bridge replacement.</p><p>The bridge is flawed and will continue to suffer from on-going damage, not only because of its construction method but because of increased traffic volumes. There is a choice that we have to make. Des McNulty described it as a paradox, and I agree with his interpretation. The paradox is this: do we go ahead and build a bridge in the knowledge that it may be required, or do we wait until we know that a new bridge is required and then begin to build a new one? The members who contributed to the debate fall into two distinct groups: those who believe that we should wait and see and those who believe that we should go ahead now and plan for a new bridge. In that respect, the Government has our full support.</p><p>Deciding on the option of building a lower-priced bridge and making extensive multimodal use of the existing bridge has resulted in a significant cost reduction, which makes it a worthwhile option to pursue. However, given what members have said in the chamber today, we must look further at the multimodal option. Some individuals take the extraordinary line of saying, \"We do not need another bridge but, if we are to have one, can we have the expensive option?\"&#8212;I know that because I have spoken to them. The argument is not only extraordinary but irrational. When I come across it, I dismiss it.</p><p>However, in many of the profound speeches in the debate, members said that, if we are to build the bridge, the multimodal option should be involved. I have this to say to those who believe in a new multimodal bridge: before going down that road, we must consider the cost and the impact of the cost. The Conservatives are not prepared to commit to the much higher level of expenditure that a multimodal bridge would require when the option of reusing the existing bridge to provide that multimodal option is ahead of us.</p><p>We know that challenges lie ahead of us. As the new bridge is completed and traffic is moved off the existing bridge, the challenge will be to refurbish and rebuild elements of the existing bridge. That challenge lies in the future&#8212;indeed, it will lie further in the future if we agree now on replacing the existing bridge. If we build the replacement, the old bridge's lifespan will be considerably increased, which gives us options for the future.</p><p>We have had an extensive debate today on funding and funding mechanisms. I believe that, <place-holder colnum=\"14127\"/> on balance, the cabinet secretary has clearly stated how the bridge will be funded, and that the funding for the bridge will be in place. However, the cabinet secretary has not accounted for how the massive gap in capital will be filled once the huge elephant in the room, the new Forth bridge, has taken up its place. Time has gone by, and we know how the bridge will be funded, but we do not know how the funding will be replaced within capital budgets.</p><p>There are calls for various things in the amendments. It is ironic that two of them, those from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, seem to take out the commitment not to toll the new bridge.

Expenditure on transport is underpinned by this budget. Like me, many people who are concerned about transport have spent the past month talking about issues such as the strategic transport projects review and the national planning framework. I have concerns about how some of the projects in the strategic transport projects review will be prioritised and funded. I also have concerns about how we will fund some of the projects in the national planning framework. However, we must remember that those projects are plans for the future and will be dealt with under future spending reviews and budgets.</p><p>The Government is taking the correct action by bringing forward planned expenditure wherever possible. That is worthy of support, because it is the right way to use public money at this time of crisis, as we get twice the value. In the intermediate term, when we are trying to create jobs in a marketplace that is destroying them no matter how hard we try to prevent that happening, it is important to preserve our important construction industry by ensuring that the jobs that we want it to do anyway are done as early as possible. That will create work and opportunities, and ensure that we have the infrastructure that will <place-holder colnum=\"13949\"/> enable Scotland to bounce back from this disastrous recession as quickly as possible.</p><p>We must welcome the opportunities that are presented to us and the decisions that have been taken in that regard.

It is, therefore, essential that future budgets&#8212;and, certainly, the next spending review&#8212;identify budgetary proposals to complement the challenging legislative emissions targets that are about to be introduced.</p><p>The committee also expressed the desire that, in future, there should be a demonstrable shift towards policy priorities that are specifically designed to contribute to the radical reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and which otherwise address climate change.

Of course, at that time, road transport was our highest priority.

For a long time, the Conservative group in the Scottish Parliament has believed that a new&#8212;replacement&#8212;Forth crossing is the single biggest transport priority in Scotland, and last year we were pleased to be able to assist the new Government in moving the project forward as a priority. However, although we agreed with the principles behind the decisions that were made, we were always concerned about the price that was attached to the project. We welcome the fact that today the minister has presented a proposal that is streamlined, both physically and financially, and which will deliver an affordable project that can put in place within an appropriate timescale a bridge to support the economy of Scotland.</p><p>It is interesting that, after talking about the costings for the bridge, the minister mentioned the <place-holder colnum=\"13215\"/> Scottish Futures Trust.

I come from an extremely rural area&#8212;the kind of area where everyone seeks to get a driving licence as soon as they are 17, so that they may become mobile in a way that they were not previously. I had that experience, which was repeated by members of my family when they reached the required age. Because I live on a farm, and my son was the person in his peer group with a tractor, he got the job of bringing back wreckage from the roadside&#8212;he had a shed behind which he could hide it. Thankfully, none of his friends was killed or seriously injured in any of the accidents, but the experience made clear to me how many accidents involving young and inexperienced drivers take place. It also gave me strong opinions on the matter. Although I agree with most of what has been said already, I hope to make one or two additional points.</p><p>The first relates to young girls who, as newly qualified drivers, may be less enthusiastic and <place-holder colnum=\"13181\"/> slightly more timid than others. Friends of my daughter have told me that they have experienced intimidation on the roads. People who should know better victimise inexperienced drivers who are more timid in nature and cause them difficulty. We should not be prepared to put up with that.</p><p>It appears that we have a particular problem in the north-east. I may be wrong, but I read the north-east papers which, as we heard earlier, always contain reports of deaths and injuries associated with young and inexperienced drivers. Many accidents are caused by the frustration that arises on roads where slow-moving traffic is a problem, as difficulty in overtaking can provoke people into taking action that they should not take. I welcome the news that there will be further investment in some single-carriageway roads in the north-east&#8212;I hope that that will deliver a change.</p><p>I was not going to mention alcohol, but I heard it mentioned in an earlier speech, and I agree that we should reduce the limit for everyone. I know that there are difficulties with measuring consumption and securing a prosecution because it is necessary to have a line in the sand over which we can prove that the person has stepped, but the technology that is now available to us makes it possible to enforce a much lower limit than we have at present. We should move towards doing that.</p><p>I do not want to discourage young people from driving. I want them to take driving seriously. One problem that we have is that it is difficult to work out who is likely to be vastly overconfident and take their new driving licence, jump into a car and go off and do something stupid. It is an almost impossible task to select those people, because they are in fact the best drivers who go through the instruction and testing process. They are the most likely to pass their driving test at the first attempt&#8212;and then they go off and become involved in a serious accident.</p><p>We must do more in schools. It is my personal view and not my party's, but I have suggested that the right thing to do is not to increase to 18 the age at which someone can hold a licence but to permit 16 and 17-year-olds to drive while accompanied and under instruction. In that way, we can guarantee that they have a year of instruction before they pass their test. In addition, most pupils in Scotland would spend that year at school, and we could use the opportunity that schools provide to teach them proper road manners and ensure that they understand the risks. We could also perhaps identify the one or two individuals who might go out and do something stupid.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14290196", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young Drivers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Alison McInnes for bringing the IAM report to the attention of Parliament and for securing today's debate.

I understand why he said that&#8212;I suspect that it was not just because the SNP Government has some responsibility for what <place-holder colnum=\"12986\"/> happens next, but because he did not want to talk about the Labour Government's record down in Westminster. However, I will take a leaf out of Malcolm's book&#8212;I apologise, Presiding Officer; I meant Malcolm Chisholm's book&#8212;and discuss the SNP Government first.</p><p>It must be said that the options that are in the Scottish Government's hands are limited&#8212;rightly so, I would argue&#8212;but the limited sums of money that it has brought forward today pale into insignificance beside the hundreds of billions or even trillions of pounds to which our national debt has risen. However, the Scottish Government has some power and some resources that it must use. The bringing forward of capital expenditure has an important part to play in seeing Scotland through these difficult times.</p><p>Despite that, we have seen over a period of time that the Scottish Government has had some difficulty in putting together focused plans, including its plans for the Scottish Futures Trust through which it will bring forward the additional investment that can be levered in. I ask the Government to assure us today that it will move quickly to ensure that it can lever in those funds in the shortest possible timescale. If it does that, we will avoid the accusation in the long term that the money was there but we did not use it effectively.</p><p>We should also welcome the range of proposals&#8212;including those to address the key issues of housing and fuel poverty&#8212;that the Government put forward today. It is also bringing forward a number of roads projects, and I look forward to the further proposals that we will see in next week's strategic transport projects review.</p><p>Having dealt with issues that relate to the Government in Scotland, I cannot fail to return to the Government south of the border, which has caused so many of the problems. The truth is that we got a Labour Government that had its heart in the right place and which brought forward ambitious spending plans that were to be funded by equally ambitious forecasts of income and revenue. However, every project that it put in place seemed to cost a little bit more than the estimate, and every move to increase taxation also fell slightly short. As a result, borrowing started to grow, and grow quickly. The then Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8212;Gordon Brown&#8212;sought to fuel a high street spending boom. We went out and spent money that we borrowed on our credit cards and by other means, 17.5 per cent of which&#8212;borrowed though it was&#8212;went straight to the chancellor. That revenue served only to fuel his appetite for more and more expenditure.</p><p>Now we know the difficulties that have resulted from the circumstances that we face. We know that the Government is again borrowing against ambitious forecasts to stimulate house purchases <place-holder colnum=\"12987\"/> and high street spending. Our present chancellor has said that a solution must be found to the difficulties that we face, and the solution that he has put forward is more borrowing.</p><p>Alistair Darling may be right. He may have hit on the right way to achieve a route out of this unprecedented crisis. Nevertheless, he is taking a huge gamble. He is like the gambler at the roulette table who, having kept on betting, has kept on losing and whose pile of chips is getting smaller and smaller as time goes by. With nothing left to deliver, he has hocked everything he has left and put it all on one last gamble. He is gambling that, by borrowing to tide us over, he can get us back into a positive economy. As I have said, the Conservatives disagree. Alistair Darling may or may not be right&#8212;only time will tell. If he is wrong, this country will never recover from his mistake.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14282882", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pre-budget Report (Scottish Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Many members developed their political philosophies at a particular point in their lives; I suggest that many of us developed them during what we might loosely describe as our youth.

As her colleague Mary Mulligan mentioned, we have had a legislation-light session of Parliament. I am sure that some new members have been here for 18 months and are not entirely familiar with the bill process. I thank Jackie Baillie for making progress on that, at least. However, I qualify that statement by suggesting to the Government that returning to the approach that the Labour Party took in the first two sessions might be a slight overreaction.</p><p>I welcome the bill. As I am not a member of the Local Government and Communities Committee and did not go through the evidence until I read the committee's report, I have been informed by today's debate. One of the more interesting figures that we have heard is that 4.5 per cent of the population of Scotland hold a blue badge. That figure is much higher than I expected it to be&#8212;it means that all of us will know someone who has a blue badge and many of us will be related to someone who has one. The issue touches us all in many ways.</p><p>Some time ago, my mother, who is now a blue badge holder, found out a bit about the misuse of parking restrictions when she and my daughter went shopping&#8212;as it happens, at an Asda store. They used a mother-and-child parking space, and my mother was horrified because my daughter <place-holder colnum=\"12768\"/> was driving the car. That indicates that we have a problem with getting some younger members of society to take such restrictions seriously.</p><p>An early part of the debate centred on the abuse of disabled parking spaces and why that has become necessary. I was interested in Jackie Baillie's story about a young man driving a red BMW, and equally interested in Hugh Henry's speed in jumping in to intervene, which made me wonder whether he owns a red BMW too. However, he made a sensible point. Perhaps there are too many disabled spaces in some modern supermarket car parks. A problem may exist if that causes people to take a blas&#233; approach and abuse such spaces. I do not support Hugh Henry's position, but there is an issue that should be addressed.</p><p>Duncan McNeil's extremely well-researched speech has been the most informative and interesting in the debate. He spoke about the problem of the obvious abuse of disabled parking spaces and used a phrase that will stick in my memory and which has already been repeated: he said that the age of courtesy or politeness is over and that the age of enforcement has begun.</p><p>The Conservatives firmly believe that the bill is necessary. Of course, we are the party that habitually believes that legislation should not be the first port of call and should not be used unnecessarily to force people to behave in a particular way. However, we have had disabled parking spaces and blue badges that show that a person is entitled to use a disabled parking space in Scotland for a long time. The experiment has now run its course; the time for legislation has come.</p><p>I was interested in Duncan McNeil's suggestion that evidence that has been presented may show that those who abuse disabled parking spaces are more likely to offend in other ways. That indicates to me that we have a broader problem in Scotland. The failure to enforce what we may see as relatively trivial legislation simply encourages people to take a poor attitude towards observing the law at any level, which does not serve our society at all. For that reason, I support what has been proposed.</p><p>David McLetchie set out the Conservatives' position and his three tests. His first test was whether the problem justifies legislative intervention. What I have said so far indicates that we believe that legislation is appropriate. However, he qualified what he said by saying that amendments to the bill may be necessary to ensure that things are dealt with in an appropriate way.</p><p>David McLetchie's second test was whether the proposals are likely to achieve the desired <place-holder colnum=\"12769\"/> practical result. He showed that there are alternative ways of achieving such aims, including going down the route of United Kingdom-wide legislation. However, as we have heard, the only opportunity to introduce legislation through the Scottish Parliament may be the course that has been taken so far. For that reason, I am willing to support the route that is being taken.</p><p>The final test is the cost of the proposed remedy. We must consider the costs in detail, as they are a problem. Several members have discussed the wide range of estimated costs to local authorities. There is an expectation that something to deal with the abuse of disabled parking spaces can be achieved legislatively at a reasonable cost throughout Scotland, but a problem must be addressed, as different local authorities have come up with wildly differing cost estimates. As the bill progresses towards stages 2 and 3, the Conservatives will need to have a much clearer view of what the costs will be. We look forward to those costs being discussed in another forum.</p><p>In conclusion, the Conservatives accept that the bill is justified and so will agree to its general principles at 5 o'clock.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271268", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jackie Baillie on introducing any kind of legislation.

It has been most interesting to hear the complaints from Labour and Liberal Democrat members about how we have turned our backs on the mechanism that they used to use. Of course, that is not true of the Conservatives&#8212;we still believe that those mechanisms are effective, but there is a certain irony to those complaints when we consider the record of the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party in opposition in Westminster. Labour was fervently opposed to PFI and said that it would deal with the problem when it arrived in office. Well&#8212;when it arrived in office it evolved the PPP system, which was&#8212;give or take some&#8212;almost indistinguishable from the mechanism that it replaced.</p><p>However, that evolutionary approach is reasonable. It was and remains a concern for us that the new Government in Scotland has decided to progress several new funding mechanisms to replace PPP. The problem is that time is passing as the system evolves and we get more news about how it will operate: 19 months have elapsed since the election of this Government and, in spite of the unbridled enthusiasm of members such as Alex Neil, there is without doubt a hiatus in the investment that is required for projects that would <place-holder colnum=\"12442\"/> have been funded by PPP. In my backyard, a Liberal Democrat and Conservative council is looking for funding for new secondary schools in places such as Laurencekirk and Kemnay. The council is ready to take advantage of a mechanism once one is presented to it, but no mechanism seems to be available, as yet.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis expressed legitimate concerns about the amount of money that is being invested in setting up the SFT. However, the fact that the SNP set itself ideologically against PPP, but has now begun to progress towards something that is almost indistinguishable from it, means that this is something that we need to encourage the Government to get on with. The problem is that we have not made progress.</p><p>We must make the scheme attractive to investors. If we rule out incentives for investors, there will be no investment. The sooner we have an attractive project and an attractive scheme that will encourage investors and investment in our infrastructure development, the sooner we will have something that will work.</p><p>As the Conservatives have said consistently, we will evaluate proposals on their merit, because value for money is more important than ideology. Although much detail is still to be produced, two points are clear: the SFT will advise on PPP projects and in 2010 a new private futures trust will be established to provide private investment. It will be interesting to see how the left wingers among the SNP back benchers react to that&#8212;I will be particularly keen to hear Bill Wilson's reaction.</p><p>The SFT has changed from the original plans: it is not what it was in the SNP's manifesto, nor is it what it was in the consultation paper. However it is dressed up, the key principle of PFI or PPP is maintained: the levering in of private investment in public infrastructure. Concerns remain about aspects of the Government's proposals, including the length of time before the SFT starts to commission real projects. The current estimate is that it will do so in 2009 at the earliest. Furthermore, there are no details of exactly how investment will be raised from the private sector, with the exception&#8212;of course&#8212;of use of the non-profit-distributing model of PPP.</p><p>Let us move the SFT forward. Why does the Government not consider the option of putting in place a choice? It should allow those who are choosing to invest public money to let the market decide what gives best value for money.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that today we need public investment more than we have at any time during the 10 years of the Scottish Parliament. The actions of this Government in setting itself ideologically against PPP have created a delay in delivery of projects, which may <place-holder colnum=\"12443\"/> occur now or in the future.

One or two other things have to be said. I still receive letters from enthusiastic and&#8212;it would appear&#8212;honest individuals, who believe that climate change is not the issue that we believe that it is. In all honesty, given the current economic situation, even if there was no carbon benefit to the proposals in Sarah Boyack's bill, the contribution that it would make to alleviating fuel poverty and overcoming the economic difficulties that so many families in Scotland face would in itself mean that it was appropriate for us to support it. We are talking about a genuine win-win situation.</p><p>We need to work hard on a number of areas. We still have progress to make on the implementation of microgeneration measures. Microgeneration opportunities in our towns, particularly where strict planning controls exist, are still difficult to encourage and hard to take through the planning process. Planning regulations do not need to be changed, but how local authorities implement those regulations in some areas discourages the investment that could happen, even today.</p><p>Such investment is becoming more and more important. As I said, we are entering an economic downturn. Opportunities must be found to create worthwhile employment and to invest Government and private money in measures that will make the world more economically justified, particularly in Scotland, where the weather is still cold, despite global warming. Such opportunities are presented by the chance to make a limited investment that will encourage the development of energy efficiency measures, microgeneration and renewables in domestic and light industrial settings and will give us a new industry that could create new jobs when they are needed more than ever.</p><p>It would be inappropriate to end my speech without paying tribute to the Green party for its work to put such issues at the centre of the agenda.

Some of the best speeches and debates in this Parliament happen when someone has the courage to mention Karl Marx and Margaret Thatcher in the same speech; today, we heard the speech I was waiting for. There was much in the speech that I disagree with, but I mention it because there was so much in it that I agree with, and that is what I will concentrate on.</p><p>During a recession, Scotland has a huge opportunity to benefit from infrastructure developments. It is not as if we have to invent the projects, because a huge number of infrastructure projects are lying waiting for adequate funding and the necessary drive to push them through. In fact, the lack of that drive has been a problem.</p><p>One problem, particularly in the development of Scottish Water's infrastructure programme, has been that desperation to move forward has actually blocked development, because of the resulting excessive inflation in the construction and civil engineering sectors in recent years. I might be clutching at straws but, as we move into recession, opportunities will arise. The fact that <place-holder colnum=\"12267\"/> projects might now attract lower tenders than would otherwise have been the case is a potential benefit to any Government that has money to spend. We should compare the estimated costs of the replacement Forth bridge with the costs of similar construction projects in other parts of the world and closely examine them to establish whether we can get better value for the public's money than we would have done had the recession not come along.</p><p>One reason why fewer projects are in progress at the moment is the fact that the Government has placed obstacles in their path. The single biggest obstacle is the failure to make rapid progress on the development of a funding mechanism that will allow those projects to be realised. We have talked a great deal about the Scottish Futures Trust but, unfortunately, it has manifestly failed to deliver. Those of us who believe that, when it begins to operate, the SFT will be almost indistinguishable from public-private partnership simply wish that the Government would get on with delivering funding for projects on the ground. Soon, many Scots with no jobs will look to funded projects to provide them with employment.</p><p>That said, the real blame lies with the Scottish Government's predecessor, because many of the projects in question were proposed long before the present Government came to power.

I do not say that entirely frivolously because it shows that, for many of us, the red squirrel is a cultural icon of which we should be proud.</p><p>The red squirrel's situation in Scotland is not of our making but&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;the human race was responsible for transporting grey squirrels across the Atlantic to Scotland. Grey squirrels are far better than the indigenous red squirrel at competing in the available environment.</p><p>The previous speaker&#8212;Peter Peacock&#8212;described one problem. He said that he has no particular dislike of the grey squirrel and that he sees them often. I dislike the grey squirrel. The reason why we see grey squirrels is that they are not afraid of areas that are more heavily populated with human beings. The grey squirrel will live in such an environment, whereas the red squirrel will not choose to live near or among human beings. As the country's population becomes bigger and as our species spreads out, we consequently restrict the opportunity for red squirrels to live in our environment.</p><p>The red squirrel has survived well in Scotland when it has become almost extinct in other parts of the United Kingdom because we can provide an acceptable environment for it. However, we must accept that that environment is not perfect for the red squirrel. Often, the surviving red squirrel populations are in commercial pine plantations, when they would rather live in a mixed deciduous and pine environment. However, because such restricted man-made environments support red <place-holder colnum=\"11297\"/> squirrels and are significantly less attractive to greys&#8212;particularly higher up the hills, where the environment and weather can be more severe&#8212;Scotland has allowed the reds to survive longer.</p><p>It is ironic that, if we talk to half a dozen conservationists about the importance of preserving indigenous species, we will hear at least a dozen opinions. It is extraordinary that species that have been extinct in Scotland for some time are being reintroduced, when we should perhaps exert more of our effort on ensuring that we lose no more species. It is ironic that species are being reintroduced that will predate on red squirrels, if they are given the opportunity.</p><p>Some people exploit the red squirrel. It is ironic that, at the public inquiry into the Aberdeen western peripheral route this week, the squirrel became the centre of attention. Opponents of the road used the red squirrel's situation as an opportunity&#8212;perhaps as an excuse&#8212;to demand that habitats be protected and that the road be moved or perhaps even stopped altogether. The red squirrel is not responsible for that situation, but attempts by human beings to exploit it give it a bad name, at times.</p><p>A battle line has been drawn&#8212;the grey squirrel continues to encroach and the red squirrel continues to give ground. Where the line is drawn at the moment is perhaps insignificant; where it will be in a few years worries me more. By encouraging proper economic development of Scotland's hills, supporting commercial forestry and perhaps changing the rules to link areas of forest so that populations of squirrels can move through them, we can create not the ideal environment, but an environment that will allow the red squirrel to survive, to continue its rearguard action and to remain a relatively common species in some areas of Scotland for the foreseeable future.</p><p>I have seen more red squirrels dead than alive this year.

The members who speak in such debates often take a singular interest in the subject, but occasionally&#8212;in contrast to what Lewis Macdonald suggested&#8212;a fresh-faced new contributor such as me arrives. I do not consider tourism to be one of my primary interests in parliamentary political activity but, having read the report and heard the debate, I have been well and timeously informed about the issues that face the tourism industry. For that reason, I thank the contributors to the report.</p><p>The Conservatives had a particular angle on the development of tourism in Scotland. We founded the area tourist boards in 1994, which established <place-holder colnum=\"11050\"/> the concept of local representation and an area forum on which tourism operators could focus. It is unfortunate that the previous Government&#8212;I can say that in this Parliament&#8212;was determined to centralise that structure. It has been suggested that we were complicit in that to an extent, but the system now lacks local representation. From speaking to many people around the north-east, I know that tourism businesses no longer feel that they have a handle on the industry. Whatever is done through Government or as a result of the committee's report, we must ensure that people at the grass roots of the industry feel that they are contributing. Much that the report says requires that of us in the long term.</p><p>In presenting the report, Iain Smith highlighted the fact that Scotland's tourism industry has much to sell. We all know that golf, whisky and genealogy provide ways to hang Scotland's tourism industry on the top pegs along with anything that the rest of the world has to offer. However, as he said, the report identified one or two areas in which work needs to be done.</p><p>Investment in the Scottish tourism industry is necessary but, as is right, it needs to be industry driven. Tourism will always be led by the private sector, and any industry that wishes to succeed must be industry led. That is why it is important that we stick to the committee's recommendation on that.</p><p>I did not realise how bad the skills situation is. Figures that Maureen Watt quoted in her opening speech make it clear that we still lack the structure to train people in the necessary skills to make our industry the world leader that it could be.</p><p>A range of transport issues is involved. Transport is as important to the tourism industry as it is to any other industry, if not more important. If tourists cannot spread out from the central belt into rural areas and other cities and up to the tops of our mountains, tourism will remain a regional industry. We cannot allow that to happen, particularly if we consider, as Murdo Fraser pointed out, that tourism is now the most important industry in our rural areas. Nowadays, tourism far exceeds traditional industries such as farming and fishing.</p><p>The minister highlighted the fact that next year is the year of homecoming. I have a question for the Government, which the minister who closes the debate may be able to answer today or, if not, in the weeks and months to come. The beginning of the year of homecoming is now only a little over three months away; has any assessment been done of the likely increase in tourism levels in Scotland next year as a result of this promotion?</p><p>The year of homecoming is a great idea, which should succeed. However, if it fails, Scotland will <place-holder colnum=\"11051\"/> have failed a critical test that we must learn from very quickly, given that the next such opportunity may well be the 2014 Commonwealth games. If we get our international promotion for next year wrong, we may also go on to miss another significantly more important boat when the time comes for the games in 2014.</p><p>Gavin Brown pointed out that domestic tourism in Scotland is on the slide&#8212;only by a tiny margin perhaps, but it is dropping nonetheless. He also noted that tourism from other parts of the United Kingdom is rising. In these difficult economic times, we have to market Scotland to the very important UK domestic market&#8212;I would never suggest for one minute that we should turn that domestic market into a foreign market. Gavin Brown did not have time to point out that the &#163;4.2 billion that we attribute to the tourism industry in Scotland is significantly down on the valuation of &#163;5 billion that it had in the last year of Conservative government in the 1990s.</p><p>In response to David Whitton, I could repeat what I said in my speech last week on Caledonian MacBrayne: yes, we need a responsive ferry service, particularly in the Western Isles, and the way to get that is by letting the private sector in, because Caledonian MacBrayne is failing the tests. David Whitton pointed out another test that it has failed.</p><p>The target of 50 per cent growth is a huge ambition. If we are to achieve that, we will have to do everything we can for the industry. The Government must not take control but must offer the opportunities and encourage the private sector. Only by doing that will we achieve the 50 per cent growth target. Let us work together to ensure that that happens.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14005179", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin in the traditional way by thanking those who contributed to the report.

It is only when one tries to apply or administer the process that it becomes extremely complicated and unwieldy. I suspect that that challenge will face us for ever more.</p><p>A brief that was circulated by the Scottish Property Federation contains in its conclusions a view with which I find some common ground.

Also, inevitably, some situations will bring about breaches of the current regulation. As has been pointed out, frustration with a moribund system that struggles to cope with the demands that are placed on it can be enough to provoke some people to progress beyond the level of development for which they have permission.</p><p>I am concerned that we have heard at least one example from Iain Smith that was probably inappropriate for use in this context. As a result of problems in the north-east of Scotland regarding Travellers and Traveller sites, I have been made aware of the situation that he described in north-east Fife by my colleague, Ted Brocklebank. It is difficult for us to apply reason to situations regarding planning that affect Travellers and travelling people, as there are so many other things that have to be dealt with in those circumstances. Many illegal encampments have to be dealt with under other aspects of the law before we progress to using planning law in those particular circumstances.</p><p>As I said, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the matter. I am concerned that some people will abuse the system and overstep the mark deliberately. At the same time, many will not do that. Councils and some other departments are creating a problem if they are failing to apply retrospectively the same standards that they would have applied for any planning application. The idea that a building that has been constructed without proper permission should be treated differently is unacceptable, whether that is a positive or a negative for the developer or constructor.</p><p>The law as it stands should be given the chance to be used effectively and to demonstrate how effective it can be. I do not believe that we should revisit the matter and apply draconian conditions at this stage.

It was with some relief that we discovered that the service will continue throughout most of the summer. However, today members are brought together by the need to ensure that it continues well beyond that period. Too many people in Scotland have failed so far to recognise the importance of the ferry service. The true market for the service is estimated to be far in excess of the number of those who have been prepared to use it to date.</p><p>As we see fuel prices rising day after day, many road hauliers and private individuals who seek to get to the continent find that ferry fares pale into insignificance when compared with the cost of running a heavy goods vehicle all the way to an English Channel port in order to access the European market. For that reason, we have to work very hard. We have heard in previous speeches about how important the ferry service is not only for our exports, but for the environment, which is being protected from significant emissions but could be protected further.</p><p>The ferry service is not entirely without public subsidy but, having looked at the subsidies that are provided to other ferry services elsewhere in Scotland, I am surprised to discover just how little financial support was necessary to get the service off the ground and to keep it running. For that reason, I am delighted that the ferry service was established.</p><p>Before I finish, I will speculate or hypothesise a little about how things could have been rather different. We depend on a foreign-owned company to provide the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry service and today there is probably not a single Scottish company that could conceive of providing that important service to Scotland. However, if a bus lane were to run all the way to Zeebrugge, perhaps a Scottish company such as Stagecoach would be ready and willing to bid for the contract to provide that service. Perhaps if there were a railway line that ran from Rosyth to Zeebrugge, a company such as FirstGroup plc&#8212;or even First ScotRail, heaven forbid&#8212;would be ready to bid for that contract.</p><p>We have never taken the opportunity to free up the market in ferry services here in Scotland, so there is no comparable Scottish ferry company ready to bid for that contract. That is why I encourage the minister to consider in the context of the publication tomorrow of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's report into ferry services&#8212;and with many decisions to be made during his prospective tenure as transport minister&#8212;that the time has probably come to give Scotland's private ferry companies the opportunity to compete in the marketplace.

Who would have thought that the first great measure to prove that change would be a tax cut, proposed by the SNP and accelerated <place-holder colnum=\"9554\"/> by the Conservatives' willingness to support it in the budget negotiations? However, there it is: that unholy alliance, so often referred to, was what actually delivered the positive change. Indeed, I hope to develop the argument that the change was not only positive but essential.</p><p>Many of our town centres across Scotland are full of small businesses that pay rates. Many are dependent on retail, and many provide services, but most suffer competition&#8212;unfair competition, in my view&#8212;with larger businesses that have greater advantages. How many small shopkeepers in our towns have complained to us over the years that while they pay rates and have parking restrictions on their doorstep, the Tescos, Asdas and whoever else on the outskirts of the town pay less in rates per square metre of floor area and can provide free parking on their doorstep, giving them huge advantages?</p><p>It is good that we have taken action to relieve the burden on small businesses, particularly at a time when so many other burdens are increasing. We have heard about the fuel costs and some of the stealth taxes. More recently, we have heard about threats to remove post offices from small shops, which could threaten their viability in many ways. We also have a series of laws&#8212;perhaps justified&#8212;to restrict the sales of alcohol and tobacco, which again may undermine the viability of some smaller businesses. For those reasons, it is good that we decided to use the Parliament's powers to cut the tax burden on some of the most vulnerable businesses.</p><p>That is what happened: we used the powers of the Parliament to cut tax. So many people who talk about the Parliament's tax-raising powers and seek to debate their future find themselves coming up against the argument that they are tax-raising powers that will be used only to raise taxes. That is why so many people are afraid of them. However, the Scottish Parliament has the power to reduce taxes, and only now, nine years after its establishment, do we have a clear example of how the power can be used to benefit businesses and local economies.</p><p>Elaine Murray gave a clear explanation of what the Labour Party thinks about taxation and expenditure. It believes that, as with individuals, taxing businesses and choosing how to spend the money is the right way to go, and it seeks to attach strings to any money that it gives back. Elaine Murray simply confirmed the interventionist and centralising tendency that the Labour Party has always demonstrated.</p><p>There are many other things that we could do. For example, we could push forward with the Conservatives' proposal for an eco-bonus scheme, which would encourage small businesses, as well as individuals in their own <place-holder colnum=\"9555\"/> homes, to develop energy efficiency and microrenewable technology. However, we must consider seriously what we think taxation is for. Although it is about raising money to provide public services, simply raising more and more money will ultimately kill the goose that lays the golden egg. By reducing the burden on small businesses at such an opportune time, we have increased the opportunity for investment and, more important in the current context, we have helped to save some businesses that might not have survived otherwise.</p><p>Therefore, on this occasion, it is important that we Conservatives do not consider ourselves to be anything other than the people who accelerated the policy and the advantages that it brings. We are proud of that, and although the Liberal Democrats have proposed that there should be all sorts of investigations to see whether the scheme is working, we take a simpler position and believe that the scheme is fundamentally a good thing. That is an absolute; it is beyond question.</p><p>We have also heard some interesting concepts from the Government's back benches today. There is a certain irony in much of what I have said because although today we are observing the minority SNP Government behaving in its centre-right mode, on other days it behaves in its centre-left mode. Today, we have seen some members who traditionally give rather left-of-centre speeches in the unusual situation of having to justify their position. For example, Aileen Campbell tried very hard to argue that this is not a right-wing policy. For the life of me, I cannot understand how it could be anything else.</p><p>The Parliament has a tradition of Governments lodging self-congratulatory motions. The Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition developed that into an art form, and the minority SNP Government has sought to develop it still further. Today, the Conservatives are not hesitant in giving our view that the policy was ours from the start, that the minority Government developed it, that it only got it through with the support of the Conservatives, and that the benefit to small businesses was a result of our pressure. We might not like self-congratulatory motions, but we are delighted to have lodged a self-congratulatory amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13736303", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Small Business Bonus Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Who would have thought in the dull, dark days of 1997 that the first part of the United Kingdom to be freed from the dead hand of Labour control would be Scotland?

I begin with the Conservative amendment, which mentions the notion that public services can be improved only by spending more money. I think that we are past that notion and I hope that Labour has learned from its mistakes when in government, particularly in the early days of the Scottish Parliament, when huge amounts of public money were ploughed into health services to no avail. Only last night, I congratulated Andy Kerr on tidying up that mess.</p><p>As we consider the expenditure of public money and what we get for it, we must consider efficiency. The motion is entitled \"Effective Public Services\", which is something that we should all pursue. However, although I forgive the Government for making the mistake of thinking that expenditure of public money is the same as improvement in public services, I cannot forgive Bruce Crawford for the persistent failure in his opening speech to realise that public services and the public sector are two different things and that the opportunity to exploit the private and voluntary sectors more effectively can deliver much-improved and more efficient public services.</p><p>I know that that idea exists in parts of the Government because, only two weeks ago, I attended a meeting of representatives from the north-east with the leader and deputy leader of Aberdeen City Council. At the meeting, John Swinney explained at great length where the council had gone wrong and how it might steer back from its difficult situation. He said that keeping too many services in-house and preserving the council's funding streams at the expense of the voluntary sector was one reason why the council had lost its way.</p><p>I have heard other Government ministers explain at great length how the private sector can deliver public services effectively. At the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee this week, I heard the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change, Stewart Stevenson, explain at great length why the extension of the ScotRail franchise and the incentivisation of further development of services would actually deliver money back to the Scottish Government and to the Scottish transport user, rather than simply resulting in incentives disappearing and money being wasted. That represents another opportunity for the private sector to deliver.<place-holder colnum=\"8477\"/></p><p>Why does this Government refuse to realise that many more opportunities exist for private sector investment and ingenuity to deliver real improvements in public service? Why does the Government not take the opportunity to join the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats and do something about Scottish Water, bringing about the efficiencies that are possible there? Why does the Government not join us in taking Scottish Water into a mutual model that will deliver real savings for the taxpayer? Why does the Government not take the opportunity to do something about providing effective public services? The Government could do those things by turning away from the dogma that public service and the public sector are synonymous.</p><p>During the debate, other points have been raised that concern me. Although we in the Conservatives understand why the Government has pursued efficiency savings without compulsory redundancies, we must never forget that public service is not a job-creation scheme. Effective and efficient public services can, in themselves, deliver the opportunity for improved private sector growth that can create as many jobs as the public sector, and can do so in such a way as to generate a return for the economy as a whole.</p><p>There are many opportunities that the Government has not taken up. Let us work together and move forward to a point at which public service can be delivered effectively and efficiently by all sectors&#8212;not just the public sector. Such a move, and such opportunities, will deliver the real efficiency savings that the Government has sought for so long.

Most of what needs to be said on that has already been said, but I make the point that our whisky industry is, among many things, one of the most significant industries in the peripheral parts of the Scottish economy. In areas where wages are lowest and <place-holder colnum=\"8216\"/> the economy is most rural, a distillery is often a major part of the local economy. Like many of our less significant industries, it is not a huge employer but it is an important employer in some areas. I regret the fact that the chancellor has reversed the practice of previous Governments&#8212;especially Conservative Governments&#8212;by destabilising the relationship between alcohol taxation on spirits and taxation on wines and beers.</p><p>During the days of the Conservative Government&#8212;those 18 glorious years that we are so keen to talk about here&#8212;the whisky industry underwent a renaissance. During that period, distilleries that had been in mothballs for many years came back into production. We should thank that Government for that.</p><p>I move on to a couple of issues that have not yet been raised in the debate, the first of which is the proposed climate change bill&#8212;a priority of the Parliament and the Government that may yet find support from the Conservatives&#8212;and some of the legislation that will have to be passed in conjunction with it. Some issues that relate to that bill lie under the chancellor's control. That is why I am extremely disappointed that Labour has not taken action to move forward positively on two aspects. First, it has done nothing to encourage the introduction of smart metering. Electricity meters provide an opportunity for us all to see how much energy we use and to exploit it more efficiently. Encouraging electricity companies to support smart metering was in the chancellor's power, but he failed to do that.</p><p>Secondly, the chancellor has failed to take the opportunity to encourage the introduction of proper feed-in tariffs, which can give those of us who wish to invest in opportunities to generate electricity domestically through microrenewables a proper return in the marketplace. I encourage the chancellor&#8212;should he survive to see another budget&#8212;to act on those issues.</p><p>The key issue to which I return is transport. I was interested that the chancellor, who represents an Edinburgh constituency, said in his budget speech:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am setting aside new funding to develop the technology that could underpin national road pricing, inviting tenders to test this with the results expected next year.\"</p><p>It greatly disappoints many of us that the chancellor seems to believe that the motorist can yield yet more tax revenue in the long term. Having seen the debates about introducing city-entry charges for Edinburgh and about tolls on the Tay and Forth bridges, surely the chancellor should have recognised the evidence on his doorstep that road pricing would not be popular.<place-holder colnum=\"8217\"/></p><p>Finally, I will talk about fuel duty. Our amendment would add words only at the end of the Government's motion because we do not wish to rule out anything that could deal with the problem of fuel costs in rural Scotland. The chancellor's decision to proceed with a 2p increase in tax on a litre of fuel&#8212;albeit deferred until October again&#8212;shows that he sees the motorist, the road haulage industry and the economy that it supports as providing a tax-yielding opportunity rather than a means to stimulate development.</p><p>Worse still, the chancellor said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For environmental reasons we will increase fuel duty by 1/2 pence per litre in real terms from 2010.\"</p><p>I started by talking about peripherality. We in Scotland&#8212;particularly in the Highlands and Islands&#8212;know that fuel prices here are significantly and artificially higher than those in the rest of the United Kingdom. Even before the industrial action at Grangemouth, that tendency had spread to areas that are much nearer the central belt. Scotland now suffers disproportionately from the cost of fuel. The tax on fuel is so high that it is damaging the whole Scottish economy. We should consider in greater depth how we deal with that before the opportunity arises again to tackle it.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403640", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Kingdom Budget"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by saying that James Kelly wouldnae catch me in a wine bar.

Their actions have done more to put at risk this potential investment than they have done to bring it closer to fruition.

In large areas of Scotland, including the Highlands and, in particular, rural Aberdeenshire, we have a problem with drivers&#8212;especially young drivers&#8212;who pass their tests and go on to the roads believing that they can do anything without being caught. A consequence of that is that a large number of young drivers are killed or seriously injured, or find themselves being charged with offences relating to such accidents. Persistent offenders on the roads need to believe, if their behaviour is to be influenced in the longer term, that there is a danger that their offences will be detected and punished. I would like the principles of high-profile policing to be applied not just in our communities, but on our roads. That would remove the emphasis on gadgetry that is reflected in the increasing use of speed cameras and other new technology, which is designed to catch <place-holder colnum=\"7573\"/> motorists who speed rather than those who are dangerous on the roads.</p><p>There are two other issues that I want to bring to the attention of the Parliament and, in particular, the cabinet secretary. Although I praise the previous Government for the work that it did in increasing the number of police officers in the Grampian region&#8212;that figure rose quite significantly during the eight years of the Labour-Liberal Democrat Administration&#8212;it appears that, over the same period, Tayside Police had a significantly lower increase. In fact, in the period for which I have figures, 2001 to 2006, there was virtually no increase in police numbers in the Tayside region. I have spoken to the chief constable of Tayside and know that he is concerned to ensure that his manning levels are kept up.</p><p>Of course, in Grampian, manning levels have been going up significantly, but it remains the case that Grampian has only 8 per cent of Scotland's police officers, to cover an area that has 10 per cent of Scotland's people. It has been pointed out that the percentage of police officers should not necessarily equal the percentage of the population, but there are other reasons why police numbers should be kept up in the area that Grampian Police covers.</p><p>First, there is a rapidly growing population, so the numbers are almost always out of date. Secondly, we have the headquarters of the North Sea oil industry, which is Scotland and the United Kingdom's most important energy industry. Responsibility for policing that high-profile industry on and offshore, which has been highlighted by threats in recent times, is such that resources are necessary if we are to protect the industry. There is also a long-standing complaint that the responsibility that Grampian Police takes for royal protection duties over and above the duties that are undertaken by the royal protection group means that additional costs are incurred when the royal family is resident on Deeside.</p><p>Mr Speaker&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402003", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police Resources"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mike Rumbles is absolutely right, but I highlighted the behaviour of young people because I wanted to go on to suggest that we should treat other members of the community in a similar way.

I accept that our railways provide social and environmental benefits but&#8212;as members would expect&#8212;as a Tory, I am concerned about the economic benefits. There have been, some might observe, one or two occasions on which the Conservative party has chosen to support the SNP minority Government on key issues. One of those very few occasions was when we were dealing with the proposal for the Edinburgh airport rail link. The Conservatives supported the SNP proposal that we downscale that quite significantly, in order to free up resources for other important projects supporting railway development&#8212;particularly in central Scotland&#8212;and, ultimately, for the electrification of the railway line between Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p><p>We are proud that we made that decision, because it was an important step forward, but we did so because we believe that the railways are of significant economic importance. They underpin our economy and our economic growth. Ultimately, good-quality economic growth is essential to everything that we wish to achieve, including the provision of good-quality public <place-holder colnum=\"6305\"/> services. It is for that reason that I am keen to ensure that how we choose to price rail services in future does not simply rely on some people being able to travel more cheaply than others and some people having to pay more.</p><p>I would like a system to be developed that is rather more complex than that and which mirrors, in some ways, the pricing policy that is adopted by the low-cost airlines. For economic reasons, I want to ensure that a high-quality, 35-minute service between Edinburgh and Glasgow is available at times of peak demand to serve the economies of those two great cities, by moving as many people as possible to and from their work so that they can productively generate resource within the Scottish economy. I would like the trains that currently run empty or half empty to be filled with all the people who can take the social benefits of a cheaper rail service.</p><p>For that reason, I am not inclined at this stage to support the concept of extending the availability of discount cards. I would rather that a policy was put in place that allowed very cheap fares to be provided at certain times of the day, which would let those who could benefit most take advantage, while ensuring that our economic well-being is the highest priority at the times when the trains are likely to be busiest.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13398967", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail Improvements (Central Scotland)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise for the fact that, due to another appointment, I will be unable to stay for the end of the debate, but I will read with interest the other speeches in the Official Report.

We have been given a history lesson today by Des McNulty and other Labour members who, as victors, have been able to invent the reasons and justifications behind the referendum on the water industry that was held by Strathclyde Regional Council. They have been able to do that because they were the victors, but I warn the Labour Party that it is not winning any more. It will no longer be able to write history.</p><p>Many of us who did not want the situation that we face today opposed the process that created Scottish Water, but credit must given where it is due. Scottish Water's control of the Scottish water industry has served to bring together, and has begun to solve, some of the many problems that our water industry faced. The nature and scale of those problems dictated the direction that previous Governments took in managing Scotland's water industry. Mutualisation was perhaps considered at the start of that process, but it would have been very difficult when massive problems had to be solved and massive investment had to be directed. It is therefore only right that Derek Brownlee's motion proposes a review of the current position so that action can be taken in advance of the next spending review in 2011. That is a reasonable ask.</p><p>The reason why we need such a review is that the different political parties present the Scottish water industry and Scottish Water in different ways in order to make different claims. However, one or two of the claims that have been made today must be questioned. On the efficiency of Scottish Water and on the extent to which water bills in Scotland are competitive, in comparison with those that are issued by companies elsewhere, some members fail to take into account the fact that the taxpayer pays to Scottish Water the equivalent of about &#163;100 per household, which does not appear in those bills.

There are simply one or two key areas in which views that have been expressed in the chamber, particularly on the Government front benches, call into question the SNP's commitment to some of the broad principles that we all hold dear.</p><p>I share Jim Mather's enthusiasm for renewable energy. It is important that we develop the renewable energy industry in Scotland, as renewable energy may be one of the things that our economy relies on in the future. However, his opening speech raised one or two important questions in my mind. I put those questions to him in the hope that we get clear and unequivocal answers at the end of the debate. He told us that we do not need nuclear energy, but he and members of his party have enthusiastically greeted the extension of Hunterston B's lifespan, which is evidence that Scotland appears to need nuclear energy in the short term and perhaps the medium term at least.</p><p>What does Jim Mather mean when he compares installed capacity with potential production? I want him to address directly an idea that has been raised by previous speakers. When he says that the installed capacity of renewables in Scotland now exceeds nuclear capacity, surely he must realise that, on an on-going basis, the energy produced by renewables is unlikely to exceed much more than 35 or 40 per cent of its installed capacity. The energy produced by nuclear power stations&#8212;when they are running, which is most of the time&#8212;is much nearer to 100 per cent of their installed capacity. Before he tells me that there have been shutdowns at our nuclear plants, I remind him that there was also a major shutdown last year at the Longannet coal-fired plant.

Our nuclear industry can survive for a very long period on the un-reprocessed fuel that already exists in the United Kingdom. The fuelling of nuclear power stations is not an issue.</p><p>Two things in Jim Mather's speech confused me slightly and worried me rather more. The first of those was the SNP's broad commitment to the <place-holder colnum=\"5169\"/> concept of a separate Scottish renewables obligation, producing a separate Scottish renewables obligation certificate. What worries me about that is the fact that any changes that destabilised the regime that has encouraged the development of our existing renewables industry would have the potential to cause a major shift in investment. The last thing that we want in Scotland is an undermining of the existing renewables industry.</p><p>The second thing that worries me slightly is the fact that that may be combined with attempts to change significantly the transmission charge system, as Jim Mather mentioned. If an increasing level of energy production in Scotland, attracting the support of Scottish renewables obligation certificates, is combined with changes in the transmission charge system, there is a danger that, if the minister gets it wrong, Scotland's electricity may become the most expensive anywhere in the world and the transmission charge system may ensure that that expense is dumped entirely on the Scottish consumer. If the minister gets it wrong, there will be a grave risk to our economy in the future.</p><p>There are a couple of points that I need to address quickly, relating to nuclear power. First, I am not here to argue for the construction of new nuclear power stations in Scotland as, sadly, that argument may now have been lost; however, nuclear energy still has the potential to provide the cheapest electricity. The reason for that is simple. Perhaps coal and gas plant can produce cheaper electricity than nuclear plant on the basis of the whole-life cost figures of plant today; however, if the cost of carbon capture is added to those, the whole-life cost of nuclear plant could yet make it the cheapest source of electricity.</p><p>Secondly, the Scottish Government has made a commitment that there will be no new nuclear power stations in Scotland; however, I put it to the chamber that that position is fundamentally dishonest. Every part of the policy that the Government has put forward is wholly reliant on having a good neighbour to the south and a connection to the national grid that can supply us with electricity on the days when the wind does not blow and the waves do not rise. That dependence ensures that Scotland is wholly dependent on the United Kingdom's future investment in nuclear technology and means that the Government's position is hypocritical and dishonest.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395878", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is much longer than that.

I welcome those who are in the public gallery and who were at today's conference. The theme of science and the Parliament is important and we should be proud to support that theme in the debate and in the Parliament generally. Scotland has a tremendous record on science, which is based on our great education tradition. Scotland was one of the first countries to educate a high proportion of its population. From an early stage, science and the engineering that evolved from it were key principles in our burgeoning industrialising economy. Of course, that industrialisation has resulted in some of the problems that we face today. The theme of the science behind climate change is an appropriate one for Scotland, which knows what it has been responsible for in the past and what it must achieve in the future.</p><p>As I said, the idea of science in the Parliament is important. Some members know a bit about science and can talk with authority on scientific subjects, but others are influenced more by public pressure and sometimes perhaps by public prejudice. That is why it is good that we have offers from scientists of all kinds to educate members and keep us right about the facts on many scientific issues. During the argument about the future of energy generation in Scotland, we have had to suffer some rather ill-informed comments about our erstwhile important nuclear industry. In recent times, we have had problems explaining to some members the possible significance of genetic engineering and biotechnology for Scotland's economy in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Political prejudices often stand in the way of advances, so the offers of education are useful.</p><p>We must be careful in talking about climate change and how we deal with it, because Scotland has much to offer on that. The idea that we should simply run down our economy to remove our emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and other global-warming gases is simply unacceptable in a developed democracy.</p><p>If we value our public services, and if we are concerned to ensure that men and women in this country are not subjected to the disadvantages of poverty that previous generations suffered, we must ensure that our economy continues to grow. For that reason, we must go back once again to the people in our country who have a great record <place-holder colnum=\"3867\"/> in science and engineering and who can achieve still greater things in the future.</p><p>An engineering solution to Scotland's problems would, of course, be valuable because it would save us from economic degeneration. More important, if we can develop new technologies that assist the rest of the world in achieving the same aims, there will be two benefits: first, we will deliver benefits to other countries that do not have our advantages; and secondly, if we can persuade other countries&#8212;China and India in particular&#8212;to use our new technologies instead of digging up and burning the coal that we know they have, their surplus gases will not blow around the world and cause the problems that we suffer here.</p><p>Scotland has a great past in science and engineering. However, in recent years we have seen a drift away from those subjects in our schools and universities; and we hear now that schools have a shortage of maths and physics teachers, in particular. Let us, the politicians, solve the problems that are in front of us today, but let us also ensure that our education system in the future is designed to produce the next generation of science and engineering graduates who will deliver what we need in Scotland and all around the world.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393079", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Science and the Parliament"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Des McNulty on securing the debate.

We must examine it closely, because it sets out the Government's intentions not only for the immediate future but for four years. When I consider its priorities, it is easy for me to find things that I agree with, but one or two things betray a very traditional attitude for a Scottish Government. There is&#8212;sadly&#8212;a reluctance to invest where investment is necessary to underpin true economic growth. Since the budget was published, I have believed that there is far too great a tendency to rely on expenditure in the public sector to fuel growth, and an unwillingness to take the necessary steps to encourage private sector growth, which would create the jobs and the economic expansion that we all want. The call \"It's Scotland's oil\" is continually reverted to, and it is interesting to debate that claim, but such debates are not necessary at this time, because Scotland has the potential for strong growth.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth and others have told us that he is prepared to invest in Scotland's universities, but it has become increasingly obvious in recent days that that investment is not all that it could be. It is essential that we remember that simply dictating from the chair is not the way for a minister to behave, and that action must be taken if we are to achieve the necessary expansion in Scotland's universities to ensure that they are not disadvantaged in comparison with their English counterparts. As Derek Brownlee suggested, an independent inquiry into university funding is the way to go. Such an inquiry would tell us what is truly necessary to ensure that no imbalance exists <place-holder colnum=\"3585\"/> in the university sectors north and south of the border.</p><p>I will concentrate on the key issue in the Conservative party's amendment&#8212;support for small businesses. It is important that we support small businesses, because there are a great many of them in Scotland and they are a major source of employment. Despite the drift towards incorporation by smaller businesses in recent years, taxation&#8212;in many cases, personal taxation&#8212;is still a major cost for them.</p><p>How can we underpin our economy and ensure that we do not target too many resources on a handful of projects that may not deliver what we want? Small businesses should be targeted, as there are small businesses throughout Scotland. In our most rural areas, they represent a disproportionate measure of the activity in the economy. It is essential to recognise that, as has been said previously, the tax burden on small businesses is set to rise, and that it will rise considerably over the next two or three years. That is why we must ensure that their tax burden is cut at the earliest possible opportunity. Obviously, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth ultimately will achieve his declared aim of cutting business rates for small businesses, but he has not taken the opportunity to cut them immediately. By committing to doing so, he could give Scotland's small businesses a real shot in the arm at a time when they need it.</p><p>Labour's pointless debates on the budget have been referred to. Attempts to secure debates that are simply opportunities to grandstand with no decision-making process following them will not deliver the changes that we need. The Conservatives have clearly set out their stall: we want improved opportunities for businesses, investment in infrastructure and an independent inquiry into university funding. Unless we get promises on those, it will be difficult for the Parliament to unite behind a budget. The opportunity to do so still lies some way in the future. I hope that, following the debate, we will understand better how we can achieve unanimity.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392330", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I always liked the clowns.

However, I am concerned that the independence that has been afforded the bridge boards and, subsequently, the transport authorities&#8212;owing to the fact that they have their own independent income through the toll booths&#8212;could be undermined. I therefore seek assurances from the minister that the bill will not mark the start of a process that will lead to the removal of the bridge boards' powers to make decisions about the long-term well-being of the structures in their charge.</p><p>I am aware that an attempt has been made&#8212;I believe that it has been successful&#8212;to retain the power to borrow, but so far that power has been exercised against a steady income stream.

It is extremely important that we address the issue, which a number of members have raised, of what a Government is expected to do to implement its manifesto commitments. The Conservative party will work hard to ensure that as many of our manifesto commitments as possible appear in decisions that are made by this Parliament and implemented by this Government over the next four years. Complaints that the SNP minority Government is not successfully implementing its manifesto ring hollow to someone like me, who has watched the Scottish Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats stand on their manifestos at successive elections. The moment that their members were elected, they went into a huddle in a smoke-filled room to negotiate a partnership for Government, which often completely denied the policies on which they had stood. Those parties should look at their history and see what hypocrisy that might reveal.</p><p>I want to talk about our position in relation to the scrutiny of previous budgets. In the early days of the Parliament, the problem was that the Labour-Lib Dem Government changed the figures that it published and the way in which it published them every year. It was, therefore, almost impossible for <place-holder colnum=\"3196\"/> a committee to scrutinise budgets properly. It is important that we do not change procedures lightly. This year, however, something slightly different is going on.

The radical changes in the price of grain, of which the cabinet secretary is well aware, have resulted in changes in some agricultural practices in Scotland's lowlands. Many of those who produce lambs and cattle on Scotland's hills rely on markets that exist further down the hills, but the sad fact is that the vastly increased grain prices this year are likely to lead to changes in farming policy on many of <place-holder colnum=\"2614\"/> those lower farms. In a normal year, farmers who choose to grow more grain might buy more cattle to feed it to. The fact that export prices are so high means that cattle will have to be a lot more expensive before farmers are willing to feed expensive grain to them.</p><p>The market for Scotland's hill livestock&#8212;the finishers lower down the hills&#8212;might well be about to dry up. The minister needs to take that situation into account when he considers what further support is likely to be necessary for Scotland's hill farmers.</p><p>The increase in feed costs is unlikely to impact only on Scotland's hill farmers. Scotland's pig and poultry industries will also suffer. The poultry industry's crisis can be dealt with in a fairly short-term way because of the short cycles that are involved. Although I have every sympathy with Scotland's poultry farmers, I suspect that they will manage to avoid the extreme losses that are now almost inevitable for Scotland's pig farmers as they attempt to downsize in the face of vastly increased grain prices.</p><p>It is for that reason that the minister hit on an important point in his opening remarks, which was that we have to examine the complete market structure. I make no apologies for mentioning once again, as I have done in the chamber many times before, the role of the retailers&#8212;largely, the supermarkets&#8212;in dealing with the crisis. Unfortunately, other sectors of Scottish agriculture have suffered in the past through low market returns due to low retail prices. In many cases, such as my own experience in the dairy industry, low prices have forced so many people out of the industry that supplies of raw material have begun to dry up and prices have had to be corrected.</p><p>Markets can do positive things as well as negative ones, but unless Scotland's retailers and the United Kingdom's supermarkets are willing to look seriously at guaranteeing a proper return in the marketplace for the end product that comes down off Scotland's hills, there will be no purpose for Scotland's hill farmers, Scotland will deteriorate to monoculture, and ultimately Scotland's farming industry and the contribution that it makes to rural Scotland will be lost. The minister has my full support in going back to the retailers and working as hard as he can to ensure that they account for themselves properly in the market.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389826", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agriculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Indeed.

On that day, Fiona Hyslop, who was then the SNP's shadow education minister, moved a motion, in non-Executive time, in which she set out SNP policy on early years education. Although I did not agree with everything that she said that day, I praised her for the vast majority of her proposals. It is interesting to observe the change that takes place when a party moves from opposition into government, when the instantly achievable priorities of opposition become a long four or eight-year haul in government. I give the cabinet secretary credit for the fact that she has made that transition very quickly.</p><p>In the debate back in February, most of us agreed that early years education was essential to the well-being of our young people and to their development as citizens. The importance of early years education, it was said, was that it provided the basis for young people to take appropriate advantage of education right through the scale and that it produced better citizens. That is an important part of what we must do, but the proposal that the minister has made today&#8212;although not quite as extreme as the one that she made on 8 February&#8212;is nonetheless just as broad and bland as the one that she made then.</p><p>My concern is that an allocation of additional hours to three and four-year-olds will simply be an across-the-board addition. On 8 February, we argued that there had to be prioritisation to ensure that those who had the most to lose would gain the most from the allocation of additional resources.</p><p>I am also concerned about the fairly arbitrary nature of the Executive's proposals on class sizes. Given my background, I tend to compare the proposals of the present Executive&#8212;as I did with those of previous Executives&#8212;with my experience when I was in primary school. Although it makes good sense to set an arbitrary maximum class size of 18 in some urban areas, that is virtually unachievable in many rural areas. The introduction of such an arbitrary maximum class size may mean that if a class had just one or two extra pupils, the need would arise for an extra teacher, an extra classroom and a great deal of extra expenditure. The truth is that in that environment, in which teachers with massive experience but massive workloads operate under difficult conditions with composite classes, small schools achieve some exceptional results. It is therefore <place-holder colnum=\"902\"/> important that, when allocating resources at that level, we prioritise and target the resources.</p><p>I was slightly worried to hear the minister say that decreasing school rolls would allow us to commit resources to some areas because, as has been pointed out to us, school rolls are not decreasing everywhere.</p><p>I was slightly disappointed that a particular issue, which she and I have discussed during previous debates and on which many people have come to Parliament to petition us, did not appear in the cabinet secretary's speech. That issue is the mainstreaming of special needs education. As we are well aware, the apparent decision by the previous Executive to presume in favour of mainstreaming special needs pupils has resulted in many teachers finding that their classes are disrupted. However, the parents of disruptive pupils would prefer to have the specialist provision that was in many cases previously provided. I would like the cabinet secretary to say something about moving abruptly away from the presumption that special needs education should be provided in the main stream.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385346", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smarter Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As someone who does not usually participate in education debates, I have considerable pleasure in being able to do so today, particularly when it is so interesting to juxtapose this debate with the one that took place on 8 February.

Although we have not discussed carbon offsetting at great length in the Parliament, it has nevertheless become important in many people's thinking. However, there are those who are concerned that carbon offsetting might not deliver all that we would wish it to.</p><p>The truth is that carbon offsetting is to some extent the privilege of the relatively well off. The experience in my party and of individuals within it makes it clear that we can offset carbon emissions if we wish to make a difference. The Conservatives make an effort to offset the carbon that is generated by our activity as a political party. Famously, David Cameron is an active carbon offsetter whenever the opportunity arises. The Conservative party and David Cameron have decided that the money that is spent on carbon offsetting should pay double by being spent on <place-holder colnum=\"737\"/> third-world projects&#8212;for example, the replacement of thermal with solar power plants. Not only do such projects deliver benefits locally, they deliver the secondary benefit of economic development in the area.</p><p>However, the importance that is attached to carbon trading perhaps reflects the complex nature of carbon offsetting. As other members have pointed out, significant concern has been expressed about how we can regulate carbon offsetting and ensure that it does us some good. Many programmes that have been supported under the Kyoto agreement have failed to achieve as much as some of the programmes that are not on the approved list. As a result, in deciding how to offset carbon, the Government in Scotland must evaluate the various programmes to ensure that it employs the best available, not simply those that have achieved international recognition.</p><p>The Conservatives are pleased to support the SNP amendment, because we feel that it extends the range of the terms of the motion. The Labour amendment, on the other hand, seeks to introduce a couple of additional elements. We do not object to that, especially as we agree with a broad range of the points that it sets out. However, I seek clarification of what is meant by</p><p class=\"indent\">\"high-quality and affordable public transport options\".</p><p>In that context, the word \"affordable\" could be interpreted in two ways. Are the options affordable only for public transport users or are they also affordable for the taxpayer? If we do not use taxpayers' money responsibly in the development of \"high-quality ... public transport options\", we might find ourselves in a difficult position in the long term. The Conservative amendment, of course, refers to the cost of carbon offsetting, because we are always concerned about the cost to the taxpayer. That said, although I seek clarification of that element of the Labour amendment, I agree with its broad thrust.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats' amendment seems to suffer from the fact that they have been toppled out of government. For a start, they applaud their own record in government, when, in fact, most of the initiatives that they highlight were brought in through the efforts of Sarah Boyack as a Labour minister and, later, as a Labour back bencher.</p><p>We must tackle the issue of carbon reduction head on. Carbon offsetting is an indulgence that salves the consciences only of the relatively well-off. Although Government must approach the matter carefully, cutting carbon must still be the first priority.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-173.2, to insert, after \"and its associated offset\":</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and the related cost to the taxpayer of such schemes,\".</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384991", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carbon Offsetting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Robin Harper and the Greens for introducing this issue for debate.

Scotland relies on international agreements and the behaviour of many other countries in Europe and elsewhere in order to ensure that our future is safe and environmentally sound, yet Scotland has the power to contribute towards that international achievement. That is why, when we consider the concept of a Scottish climate change bill, it is so important that we do not make the mistakes that could be made.</p><p>Several members have used phrases such as \"taking the lead\" and Rhona Brankin talked about defining Scotland's share of what is required to mitigate the effects of climate change. The problem with that is that Scotland is different; there are things that we can do here that cannot be done elsewhere and there are things that we can do more of here than can be done elsewhere. For instance, Scotland is ideally suited to exploiting <place-holder colnum=\"665\"/> renewable energy technology and we must take advantage of such opportunities. However, it is possible for us to make mistakes that could damage Scotland. The idea that Scotland's correct strategy on any area of policy should be to set an example means that we could ultimately find ourselves setting higher standards, setting higher hurdles and requiring achievements in the Scottish economy that undermine our potential to achieve the sustainable growth that is essential for our economic well-being.</p><p>It is therefore important for the Conservatives in supporting a Scottish climate change bill that such a bill should complement the action of any Government at Westminster and any agreement that is achieved in Europe or worldwide. It is a great pity that there will be no opportunity in the near future to change the Government at Westminster, as I genuinely believe that David Cameron's proposals in opposition for a climate change bill at Westminster are superior to anything that has been proposed by the current Labour Government. It would then be the role of the Scottish Executive&#8212;of whatever colour&#8212;to ensure that its policies and bill on climate change dovetailed into the climate change bill at Westminster to ensure that we do better what we can do better and do more of the things that Scotland is best suited to do but that we do not make the mistake of tying one hand of Scotland's economy behind its back simply to set an example.</p><p>Scotland's public services must be supported by sound economic growth.

Let no one forget the important role that the Conservatives have played.<place-holder colnum=\"348\"/></p><p>It is important that we get rid of tolls. We have heard much about Fife and its economy today, and I understand the importance of the Tay and Forth bridges to that economy, but as I come from further up in the north-east I am fully aware that the bridge across the Forth, if not the one across the Tay, is essential to the future economic development of the whole east and north-east of Scotland. We must consider the impact of anything that happens in relation to that bridge. It is true that there will be more traffic, but as I have always said, one man's traffic congestion is another man's economic development&#8212;we have to address that issue by other means.</p><p>Let us consider the views that have been expressed by other parties. I praise the SNP's views on tolls, but my colleagues in the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats have found the issue more difficult. It is difficult for the Labour Party, whose prominent and well-respected members Helen Eadie and Scott Barrie&#8212;our erstwhile colleague&#8212;worked hard to ensure that views in the Labour Party were changed.</p><p>For the Liberal Democrats, the situation has been slightly more ridiculous, with one policy being held in one area and another appearing to be held somewhere else. In February of this year, I watched Tavish Scott argue for the retention of tolls from the Government front bench. I suspect that there is a certain irony in the fact that, in the same month, someone somewhere was writing the Liberal Democrat election manifesto, which contained the promise to lift tolls on the Forth and Tay bridges.</p><p>The Edinburgh trams and the Edinburgh airport rail link are key issues in the debate, so it is important to look at the wording of Des McNulty's amendment. I am glad that it includes the word \"arbitrarily\", because the Government must be responsible. Costs, projected costs and business cases will always be important to how we progress such developments. We must remember that although the Conservatives support the schemes in question, we do not favour the handing out of any blank cheques. We are concerned to ensure that those and any other projects that go into the transport programme are properly evaluated so that we know how best they can be fitted in.</p><p>I draw members' attention to the amendment's final words, which recommend that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"all future major transport project proposals be properly costed, evaluated and prioritised.\"</p><p>The fact that today will be the first time that all parties in the Parliament will group around that particular set of commitments represents a major step forward in the provision of transport infrastructure in Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"349\"/></p><p>Another issue that we cannot pass over is the obvious requirement to make progress on a new Forth crossing. I have already highlighted the economic importance of the crossing of the Forth, which we all know about. Given that it now seems that the lifespan of the existing bridge is limited, we must begin to consider how we will provide a new crossing in years to come. Although it is good that we are ending the bridge tolls and the rigours that they bring for our economy, we should not dismiss the opportunity that the system of tolling may provide to finance&#8212;partly or wholly&#8212;any new crossing. There are other ways in which such a crossing could be funded, but at this stage we need to keep an open mind to ensure that it can be built as early and as cost effectively as possible.</p><p>The motion and the amendment challenge the nature of government. A minority Government must learn to progress by consensus. The acceptance of Des McNulty's amendment is a wonderful indication that consensus may be achievable. We cannot rule by arbitrary decisions, especially when we do not have a majority&#8212;even if we want to dual the A9 all the way to the moon.

In opposition, the SNP was determined not to exploit that method, but John Swinney has not addressed how he will achieve the necessary investment in public services without it. Has he considered the options for efficiency savings by forcing more public services into the private sector?

I can never accept that because, as a Conservative and therefore&#8212;no doubt members will dispute this&#8212;as a member of the pre-eminent unionist party in the Parliament, I think that it is a disgrace that we are not able to have a real discussion about policy.

I was out there campaigning against devolution and I voted against it, but I believe in the future of the union and in the current constitutional arrangements as the best way to achieve it. What does Labour contribute to the debate? Labour contributes a suggestion that there is rigidity in the current constitutional arrangements, that there is to be no further flexibility and that its record and the performance of the devolved settlement are inseparable. It makes the next election not a referendum on Scottish independence but a referendum on its record, and it seeks to take the union down with it. I cannot accept that.</p><p>What is the alternative? The alternative that Margaret Curran and I are equally afraid of is the Scottish National Party that sits opposite us. The minister suggested in her opening speech that the SNP seeks to make everything a constitutional issue. What evidence is there to support that? Every time the SNP speaks in Parliament, it seeks to make everything a constitutional issue. Almost every motion that is lodged by the SNP&#8212;even the ones that sound reasonably sensible&#8212;contains a bit at the end that suggests that everything would be better in an independent Scotland, without producing much evidence to support that.</p><p>The commonsense attitudes that are portrayed by certain members of the SNP are simply a smokescreen.

Behind them, though, when they make those statements, sit row upon row of socialists who would, given the opportunity, drag Scotland down.

Although we need to address significant problems to do with how teenagers are dealt with in school, early years education is almost as relevant to the issue. We must consider how we develop young people's thoughts and ideas as they move into education. Early years education has a long-term impact.<place-holder colnum=\"31936\"/></p><p>Fiona Hyslop was reasonably generous, although perhaps not as generous as she appeared to be, when she suggested that the build-up of resources and effort in early years education pre-dates the revolution of 1997. The furthering of early years education was a priority of the Conservative Government.</p><p>According to the SNP motion, our biggest priority must be to increase by 50 per cent the number of hours that children spend in the pre-school system. One point that has arisen during the debate is that, although that must be an on-going priority, it is not the biggest single priority. We all support continued pressure to increase resources for early years education, but any increase in the support must be clearly defined and targeted. Robert Brown said that resources must be targeted at increasing the quality rather than simply the quantity of early years provision. I am inclined to agree with his suggestion that quality should be the priority.</p><p>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton set out in greater detail how that priority should be set. He highlighted the issue of access to teachers, of which there is a grave shortage, and the workforce issues in early years provision, which other members have raised. I have a daughter who has a qualification in early years education, which she achieved three years ago, but she has never worked in a job for which the qualification was required, as she does not see that as an appropriate way in which to pursue her career.</p><p>My colleague James Douglas-Hamilton and other members highlighted the requirement to target resources at specific needs. We all have an aspiration on the general provision of early years education but, in practice, needs differ in different areas and, to an extent, in different social groups. It is absolutely essential that we target early years provision in areas of deprivation. It is obvious that specific damage occurs as a result of social deprivation and that that must be addressed specifically through targeted additional resources. Another group with specific needs are working parents. James Douglas-Hamilton suggested that we should copy the voucher system that exists in the south, so that working parents can tailor the available care to fit their requirements and so that, when parents choose to put in additional resources, they are not undermined by having the advantage of the other resources, to which they contribute, withdrawn.</p><p>I was surprised to find myself in agreement with a great deal of what Rosemary Byrne said. The debate has been sensible and fair, but the bottom line is that the resources that are available for early years education must be targeted at improving quality rather than quantity.

I am in the unique position of being able to thank the clerks for their hard work in preparing four reports for the purpose of this afternoon's debate. It is surprising for such a large amount of material to be gathered together for one purpose, and it makes one realise how hard the clerks in the Parliament work at times.</p><p>Many people might assume that membership of the Procedures Committee is a less than entertaining experience, but we have had some interesting meetings and discussions, which have led to the production of the four excellent reports that I can recommend to the Parliament. I do not intend going through them in great detail, because we have already had the privilege of hearing the convener do that, and later we will be equally privileged to hear the deputy convener sum up at the end of the debate. However, I thought that it would be appropriate for me to mention a few events that took place during the preparation of the reports. Sometimes, even the Procedures Committee can be current and slap bang up to date in reacting to events.</p><p>That was the case when we were considering substitution. Our sixth report rightly deals at some length with substitution as it relates to the activities of members who promote their own bills and who are members of committees that consider those bills. As we discussed the suggestions for substitution in such cases&#8212;which is an important issue&#8212;we found ourselves in an unusual position. I believe that it was Karen Gillon who was not present for that day's meeting. Her substitute Irene Oldfather arrived at the meeting, only to be told that she did not qualify to act as a substitute on that day. Karen Gillon was definitely away on parliamentary business, but because she was not involved in business in the Parliament itself, she was not entitled to be substituted. It was important that the Procedures Committee took the opportunity to address that issue as part of that day's consideration of the subject of substitutions. I am glad that proposals have been made that clarify the position in such situations and simplify one or two other matters.</p><p>The committee took the view that the opportunity to provide a substitute should not be widely extended, because the privilege of substituting a committee member should be protected and should operate within fairly narrow limits. The proposed changes will not extend the current limits greatly and will simply allow us to accommodate what we all consider to be important parliamentary business.</p><p>I briefly read the Executive's response to the report on consolidation bill procedure. It appears <place-holder colnum=\"30787\"/> that the Executive does not entirely agree with the committee proposal that there should be the opportunity to debate consolidation bills at stages 1 and 3. I will not question that response now, but I am interested in hearing the minister's view in more detail at the end of the debate.</p><p>When the Procedures Committee was discussing the 20-day rule, I took the view that we should jealously protect the system in the Parliament whereby a strict timetable is adhered to for dealing with subordinate legislation that is subject to the negative procedure. I did not want the timetable to slip, so I supported the committee's initial rejection of the Subordinate Legislation Committee's request that we extend the 20-day period to 25 days. However, I am happy to support the proposal to make it clear that the Subordinate Legislation Committee will normally report to the lead committee within 20 days but that on some occasions it may report up to 22 days after an instrument is laid. That will allow the Subordinate Legislation Committee limited flexibility while helping to maintain a strict timetable for dealing with secondary legislation.</p><p>I support the convener of the Procedures Committee and add my support to the proposals for changes to the standing orders.</p>", "hdate": "2006-12-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13375399", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Procedures Committee (Sixth to Ninth Reports 2006)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In committee debates, it is traditional to take the opportunity to thank the clerks for their hard work in preparing the report.

It is the responsibility of every individual to do what they can; whether we are parents, youth workers or people who work on a daily basis with young people in a school or project setting, we must always have at the front of our mind the need to deal with the potential issue of knife crime and the ways in which young people may, mistakenly, become involved in it.</p><p>As we all know, many young people in Scotland carry a knife for the wrong reason.

As I have said on previous occasions, the fact that we have had a greater number of Green party members during the second session has resulted in their priorities becoming the priorities of the Parliament and, suddenly, of all parties. Although we may not agree on everything, I think that we agree on that.<place-holder colnum=\"30537\"/></p><p>An important point about how the Carbon Trust operates is that, as Sarah Boyack pointed out, it is worth while for big businesses to develop schemes and methods of reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. If an organisation has a multimillion-pound energy budget, it does not need to make many efficiency savings to make a big difference to its profits. As a consequence, big companies have quickly seen the sense of becoming more energy efficient and more CO<sub>2</sub> conscious.</p><p>The problem lies at the other end of the market, where very small companies might see the potential benefits of energy efficiency but are unable to find either the time or inclination to move down that road. For that reason, all parties have plans&#8212;this is certainly true of the Conservative party&#8212;to make that an issue in the next Scottish Parliament elections. Our party has plans, which I know are shared by other parties, to extend the efforts to encourage domestic energy efficiency and microrenewables into the small business arena so that small businesses are given equal levels of support.</p><p>Many comparisons can be drawn between the activities of the Carbon Trust and those of many other organisations, but it strikes me that, in certain respects, the trust's activities are similar to those of our enterprise companies. However, whereas our enterprise companies need to pick winners that will develop their contributions, the Carbon Trust is required to spread its effectiveness across a range of companies and public sector organisations in order to try to produce results everywhere.</p><p>Richard Lochhead raised an issue about the number of people that the Carbon Trust employs in Scotland. I do not believe that we should judge the trust's success on the number of its employees. If the trust can do the job with nine people, that is all the better as more money will then be available to spend on the investments that the trust believes are important and which are its reason for existing. However, if the trust needs more employees, we should consider that request. If the trust's activities need to be stepped up, it is certainly evident from the briefing paper that we get good value for money from what we currently provide.</p><p>I worry about Richard Lochhead's proposal that we should consider how to bring together the Carbon Trust and similar organisations into bigger organisations that would, it is perceived, do the job more efficiently. I am not inclined to agree with that, as I do not necessarily believe that big is beautiful. One man's duplication is another man's competition. I believe that competition can be successful in certain areas, including this one. Therefore, I am keen to have smaller organisations, working together where possible, <place-holder colnum=\"30538\"/> that can bring about the results that we know can be produced by the Carbon Trust and the other organisations that operate in similar or parallel fields.

On many occasions, it has prevented us from taking the steps that the industry has agreed are essential. In some cases, those steps might have involved taking measures even more draconian than those that were taken, but they would have been enacted in a more timely and less severe fashion and they would have achieved the results that we wanted.</p><p>As Eleanor Scott pointed out, fisheries ought to be controlled by those who are affected by them. The problem with the current common fisheries policy is that it allows those who are not affected to become actively involved in the control of fishery regions. That is why we were so enthusiastic in our support for the 2001 EU green paper that proposed regional management of European fisheries. What a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, the regional advisory committees that eventually materialised from that proposal are toothless and have little or nothing to contribute to the sustainable management of Europe's fisheries.</p><p>I have another couple of points to make about what the minister is trying to achieve in the negotiations. At a meeting that one or two of us attended earlier today, fish processors pointed out that the current circumstances are not easy for processors to tolerate. In the current year, haddock with an estimated value to the industry of &#163;30 million and prawns with an estimated value to the industry of &#163;35 million will remain uncaught. Talk about increasing the quotas could be quite irrelevant if we cannot achieve the current quotas.</p><p>Processors want to see some relief on the restrictions on days at sea. They understand that reduced effort is necessary to reduce catches, but the problem is that simply not enough days are available to our fishermen to catch the quotas that they have been allocated. It is essential for the processors that some flexibility is built into the system. At the moment, processors do not get the fish that they need, they do not get them sufficiently regularly and they cannot build up reserves in their freezers to cover the quiet periods. Quite often, boats may not go to sea for long periods when the weather is bad because the <place-holder colnum=\"30327\"/> fishermen want to save up their days for when the weather improves. That position is as economically unsustainable as some of the positions that we have discussed today are ecologically unsustainable.</p><p>It is interesting that the same speakers who criticise the Conservatives and the SNP for the position that we have taken often go on to support our position in the remarks that they make and the examples that they give. It was interesting to hear Richard Baker say that he believed that Scotland's fishermen have already done more than their fair share. That point was backed by Jim Wallace and it is one that we can all understand and subscribe to. Sadly, although we hear people talking about methods of reducing both discards and the bycatch of smaller fish, those methods are not being evenly employed across Europe's fishing industry.

He said that it is a sound socialist principle that help should go to those who are most in need. I do not dispute the fact that help should go to those who are most in need; I dispute the idea that it is an exclusively socialist principle. It has been a traditional Scottish principle and certainly a sound Christian principle&#8212;one that many of us have pursued in our lifetimes and one that has been pursued over generations.</p><p>For that reason, it is difficult to argue that, considering the priorities faced in Europe today, the money that has traditionally been allocated to development programmes in Scotland should not now find its way into eastern Europe. We are all going to have to learn to live with that. That does not mean that it is any easier to deal with. I would not like to face the problems that the minister might face in justifying his decisions.</p><p>The priorities and problems have been highlighted by a number of members. Chris Ballance got a bit of a rough ride from some members of Executive parties earlier in the debate when he raised the issues of the south of Scotland. Sadly, the truth is that if we are to reprioritise&#8212;which will be necessary as priorities are assessed&#8212;some will lose more than others. I <place-holder colnum=\"28705\"/> was going to say that there will be winners and losers but, as we know, there are no winners in regional terms.</p><p>For that reason, it befalls the Executive to consider its administrative procedures carefully. If the funds are cut&#8212;as we know they will be&#8212;it will be necessary to ensure that administrative costs are cut by at least the same percentages. It is disgraceful that when organisations' budgets have been cut in the past, their administration costs have gone up instead of down. We cannot afford for that to happen. The money that is available must go into projects that justify the expenditure. We must get more bang for the buck.</p><p>That still leaves huge gaps. We have heard today about the situation that Aberdeenshire faces and how little recognition there is of the poverty that exists there. I live in the administrative area of Aberdeenshire&#8212;I will never call it just Aberdeenshire, because I still live in Kincardineshire&#8212;and it is obvious that there are radical differences. In the south of the area, we are much wealthier than those in the north. Those who are close to the city of Aberdeen have good links and can boast a much stronger economy than those who do not have such links. Stewart Stevenson is not with us today, but he does an excellent job in highlighting the economic problems of north Aberdeenshire. Aberdeenshire faces a grave problem in the current round.</p><p>In spite of my sympathy, I must cast doubts on the Executive's ability to deal with the problem that it faces. It can point to the fact that the European Union has done it no favours, and many of the difficulties that it faces, particularly in the late announcement of the available funds, are not actually its fault. However, as we speak, another crisis is brewing in relation to the distribution of European funds. The Executive can perhaps be said to have more blood on its hands from the way in which Ross Finnie has chosen to distribute rural development funds. That problem is almost entirely of the Executive's making. Controversial decisions on how funds will be top-sliced and redistributed have proved difficult to get accepted by the European Union. As a consequence, many of Scotland's poorest farmers will find themselves short-changed. The interim measures for rural development funds that I believe have been announced today&#8212;some of which sound similar to the interim measures for structural funds that the minister has announced today&#8212;will be of no help to those who expected large amounts of money, because they will simply not materialise.</p><p>I close with a warning for the minister. The difficult situation that he has been left to administer may not be his fault, but the Executive must learn from the mistakes that it made in its proposals to distribute rural development funds. As the <place-holder colnum=\"28706\"/> administrative process for structural funds is changed, the Executive must ensure that it does not end up suffering from problems that are essentially of its own making. As I said at the outset, I do not regret the fact that I am not required to make the decisions that the minister faces, but I urge him to act quickly, decisively and clearly to ensure that the moneys are not delayed for a moment longer than is necessary.</p>", "hdate": "2006-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13369552", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Structural Funds Programmes 2007 to 2013"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I welcome the report.

I recognise the same arguments that were made against national parks in the past and which could still be made against terrestrial national parks today. It is surprising that all that hostility has come together at this time.</p><p>In the early days of the Scottish Parliament, when I was the convener of the Rural Affairs Committee and Sarah Boyack was the minister who introduced the National Parks (Scotland) Bill, it would not have surprised many if the Conservatives had opposed the proposal. However, we did not&#8212;we took a different tack. We chose to engage in the process across party lines with interested members of all political parties to work to ensure that economic interests were properly protected, that no group had the upper hand, that the position of those who sought legitimately to make their living in the new national parks would be protected from the start and that their position and that protection would be enshrined in the bill when passed. I think that all parties who were involved&#8212;the minister, the Executive, the committee and ordinary members alike&#8212;can claim a success.</p><p>There is still much to learn from the experience of the new national parks as they operate in practice, yet here we have a proposal, which does not surprise many of us, to establish the first marine national park. Perhaps we should regret that the opportunity has not been taken to carry out post-legislative scrutiny of the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000. However, that opportunity has passed and there is a proposal in front of us.</p><p>The Conservatives have made it clear that we are not opposed to the principle that we are discussing. That is important. We have also made the commitment that we will involve ourselves in the same process in which we involved ourselves in the past to ensure that we support people whose economic interests may be threatened by marine national parks. We will support them to ensure that the opportunities for economic advancement in a new marine national park will be protected, supported and promoted.</p><p>Several proposals have been made on where the first marine national park could be sited. Those proposals form a significant part of the consultation. Fergus Ewing has made it clear that his constituents do not want such a park; if that is the case and the consultation proves that they do not, I will fully support them in resisting a park. However, I do not believe that all the people in every area in which the consultation is taking place do not want a park.<place-holder colnum=\"28634\"/></p><p>We are at the start of a very long process that will, I suspect, result in the creation of Scotland's first marine national park. The Conservatives will not oppose such a park but will aim to ensure that it is established in a beneficial way. We must protect fishermen from potential interference but not prevent the potential investment that can be made if things are done properly and successfully in areas in which people want national parks. Once an area in which people want a marine national park is identified, we should not hesitate to go forward with and debate a bill that is based on the proposals.</p><p>As I have said, I am surprised at the hostility that SNP members have shown in the debate. I appeal to them to do what we are doing and what we did with the National Parks (Scotland) Bill seven years ago. They should accept that a marine national park is inevitable and take part in the process to ensure that it will not be an economic burden on the area in which it is established but will be a positive measure.

Its main cities are spread out over hundreds of miles and people's need to move between and around them is made more difficult by geography.</p><p>Scotland's economy depends more on transport, and on road transport in particular, than do many other comparable economies, including that of Sweden with which positive comparison has been drawn today. Scotland needs more roads and more road improvements. Ignoring climate change and carbon emissions for a moment, there is great demand and great necessity to improve road links, for example to Inverness from Elgin, where road transport is still difficult, as we have heard during the debate. We need to improve road connections to Stranraer, to benefit not only the south-west but Northern Ireland, which depends on those connections for access to ferry services.</p><p>We need the Aberdeen western peripheral route. The clear economic gap between the north and south extremes of Aberdeenshire is caused simply by the difficulties of getting lorries and cars past the obstruction that is Aberdeen. The case is clear: we can improve Scotland's economy by improving transport, and roads will always be a key part of transport links.</p><p>As members from many parties have said, a clear and present danger is associated with <place-holder colnum=\"28557\"/> carbon emissions and global warming.

For that reason, we need to look at a range of ideas and technologies, some of which are a long way off.</p><p>We heard good suggestions from Rob Gibson today about how road construction and maintenance could be made cheaper through the use of new technologies. We heard Ted Brocklebank speak at some length about the availability of technologies such as magnetic levitation and how that might make rail travel more efficient, but that is a very long way off.</p><p>What we can do is look at moving away from using fossil carbon as our source of energy on the roads. The first thing that we need to do is consider biofuels, because that technology is the easiest for us to grasp and include in our systems now. Roads are not the polluters and neither are cars; the polluter is the fuel that we put into our cars. Moving to biofuels is not easy to achieve. If we are to use a much higher level of biofuels, decisions must be made outside this Parliament about the level of taxation to which such fuel is subjected. In many other European countries, arrangements have already been reached under which, by virtue of lower levels of taxation, biofuels compete with, or are even more competitive than, the fossil fuels that they replace. The opportunity to introduce cyclical carbon-based fuels to power our cities' bus systems and make them carbon neutral is not beyond us.</p><p>I praise the Scottish Executive for the actions that it has taken so far to support the fledgling biofuel industry in Scotland. The first bullet that we all have to bite is considering how we can divert yet more resource to that important fledgling industry.

The additional motivation for those who work in the voluntary sector, which Frances Curran mentioned, is an advantage.</p><p>I cannot let this debate pass without returning to a discussion that was initiated largely by an intervention from Mike Rumbles, on the demotivation that young people experience as a result of unemployment. Yes, there have been problems with unemployment in the past, some of which were associated with policies of previous <place-holder colnum=\"28532\"/> Conservatives Governments. However, the statistics appear to indicate that if we get another four years of this Executive we could have more unemployed people in Scotland than we had when the Conservatives demitted office in 1997. That trend is further underlined by the fact that, today, we have an underclass of young people who cannot find employment in the jobs that they are qualified to do and find themselves instead working in relatively menial jobs. The physiotherapists who came to Parliament yesterday are a good example of that. Many of them are well qualified but cannot find work.</p><p>The truth is that our amendment has the same objective as the motion, but reflects a Conservative view. The amendment suggests that we have perhaps put too much effort into ASBOs and funding public services when some of the money that has been spent in that way would have been better spent on increasing the economic opportunities for young people who want only a toehold on the ladder that we have been able to climb.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13369057", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People and Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, not at this stage.

The fact that I suffered a recurrence of a bad back just 10 minutes before I came to the chamber this afternoon has reminded me how painful the condition can be, and I thank everyone who has expressed their sympathy over the past couple of hours. The pain of a bad back is over in a few days, but the pain and injury that are caused by knife attacks often take much longer to recover from. Indeed, sometimes the injury is fatal.</p><p>I do not usually speak on justice issues in the Parliament, so it is perhaps slightly out of character for me to initiate a debate on knife crime education. However, given that I want to talk about why it should be everyone's responsibility to try to deal with the problems of knife crime, it is appropriate that a new face and a new voice should be raising the issue.</p><p>Whether one believes knife crime is a growing problem depends to some extent on one's experience and to a larger extent on where one comes from. I have heard people from the south-west of Scotland&#8212;from Glasgow, in particular&#8212;say that knife crime is no longer the growing problem that it has been because of successful initiatives to tackle it, but people from other parts of Scotland are beginning to deliver anecdotal evidence that there is a growing problem in areas where knife crime has not been a problem before.</p><p>Research that was done for a newspaper article some 10 weeks ago&#8212;it is slightly out of date&#8212;states that the statistics on knife crime are truly frightening. Last year, there were 1,301 knife attacks in Strathclyde alone, 1,100 of which were in a public place and involved non-domestic knives. Scotland has the third highest rate of stabbings anywhere in Europe, with Glasgow as a significant stand out. In the past 10 years, 554 <place-holder colnum=\"28351\"/> people have died as a result of attacks involving a sharp object. That is roughly one killing a week.</p><p>During the summer recess, I found myself being approached by an Angus man: Mark Davies of Arbroath. He has considerable experience in the field. Not only is he a martial artist of some renown and the owner of a martial arts centre in Arbroath from which he operates outreach events in Dundee and Montrose, he is an international martial arts instructor and examiner, an edged weapons instructor and a close combat instructor with the United Kingdom special forces.</p><p>Mark Davies's experience with knives has given him some strong opinions, but he wanted to become involved in knife crime education not as a result of his professional background but when his nine-year-old son came back from school expressing his concerns about knife issues and the fact that another nine-year-old had threatened a friend of his with a knife. We should all be aware that the problem exists.</p><p>The programme that Mark Davies has proposed is&#8212;let us be clear&#8212;not a self-defence programme. It is not an attempt to encourage people to fight back. In fact, it is exactly the opposite. Mark wants to ensure that young people understand the real damage that edged weapons can do. I use the phrase edged weapons deliberately because, as Mark Davies states clearly in his programme, some of the most dangerous weapons that are carried are screwdrivers and other domestic implements that are likely to cause serious injury but are not suspicious unless they are in the hands of people who are suspicious.</p><p>We are well aware that the Scottish Executive has worked hard to try to cut knife crime. Efforts have been made to increase the level of deterrence. I and, I am sure, many of my Conservative colleagues, along with members in other parties, will support the Executive whenever it makes efforts to discourage knife crime through increased sentencing and better attempts to control knives.</p><p>The police have conducted a number of knife amnesties. Another successful one took place this year, but the problem is not with the kind of people who take advantage of knife amnesties. Although amnesties undoubtedly take dangerous weapons out of society and mean that they will not be available in future for those who are likely to cause damage with them, the truth is that the people who are likely to cause the damage are the ones who will not hand the weapons in.</p><p>When it comes to young people, it is clear&#8212;Mark Davies has made it clear to me and others in the Parliament whom he has met&#8212;that those who seek to do criminal damage with knives are in a <place-holder colnum=\"28352\"/> small minority. Sadly, the majority&#8212;perhaps a significant majority&#8212;of those who carry knives do so because they believe that it is a method of self-defence. They believe that they are threatened and decide to carry edged weapons to reduce the risk to themselves. Unfortunately, statistics and anecdotal evidence indicate that somebody who chooses to carry an edged weapon for that reason is more likely, rather than less likely, to be a victim of attack.</p><p>As I said at the beginning, it is important that we all claim the prevention and reduction of knife crime as our own. It is up to all of us as politicians to highlight the issues and to work against the problem. It is up to all parents to ensure that their children are neither carrying knives nor in fear of becoming victims of knife crime. It is up to the people in society who have genuine experience of the use of knives&#8212;perhaps they are few in number&#8212;to take the opportunities, when they arise, to go out and tell young people that it is not like it is in the movies: when someone pulls a knife and stabs someone else, they do serious damage not only to the victim but to themselves. Once they have crossed the line and become a perpetrator of knife crime, they will never be able to step back over it.</p><p>I take pleasure in speaking to the motion:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament encourages all efforts to reduce knife crime; notes that educational programmes and courses on the dangers of carrying a knife have been shown to have been successful in the past, and congratulates Mr Mark Davies from Angus on using his experiences as a door supervisor and martial artist to put together a new course which educates our young people on the dangers and possible consequences of carrying a knife.\"</p><p>We all need to learn more about the subject. The more people who are willing to do what Mark Davies has done in using his expertise, the more likely it is that we can progress towards an end to this scourge.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368856", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Knife Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "With the Presiding Officer's indulgence, I will speak from a seated position.

I should explain to other members that I mean no discourtesy. In the past half-hour, I have aggravated a back problem and, as a result, I will remain seated.</p><p>The Procedures Committee has produced the two reports that the Parliament is considering today. I will touch briefly on the report on motions and decisions. It was the view of all committee members that we were simply putting down in standing orders what had become the normal practice of the Parliament, and we wanted to ensure that that was properly understood and included in the standing orders. If any member has a differing view, I would be delighted to hear about that, but I suspect that there is little in the report that is controversial.</p><p>Neither, I suppose, is there much that is controversial in the other report that we are debating today&#8212;the consultation report on parliamentary time. The idea of publishing a consultation report is primarily to encourage as many people in the Parliament as possible to give us their views on issues to do with parliamentary time, because one of the greatest challenges that the committee faced was to ensure that anyone who might have had an opinion brought it forward so that we could include it for consideration.</p><p>There may be some members who take the view that our report is not particularly daring in its presentation of possible alternatives. Had we decided to publish the report two or four weeks earlier, it would have seemed like a much bigger body of work and some of its suggestions might have seemed more radical. However, some of the more radical suggestions fell by the wayside because we realised that there was no support for such changes. Suggestions for open-ended parliamentary sittings, for regular sittings on more days in the week, and for not having a specified decision time, so that we could debate into the night on the good old-fashioned Westminster model, were all discussed and all passed from our discussions without our feeling the need to include them in our report. The truth is that the appetite for <place-holder colnum=\"28303\"/> change in that area does not exist and, unless somebody speaks during the debate to encourage us to think differently, that is likely to continue to be the case.</p><p>However, there were one or two areas in which we felt that it was essential for us to make suggestions for change and to attempt to get the views of more members&#8212;particularly on the way in which stage 3 consideration has been conducted. Stage 3, if it is properly organised and if it runs to the timetabling motion, can run smoothly, leaving us all with the impression that everything has worked well, but there have, on occasion, been significant difficulties.</p><p>There are those who are opposed to the notion of timetabling motions entirely. Having been a member of the Parliamentary Bureau for two years, I realise that there is no malice involved in parliamentary timetabling motions for stage 3. Stage 3 consideration must be timetabled to ensure that we can stick to the proper parliamentary schedule. However, when that timetabling appears to be inappropriate&#8212;and we often discover that only at the last minute&#8212;it can seem as if someone is trying to stifle debate. It has never been my experience that any business manager has tried to stifle debate on any subject, but it can be embarrassing when important motions and amendments are discussed only by a handful of members when many want to speak or, even worse, not discussed at all before a vote.</p><p>For that reason, the one area in which flexibility is essential is in allowing time to ensure that amendments are properly discussed at stage 3. We have come close to making poor law at stage 3 of some bills before now, and we now have the opportunity to make changes so that that does not happen in future.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368740", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Motions, Decisions and Parliamentary Time"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you very much, Presiding Officer.

We make no apologies for following them into that area, because we realise that it will form the agenda for the future.</p><p>However, we must not make the mistake of thinking that this battle can be fought entirely through rhetoric, not on policy. We might be following the Greens' agenda, but we disagree fundamentally with them about how best to achieve its aims. I suppose that those differences could be described as the traditional ones between the right and the left. We as Conservatives will always seek to ensure that the policies of the right&#8212;which are, of course, the right policies&#8212;are put forward to achieve our broad aims.</p><p>That is where our eco-bonus scheme proposal comes in. I should point out that this is the third time in a row that energy and the environment have been chosen as the subject for Conservative party business. We have nothing to learn from other parties in that respect and the fact that the issue is not raised more often at First Minister's questions perhaps reflects his interests more than it reflects the interests of those who are asking the questions.</p><p>If we are not very careful, policies that are designed to achieve shared aims such as a reduction in global warming might have negative effects. For a start, we need the kind of economic growth that will keep our public services fully funded. Moreover, we also need to consider whether any energy policy that we develop will threaten the fuel security of the least well-off in society.</p><p>Our straightforward, honest and down-to-earth policies, such as the eco-bonus, will ensure that our industries and the least well-off in our society are able to participate in the revolution that must take place. Although it will provide only a small amount of money at the start, it is certainly a great deal more than has been made available so far. I should also point out that our policy aims to achieve much the same thing that Shiona Baird and Sarah Boyack want to achieve with their bill proposals. Shiona Baird was somewhat unjust in dismissing the Conservatives' attitude to those bill proposals. She is right to say that no Conservatives have as yet signed her bill proposal but, after discussions, we are now moving towards the position that is set out in Sarah Boyack's bill proposal. In fact, some Conservatives have already signed up to it. We believe that what Ms Boyack is trying to achieve is essentially much the same as what we are trying to achieve with the policies that we have set out this morning.</p><p>I am also concerned that certain parties in the chamber are moving in a direction that will have <place-holder colnum=\"27739\"/> genuinely dangerous long-term effects for our economy.

That is dangerous because we need policies that ensure that we do not suffer the consequences of variability and that, when we flick the switch, we get the power that we need at a price that we&#8212;including the least well-off&#8212;can afford to pay.</p><p>We have to be responsible about how we achieve these aims.

In the first two years of Parliament, I was convener of the Parliament's Rural Affairs Committee. With me on that committee were Lewis Macdonald, who is now the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care and is with us this evening, and Mike Rumbles.</p><p>At that time, all members of the committee said that it was important that we did not make the mistake of allowing that committee simply to become the agriculture and fisheries committee. Mike Rumbles worked hard and, with my support, secured resources in the committee to conduct a detailed inquiry into the broader issues of rural development. During that inquiry, it became clear that the provision of rural services and the consideration of rural development in a cross-cutting way were essential to sound rural development in the long term. The provision of health services&#8212;including specific health services such as maternity services&#8212;was seen as being key to the future of rural Scotland.</p><p>During the inquiry, the Rural Affairs Committee conducted a number of consultations. Of course, as many people will be aware, it was found that in some of the more sparsely populated areas of Scotland there is a need to provide local services. However, sometimes, genuine deprivation in some of the economies in Scotland can be disguised. It was a great disappointment to me when, in justification for its decision, representatives of NHS Grampian said that resources could be better targeted at areas of social deprivation. That is to assume that areas such as Aboyne do not require targeting of resources for that reason.</p><p>One of the clearest conclusions of the Rural Affairs Committee's inquiry all those years ago was that, in areas such as the north-east of Scotland, we should never make the mistake of assuming that, because there is some wealth, there is not also deprivation. For that reason, we must take into account the fact that areas such as Aboyne and the whole of Deeside as far as Braemar also suffer from deprivation in terms of public transport and a great many other things. For that reason, I encourage the Executive to take the view that was supported by ministers some six years ago, which is that rural development is important across a broad range of services, and that we should never allow the priorities of those who wish to centralise services and target resources on our cities to affect the provision of services for some of our most deprived communities.</p><p>I think that Aboyne has a good case for the defence on those principles.

I am not entirely sure that mine will be as profound as those, and particularly not as profound as the one we have just heard. However, in the spirit of the new politics, I would like to take this opportunity to praise the Scottish Executive and Jack McConnell for displaying a refreshing degree of honesty. No, I am not talking about the speech that the First Minister delivered earlier; I <place-holder colnum=\"27192\"/> am talking about a document that was published in the name of the Executive earlier this week, \"The Futures Project&#8212;The Strategic Audit 2006\". I quickly rifled through the document to get to the chapter on the environment. The chapter's introductory page has two bold statements. The first is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There are areas where we appear to perform less strongly\",</p><p>which is a terrific confession. That statement is followed by this one:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our record on the Environment indicates room for improvement\".</p><p>There is certainly some progress there.</p><p>It is true that, particularly in the past few years, the Scottish Parliament has become far more preoccupied with environmentally based issues, which is only right. That has been driven partly by the presence of the Green representatives in the Parliament&#8212;who have, as I have said before, become the green conscience of us all&#8212;and partly by the internationally recognised need to deal with major problems such as climate change and its primary causes. However, while trying to make progress in relation to the relevant targets, the Executive has, in some cases, found itself performing \"less strongly\", as it says. It is, therefore, important that we consider why that is happening and how we can make changes.</p><p>Many of us agree that if we are to deal with climate change, energy efficiency in the home and in business and the promotion of microgeneration will be essential. However, it remains important that the Executive addresses the charge that that will levy against individuals and businesses and how those who are least able to afford it can put money up front in order to reap the benefits.</p><p>It is also important that we make some difficult decisions in relation to clean energy. With regard to electricity generation, we know that the Executive has a 40 per cent target for renewables by 2020. However, the opportunities for Scotland to go further and generate the other 60 per cent of our electricity in ways that do not put CO<sub>2</sub> into the environment are also available to us.

It is entirely appropriate, therefore, not only that we should have a policy, but that we should have the opportunity today to discuss seriously the problems of that small country and our experiences of it. I am one of the few who have spoken so far who have not had the opportunity or the privilege to visit Malawi, therefore my understanding of the facts about Malawi may not be entirely the same as those who have had more experience. However, the concerns that I noted down prior to my speech seem to have been reflected in much of what has been said.</p><p>I wanted to raise one issue for which I was trying to find the appropriate word. As the word that I wrote down has been used already in the debate, I will use it too. That word is corruption. If we are to assist Malawi or any other nation that has similar problems, there is always the problem of what happens with the resources that are given to it by whatever means. I do not like the word \"corruption\", particularly in relation to what goes on in Africa. We have different standards. Decisions that are made by Government and quite often by individuals, whether they are involved in Government or simply as part of the economy of a country such as Malawi, are often provoked not by any desire to get rich quick&#8212;another phrase that I do not like in this context&#8212;but simply by the necessity to survive in a difficult environment. It is therefore difficult for us to balance the imposition of standards and structures that we see as appropriate with our parallel commitment to permit self-determination within a pluralist democracy. I am not entirely sure how we can walk that <place-holder colnum=\"27117\"/> tightrope. The Executive has my good will in trying to achieve that.</p><p>I am well known in the chamber for believing in markets. I genuinely believe&#8212;in this country and internationally&#8212;in the concept of the redistribution of wealth through trade. In her opening remarks, Patricia Ferguson appeared to support that concept. I have no doubt that she supports it in principle, but she went on to talk about the contribution that the fair trade system is making to the economy of countries such as Malawi. It is entirely appropriate that if we drink tea or coffee, or use sugar or cotton, from a country such as Malawi, we should pay a fair rate for what we are buying. It is ironic that a country such as Malawi is suffering from the reduced demand internationally for tobacco; Malawi's tobacco is not returning the profit that it used to return in the past. I raise that point not to criticise what the minister said&#8212;I support her in so far as that goes&#8212;but to raise an on-going problem, not only in Malawi but in many other east African countries. The economy of those countries is so agriculturally dependent that they are veering towards the production of cash crops and against the production of the domestic crops that can be staples in their diet.</p><p>A piece of history that comes to mind, relating to events much closer to home many years ago, is the Irish potato famine. If we study the history of the famine, we discover that there was no shortage of food in Ireland; the problem was that the vast majority of food that was produced in Ireland at the time was exported to the British mainland. When the potato crop failed, there was starvation in a country that should have been able to feed itself many times over. It is essential that we take steps to boost growth in the economy of Malawi and other east African countries.</p><p>However, we must take into account the fact that the pressure that we put on the Malawians to grow their economy&#8212;the pressure that we put on them by ensuring that they get a good return for the cash crops that they grow&#8212;also has the effect of putting them more and more into the dangerous position that Ireland experienced in the past. For that reason, although we need to join in the commitment that the Executive has made to trade with Malawi and other small African countries, we must prioritise that to ensure that growth in those countries happens across a broad spectrum of the economy&#8212;even if it is in the manufacture of schoolbags, which we heard about a moment or two ago.</p><p>If we force the Malawians to depend on agricultural output, they may achieve a little growth&#8212;they may achieve a lot of growth if we pay them a fair price for their products&#8212;but we could imbalance their economy yet further. Any attempts that we make to encourage economic <place-holder colnum=\"27118\"/> growth in Malawi must also support non-food production, for both internal and external reasons.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13365823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Development and Co-operation with Malawi"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If saving a country such as Malawi from the grinding poverty that it obviously suffers from was easy, perhaps it would have been achieved already.

However, we must reflect on the fact that Scotland has a relatively good record on animal welfare. Therefore, there is nothing in the bill that should not impact positively on those who keep or who are responsible for animals. It is interesting that the great debates that we have had during the passage of the bill have not been about whether ensuring animal welfare in particular policy areas is good or bad; they have been about how we can best legislate to ensure that animal welfare is upheld. There is no greater example of that than the debate on tail docking, in which people have lobbied consistently for a considerable period on the basis that tail docking is for the welfare of working dogs because it ensures that they are not subject to tail injuries in their working environment. I am glad that there will be further opportunity to make representations before the secondary legislation is introduced.</p><p>That leads me to one of my concerns about the bill, which is about the volume of decision making that is yet to be done through secondary legislation. It is good to have a debate in Parliament about amendments and suggestions, but it is difficult to offer input in the secondary legislation process, particularly with instruments that are subject to the negative procedure, in respect of which the only option is to move for annulment. It is important that we ensure that the debates that have begun today are continued and widened when the secondary legislation is produced and considered.</p><p>On disease outbreaks and similar circumstances, I am pleased that the minister will have the right to act on the spur of the moment. I saw closely what happened during the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak some years ago, so I know that it is absolutely essential that ministers have the right to act. Thereafter, they will be accountable to Parliament, but they must not be required to consult before decisions are made. I am therefore delighted that we rejected the idea of an across-the-board plan to which ministers would have to stick at times of crisis. It is essential that ministers have the right to decide in the event of an emergency.</p><p>I am pleased that we have addressed a number of other issues, including circuses. I had hoped to participate in the debate on that, but unfortunately did not push my button in time. It is important that in the future we address the issue of wild animals being kept by, and travelling with, circuses. There is no place for wild animals in circuses. However, circuses have a role in celebrating the symbiotic relationship that has for millennia existed between human beings and certain other species. For that reason, I am concerned, when Mark Ruskell starts talking about wild animals, that he includes elephants. Outside Africa, throughout the rest of <place-holder colnum=\"26208\"/> the world, elephants are more a domestic than a wild species.</p><p>There is some dispute about what constitutes a wild animal, but the legislation has attracted unanimity in most areas.

I will not change that: this has been a very useful debate.</p><p>The debate has been particularly useful for me because I learned something of value. The Minister for Parliamentary Business made it clear that she has indulged in conversation on this subject with business managers and others in the Parliament. I was involved in one of those conversations. I can tell members that my role tended to be to listen. The debate has been particularly useful because the formality of Parliament has allowed a true exchange of views. Nevertheless, parliamentary procedure will&#8212;as ever&#8212;deliver the last word to the Minister for Parliamentary Business.</p><p>It became obvious during some of the opening speeches that there has been a glut of legislation since the Scottish Parliament came into being. I once heard it said that there are those in Scotland&#8212;not only in the Parliament&#8212;who believe that we have been catching up on a 300-year backlog. Anyone who has sat on any of the major committees in the Parliament could well believe that 300 years'-worth of legislation has been passed during the past seven years.</p><p>The minister said that the Parliament has passed some 95 bills. I agree with Jack McConnell and Susan Deacon: it is perhaps time the Parliament learned to do less, better.</p><p>Timescales seem to tax most minds, particularly that of Donald Gorrie. Now that he has become the convener of the Procedures Committee, the issue will go up the parliamentary agenda accordingly.<place-holder colnum=\"24005\"/></p><p>It is particularly concerning that so many members have expressed worries about whether the parliamentary process permits proper scrutiny. There are issues about the adequacy of scrutiny during the pre-legislative stage 1 process. Many members have also made a good case for the introduction of a report at stage 2 to inform Parliament about what happened during that stage. That would sit well with the excellent stage 1 reports that are already produced and which we debate at length in Parliament. However, the matter that has caused most concern&#8212;and has done for some time&#8212;is how the stage 3 process operates.</p><p>Stage 3 provides us with an excellent opportunity to consider amendments at length, but one or two things that have crept into the process cause grave concern. The first, which has been discussed in the past and which Tricia Marwick raised today, is the fact that, occasionally, amendments appear at stage 3 that have not figured in the consultation process. If Parliament is asked, on the final day of debate before the bill is passed, to pass judgment on matters that were not part of the bill at any previous stage, there is a grave danger that we will pass law that is inappropriate, inadequate or bad.</p><p>The second issue, which has become Donald Gorrie's hobby-horse and on which I increasingly agree with him, is the fact that we do not give adequate time to stage 3. I know what Donald Gorrie has said about that, but I also know that during the two years when I was a business manager in the Parliament there was never at any stage an attempt to prevent time being allocated to discussion.</p><p>If the Parliament's ideals are to be adhered to, and if we are to keep the family-friendly notion, it must be possible to predict when business will finish. Consequently, timetabling motions become a kind of necessary evil. However, I increasingly take the view that we are in danger of passing bad legislation by pursuing that particular practice.</p><p>I will not offer members a solution, but I will say that Donald Gorrie has ensured that we will consider timetabling in the Procedures Committee's inquiry report. I will take my place in the process to ensure that we take radical decisions on recommendations about how we might best achieve some kind of expansion of time. I must say that Carolyn Leckie's suggestion that we could have more time without using up any more of the parliamentary day takes us into the theory of relativity a bit further than I was previously prepared to go, but if we are going to warp time perhaps we could not do it for a better reason.</p><p>The debate has been interesting and a number of issues that the Parliament must address have <place-holder colnum=\"24006\"/> been raised. If we are to make legislating a sound process, we must do less, better. We must spend more time on bills, particularly at stage 3. We must have more time to consider amendments at the latter stages.

To add greater detail to that, it is a business that relies mainly on the dairy industry. It is also my duty, therefore, to apologise to Sarah Boyack for the fact that, as a farmer, I may well continue the doom and gloom that we have experienced so far in the debate.</p><p>There is cause for that, but not exclusively so, in the motion that lies before us. In effect, we have had two debates this afternoon: a debate on the forward strategy and a debate on the industry&#8212;an industry that unfortunately seems to be dying an untimely death. The new forward strategy document is based on a strategy that Ross Finnie, the Minister for Environment and Rural Development, has followed for a number of years. It sets out all the basic means by which the industry can be defended and can make progress. That is done against the backdrop of Executive decisions last year and the year before. In many ways, those decisions corresponded with what we were encouraging the Executive to do, which has allowed us to move our farming industry significantly closer to the marketplace than it has been for many years. However, on the darker side, that change to market reality has coincided with a series of events that have led to what I fear may be market failure. That is why any verdict on Scotland's farming industry would have to be that, if it dies, it may have been death by misadventure.</p><p>Let us consider what the minister said in his speech. He made all the right noises. He said that <place-holder colnum=\"23936\"/> farms are still very important to rural Scotland. As Sarah Boyack said, nobody in the chamber will argue with that. Farming should be the bedrock of our rural economy. Whether it is in primary production or in secondary food processing, there should always be opportunities to create jobs in rural Scotland through the farming industry.</p><p>Ross Finnie also mentioned partnership with stakeholders; the whole process that he has gone through reflects that. He wants farming to be competitive in markets; but there we find the difficulty beginning to arise. He gave us the good news that the less favoured area scheme is likely to survive the current round of negotiations. He also mentioned the rural stewardship scheme&#8212;which is something of a concern to me, because, as has happened in previous years with predecessor schemes, there is not enough money to go round.</p><p>Some in the farming industry are gravely concerned that money that is largely raised through the modulation of pillar one measures is then used in such a way that some get money back but others do not. The Executive must take steps to do what Conservatives have been asking for many years; it must ensure that pillar two schemes can deliver the same money to the same people, but for doing radically different things. The shortfall in the funding for the scheme this year means that that has not happened. As a result, farmers will be less and less willing to accept modulation in years to come.</p><p>One of the best bits of news that we have heard for some time is the lifting of the beef export ban. However, as Andrew Arbuckle pointed out, the news is perhaps not as good as it might have been. The successful days of beef export were when the value of our currency made us strong exporters. If we are to regain that export market, it will be with one hand tied behind our backs if our current currency values continue. I therefore ask the minister to take the opportunity, either today or soon, to outline the advice and assistance that can be given to people who are seeking to establish export markets within the liberalised regime that is now available to them. That will allow us to set about restoring our markets, even if we find ourselves going up a hill in our efforts.</p><p>Members have raised subjects that are worthy of support. I liked Richard Lochhead's defence of the dairy industry&#8212;I will thank him for that every time he mentions it. In a very good speech in support of an amendment in which I find nothing to disagree with, he spoke about regulation. John Swinney also spoke at some length about regulation. Both of them did us a service.

When I go around talking to farmers, biofuel is one of the subjects that they want to talk about the most. It is not something that has been widely produced in Scotland in the past, but it is something that Scotland's farmers are ambitious to produce in future. It is important that the Executive and the minister take every opportunity to streamline the process by which support&#8212;whenever it is available&#8212;can be made available to farmers and farmers co-operatives to underpin the development of biofuel. The production of biofuel will be a major industry in future. Although it may not produce the massive profits that we would like, it will provide a welcome floor in grain and oil-seed rape markets.</p><p>I support those members who called for the return of live exports. I understand why many people disapprove of that practice but, as a young man starting out in the farming industry, my experience&#8212;which I have mentioned to members on previous occasions&#8212;was that every life was precious and that every calf that was born on the farm was to be protected. A generation later, when my own son was the same age, he took every second calf that was born round the back of the steading, shot it and buried it in a hole. If that is animal welfare, it is not the kind of animal welfare that I want to support. The reinstatement of the export of live calves is something that everyone who understands its importance will be keen to support.</p><p>The debate has been difficult and, in some respects, dark.

For the avoidance of doubt, members will see that I am not only a farmer but a partner in my family farming business, which is based on dairy farming and other livestock interests. I am also a member of several organisations that hold many and various opinions on the bill.<place-holder colnum=\"23466\"/></p><p>While we are considering the bill, we must consider its purpose. The object of the exercise is to improve animal welfare. As a consequence, we must concentrate on what is about animal welfare and what is being driven more inappropriately by public opinion. During his opening speech, Richard Lochhead did us all a favour by raising the subject of public opinion and its effect on how we think about animal welfare and how we should frame legislation.</p><p>We must be decisive in how we do this job. We need to ensure that we are dealing genuinely with animal welfare and not legislating on the welfare of animals simply to salve the opinions of certain elements of the public who have been affected by some very disturbing images in recent years.</p><p>The first issue that we must address is the impact of the foot-and-mouth outbreak. We have seen that in public opinion and we also see it in the bill, to some extent. Being a livestock farmer, I would be the first to say that the minister must retain the power to act swiftly and decisively in the event of an outbreak of a virulent disease such as foot-and-mouth. It is absolutely essential that Parliament does nothing that will slow that process in passing the bill. If it does something that means that we would have to go through a complex consultative process before ministers could demand slaughter or other action, I would not support the bill.</p><p>At the same time, I am concerned that the minister repeatedly states that he would never take such decisions without first taking veterinary advice, but that is not written in the bill. It is unreasonable for the minister to deny Parliament the right to place it in the bill. With the proviso that I have suggested about the speed of the minister's decision-making process, I believe that it is essential to get that on the face of the bill.</p><p>In the same area of the minister's decision-making powers, I am concerned about some of the changes to the opportunity to use vaccination as an alternative to slaughter, particularly in circumstances such as a foot-and-mouth outbreak. I have had experience of vaccination and the attempt to control disease in farmed animals. The attempt to use a vaccination programme to eliminate brucellosis from Britain's cattle population affected my business. Animals that were vaccinated to prevent them from getting or carrying the disease were indistinguishable from animals that had or had had the disease. Consequently, when I first became a farmer in my own right in the early 1980s, I was still having cattle taken away and destroyed because of inconclusive results of brucellosis tests. That happened entirely because animals had been vaccinated against the disease. Therefore, it is essential that, before we use vaccination as an <place-holder colnum=\"23467\"/> alternative to a slaughter policy, we are absolutely confident that there is no confusion between an animal that is vaccinated and one that has the antibodies as a result of exposure to the disease itself.</p><p>In the evidence, it appears that there are hopes that scientific advances might deliver improvements in our ability to distinguish between the two situations. However, when the minister mentioned that in his opening remarks, he appeared to make it clear that many of those scientific advances are not yet with us. Therefore, we should not vaccinate cattle against foot-and-mouth disease in similar circumstances in Scotland without first having a 100 per cent guaranteed way of distinguishing between the vaccinated and the previously infected. If we go down the road of vaccination without having the ability to differentiate, Scotland's farmed animal population could find itself isolated for generations to come. Economics mean that Scotland's farmers cannot afford for that to happen.</p><p>A couple of other issues have been raised during the debate that I cannot allow to pass. One thing that I would not have mentioned had it not been mentioned by Irene Oldfather is circuses. Over the years, I have often seen wee lassies outside circuses handing out bits of paper that are designed to encourage people to think that keeping animals in circuses is inappropriate. I am the first to agree that the presence of wild animals in travelling circuses is entirely inappropriate. At the same time, I have to stand up and say that the symbiotic relationship that exists between certain species and the human race goes back to well before civilised times. It ought to be celebrated on a cultural basis. When it comes to dogs, horses and, perhaps, even elephants and camels, there is a good case for the Parliament and the Executive supporting the continuation of the use of animals in circuses in properly regulated circumstances.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by drawing members' attention to my entry in the register of members' interests.

I do not want to dwell on it, but I will make one comment. Across the country, and particularly in the veterinary profession, there has been a long-running debate on the docking of dogs' tails. I am the first to agree that we should be opposed to the docking of dogs' tails for cosmetic reasons; it is unjustified on welfare grounds. However, the docking of working dogs is quite a separate debate. Before we pass the legislation, it is important that we have an adequate opportunity to consider the docking of working dogs for welfare reasons, and we should treat that issue entirely separately. The BVA's views are predicated on the debate about companion animals and do not necessarily relate to working dogs. Vets who work with working dogs agree, almost to a man and a woman, that dogs should be docked if their welfare is in danger because they are not docked.

Although I am concerned that no great announcements were made, it is has been a practical and sensible way to use an hour of our time. I have found the debate reassuring.</p><p>My concern has always been to ensure that we appreciate all that the voluntary sector contributes. I remember hearing Carolyn Leckie speak in a previous debate and heaping great praise on the voluntary project that was under discussion, but she suggested that, ultimately, the public sector is always better than the voluntary sector. Rosie Kane said that again today about certain projects. I have never taken that view. I continue to believe that the voluntary sector is capable of providing services as good as&#8212;if not better than&#8212;those of the public sector. That is why it is important that we all accept that the voluntary sector is not only here to stay, but is something that we should encourage, fund and develop where possible. I took from Malcolm Chilsholm's speech that he believes that too. He certainly said nothing to discourage me in that belief. That is why I take something positive from the debate.</p><p>However, several serious and significant points have been raised to which I will add my support. The first concerns funding. Many of the voluntary sector projects that we all visit in our constituencies face the same problem: three-year funding. Many of them depend on finding grants, and they live from one year to the next without knowing whether they will be able to continue. I <place-holder colnum=\"23234\"/> regularly visit Angus young carers' project in Arbroath. That is an incredibly worthy organisation, but it never knows where its funding for the year after next will come from. For that reason, I have the greatest sympathy with much of what Donald Gorrie said about funding.</p><p>Alex Fergusson was perfectly right to say that volunteering makes a major economic contribution. Volunteers freely give billions of pounds worth of effort. Without them, the country would be a lot worse off. However, there continues to be a problem in encouraging people to become involved in volunteering, particularly those who are less well off, unemployed or on benefits. Consequently, because some areas in Scotland are better off than others, there are certain areas in which there remains a shortage of volunteers.</p><p>That takes us to some of the things that David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative party, recently said about volunteering. He is no new convert to the concept of volunteering. In fact, through his personal circumstances, David Cameron has been involved with voluntary organisations for many years. That is why he has become highly motivated by the idea that volunteering should be encouraged. Listening to the minister's opening speech, it is clear that many of the things that David Cameron is talking about in the south are already further along the road in Scotland than they are in England.</p><p>However, we must address the key issues, which perhaps need to be dealt with in the south as well. As many have said in the debate, we must ensure that volunteering provides those who have had health difficulties or who have been unemployed with a stepping stone&#8212;as Patrick Harvie said&#8212;back into work. However, that means that there must be a more understanding attitude towards the payment of benefits, particularly unemployment benefit. The combination of being on benefits and doing voluntary work should be as smooth as possible. Volunteering should not be seen, as it is by many in difficult circumstances, as a barrier to continuing to claim benefits.</p><p>The debate has been extremely useful. I have heard some positive contributions, not least from the minister, and I support the position that he set out. I hope that the debate will encourage others in the chamber to support their local voluntary organisations and to bring the message of those organisations back here in future.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13355857", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Volunteering"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There was some question in the early part of the debate as to whether this was a constructive or an appropriate time to debate volunteering.

It is, therefore, important that the minister gives us a commitment that she will at least consider the situation that has been brought about and the injustices that appear to exist. For example, some halls that have not been adjusted since 1999 still have their charitable status, while those that have been built since then are struggling to cope with their water bills.

Local taxation has been a bane for many in Government, including those who are in the Parliament today and those who represented Scottish constituencies in the past.</p><p>The Council Tax Abolition and Service Tax Introduction (Scotland) Bill is designed to make local government taxation a centrally organised and defined procedure. We must remember that, to some extent, we already have such a procedure. A large proportion of the money that is paid to and spent by local authorities is raised by central taxation, so we have already had our experiment with that approach. What it has got us is local government that is not properly accountable to the electors. We would do well to reflect that fact in any decisions that we make after today's debate. Any changes that we make to local government should add to local accountability, not detract from it.</p><p>Mark Ballard and the other members who spoke about that made a lot of good sense. I would probably disagree with Mark Ballard on some of the tax proposals that he would make, but I certainly agree that the solution to many of our problems is to broaden the local tax base and to spread the load more widely, not to concentrate it in the hands of fewer and fewer individuals. That will not necessarily protect the people who we think we are protecting.<place-holder colnum=\"22923\"/></p><p>If we suspend disbelief for a moment and imagine that the general principles of the bill are agreed to at stage 1, we will get to the stage that Tommy Sheridan mentioned earlier. He suggested that we could lodge amendments at stage 2 to make the service tax a more local tax. However, where would that get us? If we move towards a local income tax&#8212;such a tax is supported by a number of parties in the Parliament&#8212;who will end up paying it? If I consider income tax payers in the area that I come from, it seems that the people who are likely to face the biggest burden are those who are at the stage of life when they have families, mortgages, pension contributions and insurance premiums to pay&#8212;and all the other burdens that families typically have. If both partners work, two people would be paying local income tax. The danger is that we might concentrate significant amounts of additional taxation on the very people we want to help.</p><p>I have a great deal of sympathy for pensioners and, whatever we end up doing, we must remove the burden of local taxation from pensioners who are unable to pay. Tommy Sheridan talked about millionaires in his opening speech. I know only one or two millionaires, but they are above the pension age. Are we suggesting that some of the wealthiest people in the country should be exempt from paying the service tax? We must think more rationally about how we will structure local taxation in future.</p><p>One or two other aspects of local taxation concern me. Those concerns come from my experience of dealing with environmental matters in the Parliament. I increasingly take the view that redistributive taxation pays for too much of what we fund through our local authorities. The time has come to look at what we pay for through taxation and what we pay for on the basis of how we use services. If charges were made on the basis of use, we would influence people in this country to make better use of the available water and sewerage provision, which we have to finance.</p><p>Similarly, a lot is being done to encourage people to be more responsible about recycling. I know how important it is, but we would recycle more and do more to save our environment if we were charged by volume or weight of the material that we put out for the bin men. That charge should reflect use and should not be funded through local taxation.</p><p>As I come from a rural area, I constantly get my ear bent about the fact that people there pay the same council tax as people in towns, yet rural areas have no street lights, no buses and bad roads. The quality of their services is extremely poor, yet they get no advantage when it comes to paying local taxation.<place-holder colnum=\"22924\"/></p><p>I have covered areas that other members have perhaps not discussed. I am the first to agree that our current system has come about as a result of a series of incidents in which the Conservative party played its part during its years in Government. However, the solution to the problem is not simple. We must work together to find a fair way to levy local taxation, but that is not as easy as the bill suggests</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13355108", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Council Tax Abolition and Service Tax Introduction (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I am sure members are aware, there is no need to tell a Conservative that, when we talk about local taxation, we are walking on broken glass.

Some of us in the committee might have been prepared to vote the proposal through at a much earlier stage.

My experience is that although an awful lot of people in the community are largely untouched by justice issues, there is a fear building among them that those issues are not being addressed properly and, consequently, the fear of crime is greater <place-holder colnum=\"21567\"/> than the possibility of being touched by it directly.

As a member of the Parliament, I have visited my local prison, Aberdeen, many times over the past six or seven years. In that time amazing steps forward have been taken. The inmates were not quite sewing mail bags the first time I visited, but I did see someone making a fishing net in one part of the prison. During my most recent visit, I saw that that part of the prison has now been completely redeveloped, so the prison can begin to work on some of the problems associated with drink and drug abuse and, in particular, assisting people to get back into work.</p><p>The problem is that, too often, people go into Aberdeen prison, begin the programmes and are then released under the automatic early-release scheme. Not having completed the programme successfully, they find themselves back in prison in three or six months' time for committing a similar crime to the one that they committed previously. Members have raised concerns about that already, but I draw slightly different conclusions. First, quite often, early release is of no benefit to the individual concerned, particularly if they have been involved in a programme that might have dealt them serious advantages had they been able to complete it, which is not always possible.</p><p>As Kenny MacAskill said, 77 per cent of prison admissions are drink or drug associated. My experience of visiting Aberdeen prison does nothing to indicate anything different.

When we consider the turnout of MSPs for some events, 60 is an extraordinary number. The quality of the food was therefore all the more important&#8212;those who went along enjoyed high-quality food and drink. I am not sure whether it is within the rules, but I think that some business was done that night and that some food and drink left in plastic carrier bags.</p><p>The object of Scottish food fortnight is to promote Scottish food. The fortnight ran from 17 September to 2 October. The event on 5 October marked the end of activities. During the fortnight, attempts were made to promote good-quality Scottish food at farmers markets all over Scotland. Good-quality Scottish products were also promoted at a range of restaurants and local shops throughout the country.</p><p>We must take the opportunity to consider the aims of Scottish food fortnight. Some five weeks later, it is a good time to reflect on the priorities that the fortnight was designed to promote. One main object was to nurture a renaissance in the pleasures of preparing and eating locally produced food and drink. Another aim was to help the flow of <place-holder colnum=\"20657\"/> readily available low-fat healthy food to enter the Scottish diet. Locally produced materials fit into that category because they are, of course, not processed as other foods are.</p><p>Other objects of Scottish food fortnight were to increase awareness that Scottish food is of the highest quality and meets the most stringent safety standards and to build awareness that buying Scottish food and drink in season and in particular when produced in small volumes by speciality producers will result in large-scale support for farms, small rural businesses and independent shops.</p><p>Another object of the fortnight was to highlight the ridiculous number of food miles that our food runs up. By strengthening local food networks, the shortest possible chain can be created between producer and consumer. One intent was to preserve local independent retailing and catering, by encouraging Scottish people and visitors to Scotland to buy regional speciality food and drink from small shops, pubs, hotels and restaurants. Another aim was to promote the goodness of Scottish game through endorsement of the new Scottish game marketing initiative.</p><p>More than 100 food businesses from throughout Scotland took part in the fortnight and 23 farmers markets were held in the two weeks. The average footfall per market was 4,000, which is very encouraging. As I said, the farmers market in Holyrood was a success. With speeches from Tony Andrews, the chairman of the Scottish Countryside Alliance Educational Trust, who helped to organise the food fortnight, and from Lady Claire Macdonald, who spoke about the quality of Scottish products, it was obvious that support came from across the board.</p><p>The farmers market movement in Scotland dates back to 1999. In the past six years, the number of markets has grown to more than 60. The estimated turnover for farmers markets is about &#163;20 million. Buying local food from local producers and retailers puts more money back into the local economy than does buying the equivalent goods from supermarkets. Statistics suggest that every &#163;10 that is spent locally benefits the local economy to the tune of &#163;25 when it is multiplied up, whereas it is worth just &#163;14 when spent in a supermarket. That is because vibrant local shops keep people in the area, which makes the local petrol station, bank and other facilities more viable. Also, local retailers employ local people, who will then spend their wages locally, which has a multiplier effect.</p><p>Another issue that it is necessary to highlight is that we sometimes misunderstand how the benefits of local products can be exploited. There are those who will argue in favour of organic products, for example. Although there is no reason <place-holder colnum=\"20658\"/> why organic products cannot be quality local products, that is by no means guaranteed; organic products on our supermarket shelves can quite often be guilty of having travelled as many food miles as any other product.</p>", "hdate": "2005-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13349276", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Food Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The farmers market came to Holyrood some five weeks ago with representatives of food producers from all over Scotland.

As well as replacing the regulations, the bill will extend the assessment regime to cover a wider range of plans and programmes than the European directive requires.</p><p>The Environment and Rural Development Committee approved the bill at stage 1, but it also highlighted a number of reservations. There is significant concern about the likely resource implications of extending the scope of strategic environmental assessment. The bill's explanatory notes refer to research that the Babtie Group carried out that estimates that the annual cost of SEA to the responsible authorities is likely to be between &#163;7 million and &#163;12.5 million per annum.</p><p>In written evidence to the committee, the Confederation of British Industry Scotland stated that it was \"very disappointed\" that the Executive would extend the European directive; it considered that that was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"at odds with is public statements that the economy is its number one priority,\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"counter to the commitments made to the business community by the UK Government that there would be no further 'goldplating' of EU legislation.\"</p><p>Even Scottish Enterprise stated in its written evidence that the bill should not undermine economic growth; it stated in oral evidence that its concern was based on the need to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"avoid adding to the process delays or excess bureaucracy that might slow down decision making.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Environment and Rural Development Committee Committee</em>, 27 April 2005; c 1833.]</p><p>In addition, there are serious concerns about the availability in the public sector of the skills that will be needed to implement the bill and about the likelihood of increased costs as external consultants are employed to take up the slack. COSLA, no less, suggested that, before proceeding with the bill, there should be a series of pilot projects to assess all the implications.<place-holder colnum=\"20483\"/></p><p>In considering the financial memorandum, the Finance Committee raised concerns about the high burden of costs that local authorities will carry as a result of the bill. In written evidence to the committee, Highland Council stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"budget constraints will force Local Authorities to choose between delivering frontline services and meeting their statutory duty to SEA.\"</p><p>The Finance Committee also raised the likelihood of a knock-on effect on forthcoming planning regulation changes and the planning system as a whole.</p><p>The Conservatives accept the need for a reasonable and unobtrusive amount of environmental assessment, but we believe that the provision under the existing 2004 regulations is adequate. We have grave reservations about the implications of the bill. We believe that the Executive is following the now familiar route of gold plating European Union regulation. The bill's provisions will impose another layer of unnecessary bureaucracy and will have enormous resource implications for costs and skills. Further, local authorities will be presented with another raft of regulation for which they will be expected to find up to &#163;12 million a year.</p><p>The bill's supporters argue that money will be saved and, in the long run, the prevention of damage to the environment will have a cash value. However, Scotland is not experiencing widespread environmental damage from our public bodies&#8212;the bill is the wrong approach.

For that reason, it is only to be expected that the behaviour and actions of <place-holder colnum=\"20219\"/> members of the Scottish Parliament should come under some scrutiny and be subject to freedom of information requests. However, the unhealthy, disproportionate interest in members' activities has contaminated the press in Scotland.

The number of column inches that have been produced in recent months in association with freedom of information requests about MSPs is disproportionate to that for which the genuine work of members has accounted.</p><p>As we have seen often, facts have been mixed with speculation, sometimes implication and a little bit of fabrication to make stories that do not hold water but have serious impacts on individuals.

Members of the Scottish Parliament jealously guard privacy. Consequently, we should be prepared to defend it where doing so is appropriate.</p><p>I said that I would be brief, and I intend to be. The actions that we have seen since the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 was passed lead me to suggest that the jury is still out on whether the legislation has been the success that the Executive believed that it would be.

Some people are surprised that any hostility arises at a proposal to reintroduce an animal such as the beaver, but much of our past experience with the introduction of alien species shows how easy it is to upset the ecology of an area. With the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, we took further action to control the introduction of alien species&#8212;both plant and animal&#8212;and attempts were made in the legislation to deal with some species that had been introduced in the past. That at least should make us concerned to ensure that we are doing the right thing before we take radical action.</p><p>Many people take particular species to heart and have gone to great lengths to protect them. For example, I know that there are an awful lot more <place-holder colnum=\"17140\"/> foxes now than there were in the past. There are also many more birds of prey. My local population of buzzards never ceases to amaze me, and the damage that it has done to ground-nesting birds, in particular the lapwing, is noticeable to anyone who observes such species. There is also a worry&#8212;although it is perhaps unjustified&#8212;about the precedent that is set by introducing species such as the beaver.

Not being a member of the committee, the issues in the report were new to me when I read through it briefly in advance of this debate. Perhaps what I take from it is somewhat different from what is taken from it by those who have applied themselves to its preparation over a considerable period.</p><p>The first thing that I take from it is that no political party or organisation has a monopoly on the solutions to the question of how we ensure that Scotland is perceived as a modern, dynamic nation. Yes, we have our tartan and shortbread image, which is something that we must play on; we can turn our back on no advantage. At the same time, however, the Conservative party has always believed that, to make Scotland's presence abroad as strong as possible, we must have an image of being a modern and dynamic economy. That is why I will return to the criticism that we have levelled in many other debates on many other subjects and suggest that the best way to ensure that we have that image is for the Scottish Executive to ensure that Scotland has that modern and dynamic economy, which we all want it to have.</p><p>Some of the recommendations in the report are things that we should all understand. Having listened to Richard Lochhead's contribution, much of which I agree with&#8212;although I will never agree that independence would make things better for Scotland because I suspect that it would have exactly the reverse effect&#8212;I believe that it is important that we and the Executive accept the report's recommendation that we actively encourage United Kingdom organisations that have a significant part to play in how Scotland is perceived to understand what there is to promote about Scotland and to go out and actively promote it. We need to ensure that those organisations do <place-holder colnum=\"16952\"/> that because, as an active participant in the UK, Scotland pays its taxes and should expect such bodies to work for us as well.</p><p>There is always an argument against duplication. In the context of this debate, I would say that duplication can be a problem when we seek to promote Scotland in ways that should really be managed by the UK Government. Again, I do not believe that Scotland needs an embassy in every capital and perhaps some more besides, but we need to concentrate on how Scotland is promoted abroad. I was interested to read an article in the Daily Express that concerned Jack McConnell's attempt to promote Scotland by claiming that it is the best small nation in the world. I am happy to support Jack McConnell in that&#8212;we aspire to be the best small nation in the world, even if we are not quite there yet. The irony is that that story highlighted some of the ignorance that exists abroad. I was interested to read that a Mike Tait, a spokesman for the Jersey Tourist Board, suggested that Jersey was also an important place because it had some great cows and some very tasty potatoes.

Those are the weapons that we ought to concentrate on primarily. The motion before us is confused and somewhat naive in how it lumps all firearms together.</p><p>Earlier, Cathy Jamieson made clear a point that the Conservatives can agree with. She said that legislation is robust, should be dealt with on a UK <place-holder colnum=\"15693\"/> basis and that actions taken in this Parliament and recently in the Westminster Parliament cover many of the issues that have spurred the SNP to lodge this motion. Specifically, the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, which has been mentioned by a number of people, created a new offence of possessing an air weapon or imitation weapon in a public place without reasonable excuse. In itself, that should be enough to manage the problem of air-guns and replica weapons. However, we need to ensure that the police are able to implement that law. I believe that the legislation is already suitably robust to enable us to regulate what we describe as legally held firearms and to enable us to begin to take action on the type of weapon that inspired the SNP to lodge the motion that we are debating.</p><p>We have heard a number of people, not least Annabel Goldie, talk about the importance of recognising that the situation in Scotland is different from and better than that south of the border. There is no argument that says that legislation based on UK-wide or English experience is likely to be unhelpful or inappropriate in Scotland. In fact, the evidence is that such legislation is likely to be valuable in Scotland and that Scotland's legislative requirements in that regard are no different from those south of the border.</p><p>It is my conclusion, therefore, that firearms legislation should continue to be set and administered on a UK-wide basis. That will ensure that we have a consistent understanding of how legally held firearms can be regulated. In the early part of last year, the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 delivered regulations that allow us to pursue the issue of air-guns and replica weapons. That means that we can now proceed against those weapons in such a way as to make those tragedies less common and, hopefully, end them altogether.</p><p>As Annabel Goldie said, the points in the Conservative party's amendment are covered adequately by the Executive's amendment, which we will support in the vote later today.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Firearms Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I will not.

Energy efficiency contributes to economic growth, <place-holder colnum=\"14690\"/> which we must all pursue, and so is a means to more than one end. It is simply good practice, whatever we want to achieve by it. For that reason, while the Conservatives were in Government, we began the process of encouraging energy efficiency. The Conservative Government took major energy efficiency initiatives, including the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995, which led to guidance being issued to local authorities in 1996 that was designed to secure an overall improvement in efficiency of 30 per cent by 2010. By 1997, when the Conservative party demitted office, more than 2 million homes had been assisted, at a total cost of &#163;350 million.</p><p>The Scottish Executive's warm deal replaced the Conservative Government's home energy efficiency scheme in July 1999. It is one of the areas in which I hope to highlight a slight difference of opinion. I am willing to stand here and praise the warm deal, because it has made an enormous contribution to many people in Scotland&#8212;the elderly, the less well-off and those who are in homes that are difficult to heat&#8212;but the change in policy had the effect of moving the emphasis away from the conservation of energy towards the provision of acceptable living conditions. I might argue that that was an acceptable compromise, but it was potentially counterproductive for energy efficiency.</p><p>Therefore, we must consider carefully the impact of building regulation on people who can ill afford to take on additional cost. Home energy efficiency is a potential cost and so could be a barrier to the provision of affordable housing. Whatever we choose to do to encourage home energy efficiency, it must not add cost. Shiona Baird already touched on that when she said that the whole-life cost of energy efficient housing is reduced, yet for many people up-front cost is the problem. Those least able to afford home energy efficiency might know that there is benefit to be had in the long term, but they do not have the resources at the outset. That is why Government and all parties in the Parliament need to consider ways to defer the costs and to assist those people.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334252", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy Efficiency"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate must be conducted in a positive spirit.

In setting up the water industry commission, part 1 in particular goes some way towards alleviating the pressures that we experience not only from water buyers, but from individuals who are concerned about how charges have been regulated across the board. By putting in place a system that will allow those people to be properly heard and represented, we have gone some way towards ensuring that some of the anomalies that we have suffered in the past can at least be addressed, if not eliminated. Therefore, I welcome part 1 of the bill.</p><p>Part 3 of the bill is also largely uncontested. Having questioned a number of interested parties on it during the Environment and Rural Development Committee's stage 1 inquiry, I am satisfied that part 3 is in the bill for the right reasons and I am happy to support its inclusion.</p><p>However, the Conservative party continues to have serious problems with the ideas behind part 2. As has been said, part 2 has the effect of concentrating power in ministers' hands and, as a result, our water industry is likely to remain policy led, not, as is necessary in many areas of Scotland, demand led. During the committee <place-holder colnum=\"14375\"/> stages and again today, the minister talked many times about the necessity for the industry to mimic the benefits that can be achieved through competition in a marketplace. However, he has never given me an adequate explanation of why the solution to the problem is not to deliver real competition.</p><p>The water policy as set out under part 2 of the bill is designed to retain the procedures by which water charging equates to a system of taxation throughout Scotland. It relies heavily on how water is charged, so that one individual cross-subsidises another. If we are to use water services provision as a system of taxation, which is without doubt what we are doing, there will inevitably be conflicts between those who use far more water than they are willing to pay for and those who pay for far more water than they ever use.</p><p>The opportunity to address such issues in part 2, even to a limited extent, has been avoided for largely ideological reasons and therefore the Conservatives cannot accept it.

The excess has been put out through the national grid to our neighbouring countries and it has been important to their economies, too.</p><p>We are fully aware that energy is not specifically a devolved matter, but so many of the issues that are discussed regularly in the Parliament are related to energy that it is essential for us to consider it as a uniting subject. That is why we brought forward today's debate. We must consider energy policy in the long term and ask how it is affected by the subjects that we discuss.</p><p>One of those subjects is climate change, which was debated in Executive time last week and on which the Environment and Rural Development Committee yesterday began a detailed inquiry. One thing that became obvious during last week's debate, and yesterday at the beginning of the <place-holder colnum=\"13936\"/> inquiry, is that there is now a great deal on which we all agree. No longer do we dispute that global warming is happening and no longer do we dispute that the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from industry and other sources throughout the world are part of that process. What we have to debate is how we deal with the problem and how we apply the means that are at our disposal to deal with it.</p><p>We must take into account the fact that Scotland has a developed economy. The need for a readily available and affordable supply of energy is indisputable. When we consider the problems that other countries have suffered, such as the power cuts in the United States and parts of Europe in recent years, we realise that we are in a lucky position because we are not exposed to such effects. If we believe that growth is the key to our future economic stability, we must be able to supply affordable electricity. It is therefore important to consider, in the context of our broader energy requirements, the balance of how that electricity is generated.</p><p>Estimates of future consumption are repeatedly disputed. I&#8212;and, more recently, my colleague Phil Gallie&#8212;have asked questions about those estimates and the need for spinning reserve within the generating capacity in Scotland. It is therefore a surprise to discover that Jim Wallace has only recently indicated that a study will be undertaken to work out what percentage of wind energy is usable in the Scottish electricity system. It is surprising that that comes rather later than the commitment to move towards ensuring that 18 per cent of Scotland's electricity comes from renewable sources by 2010, with an ambitious target of 40 per cent by 2020.

The truth is that the Conservative party has shown genuine commitment on the issue; this is the second time that we have brought the matter to the chamber. Our record speaks for itself.</p><p>John Home Robertson was keen to raise the performance of past Conservative Governments. Indeed, the options for change review, which took place in the 1990s, made certain attempts to merge regiments, not least in my own area. As John Home Robertson rightly mentioned, the Gordons were subject to merger. I was an active part of the campaign against that merger. I take great pride in the fact that I spoke out against the merger then and I am proud to speak out against it again today. That merger served to give us a valuable lesson, which we need to ensure that we learn here and now.</p><p>The north-east area, which I represent, covers an area in the north, which recruits for the Gordons&#8212;or traditionally did&#8212;and an area in the south, which recruits for the Black Watch. It is easy to compare the amount of reaction in those two areas to the campaign against merger. I have taken great pride in going out on the streets of Montrose with my good friend Sid Mather to collect signatures in support of the Black Watch to try to head off this disastrous amalgamation. However, there has been hardly a peep from the area in the north that traditionally recruited to the Gordons. Above all else, that indicates that the sense of regimental loyalty, which has been retained by the Black Watch&#8212;and which is important to the commitment that our Army gives&#8212;has been lost in the area in the north as a result of the merger of the Gordons.<place-holder colnum=\"12991\"/></p><p>We must remember that what we are debating is not only the merger of the Scottish regiments. As our motion makes clear, we are experiencing an across-the-board cut in defence expenditure that will have a significant and serious economic impact throughout many areas of Scotland, not least in places such as Moray where two airbases could be threatened over time. Given that economic responsibilities are firmly in the Scottish Parliament's area of responsibility, it would be irresponsible of us not to address the issues.</p><p>We need only think back to the performance of the squadrons at RAF Kinloss and to the number of fishermen and seamen's lives that have been saved in the north Atlantic and North sea as a result of the efforts of the Nimrod crews that are based at Kinloss. One can only worry about how such safety measures will be implemented in the future. I am sure that all members share those concerns.</p><p>We are concerned that the proposals to merge the Scottish regiments are mirrored in other parts of the British Army, not least in the Royal Marines. In the constituency of Angus, which is represented by my colleague Andrew Welsh on the benches opposite, we also have RM Condor, which is an important base for 45 Commando squadron. From the reports that are being circulated today, it would appear that the Royal Marines are likely to be subjected to the same kind of merger that the Scottish regiments are experiencing, with all the potential impact on areas such as Arbroath if the base is closed or changed significantly.</p><p>The impact that Arbroath has had on the role of the Royal Marines over the years never ceases to amaze me. I remember being on holiday in Poole in Dorset and being surprised to find that all the young women who worked in the hotels there had Arbroath accents. Once I had spoken to them, however, that was not hard to understand. They told me that many of them had married marines and had, over time, been transferred to Dorset.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament has a responsibility to ensure that we address the issues that are before the chamber today. We have heard from members such as Mike Rumbles who have genuine experience in the Army. A number of members have also had experience in the Territorial Army.

I can defend myself against that accusation by informing <place-holder colnum=\"12846\"/> members that I was only 10 years old when I was supposed to have signed away the rights, so I could not personally have been responsible.</p><p>However, we must deal with the accusations that have been made. I was too young at the time of the cod war to be aware of it, so I have had to read the history. My understanding is that, at the time of the cod war, Britain claimed responsibility for fisheries only up to the 12-mile limit. We could not claim up to the 200-mile limit, of course, because we were disputing that limit with the Icelanders. When we joined the common market, we negotiated a derogation that gave us back the rights to our own fisheries. Our fishermen would not have stood for anything less. Consequently, the Conservatives' hands are clean on that issue. In fact, it was under the prime ministership of Jim Callaghan that progress was made towards the situation that we suffer today.</p><p>We may be seeing again that kind of reinterpretation of history in the accusation that the Conservatives and, to a significant extent, the SNP are taking an irresponsible position in our suggestion that we could be better off if we were outside the CFP. In defence of that position, I must point out to several members who have spoken in the debate&#8212;Mark Ruskell, Richard Baker and Tavish Scott&#8212;that they do not understand what we are talking about. Their simplistic interpretation of our position is more likely to arise from political opportunism than from an honest misunderstanding.

We suggest that we trust our scientists, our fishing industry and our minister to make the decisions. That would mean that we would have a range of options ahead of us.

As an Opposition party in the Parliament, we are diametrically opposed to much of what the Executive does. However, that has never been our purpose when we discuss aquaculture. I impress upon the Executive that we fully support the views that it has expressed on the issue. I commend the work of former minister John Home Robertson, who has vigorously defended the aquaculture industry in the Parliament over the years, and of Allan Wilson, in his time as the minister who defended aquaculture in the Parliament. I also commend Alasdair Morrison, who always takes the opportunity to defend vigorously the interests of the salmon farming industry, which has a base in his constituency. So that my list is not completely dominated by Labour Party members, I commend Fergus Ewing for his work in defending the salmon farming industry's interests.</p><p>Not everything in the garden is rosy. As we heard from the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development at the outset of the debate, the aquaculture industry in Scotland, particularly salmon farming, continues to have major economic problems. I welcome the minister's announcement that the European Union will conduct an inquiry into the cost of production in Norway, with the aim of ensuring that we have some kind of level playing field on which to develop the market for salmon. The issue of Norwegian dumping of salmon on to our market has been the centrepiece of just about every debate that we have had on the subject. I believe in fair and free markets, but when such activity takes place, a healthy and wholesome industry that has much to deliver in improved eating and economic benefits must be protected from unfair competition.</p><p>There is much that we can do. The Executive motion and the minister acknowledge that there is a problem with regulation. We do not suggest that regulation should be cut away completely; we know that the environmental impact of salmon farming is causing increasing problems that must be dealt with. However, the minister's promise to streamline regulation, if it is achieved properly and quickly, could deliver major benefits for the industry. We support that move in principle. The regulatory burden is an identified problem for the aquaculture industry and we must accept it and deal with it.</p><p>The crossover impact of fish farming has been mentioned in previous debates on the subject, but it has not yet been mentioned in this one. We have not addressed the issue of how farmed fish are fed or the fact that our successful industry is based on <place-holder colnum=\"12501\"/> a requirement to maintain a largely industrial fishery that operates in the North sea and the north Atlantic. We have an insoluble problem in that respect, which we must try to address and to which we must find solutions in the longer term.

My entry shows that I am a farmer but, to give more <place-holder colnum=\"12254\"/> full information, I should say that I am a dairy farmer and am a contracted supplier to Robert Wiseman Dairies.</p><p>It is interesting that the Greens should have lodged the motion that we are debating today, given that it relies heavily on much of the information that the NFU Scotland has put to the Parliament through its lobbying in recent weeks and by other means. That said, having heard some of the opening speeches in the debate and some of the comments that members of the Green party have made in their interventions, it seems that they decided to focus the debate on their belief that we should be attacking global capitalism. The Greens are trying to prevent the benefits of free trade from filtering down to the ordinary people who benefit from the existence of supermarkets. People use supermarkets because they provide quality at competitive prices. Supermarkets also allow people to spend a much smaller proportion of their income on food than was the case in the past.</p><p>For example, the town of Arbroath in the north-east of Scotland has only one supermarket at the moment to serve a population of about 25,000 people. Several applications have been made to build another supermarket in the town&#8212;indeed, quite some competition has emerged to get permission to do that. The consistent view of the people of Arbroath and the surrounding area is that they want another supermarket, because they want competition in the retail sector in the town. They do not want to have to go out of the town to benefit from cheap supermarket food, which is a benefit that is acquired through competition.</p><p>Although I believe that supermarkets serve an important purpose in the production of cheap food, I also agree that there is a problem with them. In that regard, I turn to Fergus Ewing's remarks about the abolition of the milk marketing boards. Given that he does not have my experience of going through that process, I remind him that undertaking collective bargaining on behalf of the farmer was not one of the roles of the supermarket, whereas the role of the milk marketing boards was to set a price that was acceptable to processors and buyers. Ultimately, their role was to guarantee the survival of the farmer, but they had to do that at the same time as guaranteeing that the price of milk was kept down.</p><p>As a result, in the early 1990s, a lot of pressure was put on the Government to end the regulatory process and allow the market to deliver a fairer return. I can vouch for the fact that, after the milk marketing boards were abolished in the autumn of 1994, milk prices rose&#8212;not by a little but by a lot. In my experience, the price of milk rose by 22 per cent to a peak in early 1997. That rise in price was the benefit that came from releasing milk <place-holder colnum=\"12255\"/> production from the regulatory process. However, those who bought milk were not subject to the same regulation as those who sold it. Consequently, the opportunity was taken more recently to manipulate the process through which milk passes before it is sold to the consumer. At the end of the day, the process has ensured that too much of the profit lands in the hands of the retailer and not nearly enough in the hands of those who are lower down the process.</p><p>If we are to follow the terms of the motion in this debate about supermarkets, I agree that we have to talk about regulation and competition, but therein lies the problem: we need to ensure that we have a regulatory environment that allows fair competition across the board, which means that those who produce milk in Scotland need to act for their own benefit. Action is happening in that respect&#8212;I refer to the attempt to integrate the interests of co-operatives and those of the processors that is under way as a result of First Milk Ltd taking a shareholding in Robert Wiseman Dairies. In a small country such as Scotland, we can never afford to believe that one company can actually hold a monopoly. I hope that the link between First Milk and Robert Wiseman Dairies is the start of an integration that will be fruitful in the long term.</p><p>Dairy farmers need the support of the minister, who said that his department has had discussions with the Office of Fair Trading. We need to ensure that he makes strong representations on behalf of Scottish dairy farmers and that he takes the opportunity to point out the imbalance that has emerged in the market.</p><p>An inquiry was held in the House of Commons into the milk trade. Having looked at the committee report, perhaps through rose-coloured spectacles, I feel that the wool was pulled over committee members' eyes on that occasion. The supermarkets seemed to manage to give the distinct impression that somebody else&#8212;and not them&#8212;was profiteering.</p><p>However, the facts speak for themselves. Milk prices have fallen back from the peak in the mid-1990s to only 17p or 18p a litre, the level that the majority of farmers are being paid today. The margin that is being made by the dairy companies is clearly identifiable, because they publish their profits and the number of litres that they process in a year. It is clear that companies such as Robert Wiseman are making at or just under 2.5p per litre for processing milk.</p><p>As a consequence, somebody, somewhere, is soaking up 18 pence of the typical milk price and the only suspects are the supermarkets. If we are not to see a level playing field in competition regulation, we will have to look closely at the implementation of the supermarket code of <place-holder colnum=\"12256\"/> practice. In the first instance, if it can be enforced through negotiation, it can be made to deliver for farmers.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food (Supermarkets)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by drawing the attention of members to my entry in the register of members' interests.

I am always pleased to thank people such as Mark Brough, who made the effort to accommodate the one member of the committee who did not seem to see eye to eye with the other members on one or two issues.</p><p>That is where I will begin to deal with the stage 1 report, which serves to remind me why I got involved in politics in the first place. Unlike many experiences that I have had in the Parliament, I agree with many of the minutiae that are contained in the bill. I agree with the details that have been put in place to achieve the process that the Executive has sought to pursue. For instance, I am perfectly happy with part 1, which sets up the water industry commission for Scotland. I am delighted with the information that the Minister for Environment and Rural Development has given us today and with his commitment to extend the powers of water users' representatives so as to feed into the process. I am also perfectly happy with the provisions of part 3, which addresses the need to control coal-mine water pollution. With the powers that have been added to the bill, the measures are sensible, and they will receive my support.</p><p>The real problem&#8212;and where I have a problem with what the Executive is trying to achieve&#8212;lies in part 2. I see the bill as introduced as being not about extending or defining competition in the water industry in Scotland, but about simply preventing competition and serving to protect a monopoly that is already in place. For that reason, I dissented from the committee's stage 1 report in three places. The first of those is paragraph 60, which seeks to prohibit common carriage. The committee agreed with that principle, but I dissented in a minority of one. Again, in relation to paragraph 63, which represents an attempt to prohibit retail competition in the domestic sector, I dissented from my committee colleagues. Paragraph 180 states:<place-holder colnum=\"11906\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Committee recommends that the general principles of the Bill should be agreed to.\"</p><p>Once again, I chose to dissent. That is why the Conservatives will vote against the motion today.</p><p>The reason for the Conservatives taking that line is fairly straightforward, and the line is consistent with that which we have taken previously on water legislation. The model for competition that has been proposed is, unfortunately, just that&#8212;a model. It misses the point about real competition. Our political opponents like to think that our support for competition is all to do with profit and loss, but the Executive ignores the fact that competition is also about supply and demand. We hear people such as John Swinney complaining about a failure to provide services where the demand exists. That is a prime example of the necessity of having a system that is more responsive to supply and demand.</p><p>The Executive argues that retail competition for household supply would force a change to the current system, under which local authorities bill domestic customers for their water and sewerage charges. That would mean that water charges would no longer reflect the customer's ability to pay. Although we on the Conservative benches agree that it is essential that everyone in Scotland should have access to water and drainage services, we believe that the correct way to address that in the future is not by institutionalising the principle of cross-subsidy, which the bill seeks to do, but by seeking ways to reflect it, ultimately, through the benefits system, if that is what society wishes to achieve.</p><p>Furthermore, charges should reflect the amount of the service that is used, as in England, where the denationalisation of water companies has resulted in 24.8 per cent of domestic users being billed on a metered basis, compared with less than 1 per cent of domestic users in Scotland being metered. That arrangement has the double benefit of people being given a greater incentive to save a precious natural resource and their receiving reduced bills, given that the average metered household bill in England and Wales is now 15 per cent lower than the average unmetered household bill.</p><p>The Executive's excuse for prohibiting common carriage is that it wishes to safeguard public health, but it appears that there is no justification whatever for that point of view. In fact, not a shred of evidence was presented to the committee to suggest that the practice would present any such danger. By prohibiting the common carriage of water, we are missing an opportunity to gain efficiency in the marketplace.</p><p>My experience is that we already have difficulties with managing water quality in <place-holder colnum=\"11907\"/> Scotland. Members might know that, given that I am a dairy farmer, I have been required in the past to ensure that my water, which is publicly supplied, is tested if there is any danger on the quality front. Consequently, I know exactly what I am being delivered through the public water supply, which can be frightening at times.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Services etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the clerks for their hard work during the evidence-taking process and for writing up the stage 1 report.

The effect is that the industry is run on the basis of public subsidy and, in some cases, good will. The public forestry industry in Scotland keeps the industry alive, but the private forestry industry, which the motion and all the amendments support in principle, is struggling to compete in a system in which production at a loss has become the norm.

If the use of wood prevents the alternative of burning fossil fuels, it is worth while. I am in the process of throwing out an oil-fired central heating system and replacing it with a wood-fired system. It is getting very cold at home because I am having difficulty finding a plumber, but that is a different matter.</p><p>We can increase the value and quality of timber production in Scotland by ensuring that, when we cut trees, we use the best-quality timber for building purposes and the poorer-quality timber for other jobs. If using that poorer-quality timber for firewood&#8212;in one way or another&#8212;is the best way in which to recover value, we should do that. However, one problem is that there may be a question as to whether that use will be acceptable under the system of renewables obligation certificates in the future.</p><p>I have corresponded with ministers on that subject and I would like guarantees, either today from the minister or in the future, that Scotland will not be disadvantaged by the fact that while grant aid is available for the provision of short-rotation coppicing south of the border, no additional grant aid is available for such schemes in Scotland. The argument is that we have a great deal of surplus timber. Scottish Coal has raised with me its concerns that it might find it difficult to compete in the future if it is not allowed to use surplus timber from Scottish forests in the provision of combined fuel that its competitors in the south are providing using short-rotation coppice material that is heavily subsidised by the Westminster Government.</p><p>Nora Radcliffe pointed out that our forests have an environmental, economic and social benefit to deliver to us. I am concerned that, in certain quarters, the social benefit might get too much attention. I am aware of the social benefits of Scotland's forests, but we must consider the long-term economic benefit as one of the highest priorities.</p><p>Looking at the budget proposals that have been made available to the Environment and Rural Development Committee in recent weeks, I am concerned to see that it is not planned to increase over time the amount of money that is set aside for new planting. I am aware that it is normal practice for the replanting of forest areas to be a condition of a felling licence, but I am concerned that in the north-east, huge areas of forest are currently being clear felled.

I will not do that. I am saying that it is important to be able to compare like with like, which is not always possible if the criteria change.</p><p>I will examine some of the impacts of general expenditure on the rural economy and raise concerns about likely impacts. I was glad to hear the minister's commitment to economic growth as an important principle and I will continue to support that, but I am concerned that some elements that are creeping into the way in which money is spent in the Scottish Executive may undermine growth in the rural economy.<place-holder colnum=\"10704\"/></p><p>I will give a couple of prime examples, the first of which has been dealt with to an extent in the passage of the Water Services etc (Scotland) Bill, when the opportunity has been taken several times to raise concerns about the water services system in areas of rural and peripheral Scotland, especially in relation to the distribution of housing. The system's failure to deliver enough resources to expand sewerage services, for example, has created a de facto planning system in some areas. As a result, it is difficult to find not only affordable housing for many people in rural Scotland, but opportunities to provide any housing at all.</p><p>Another problem that continues to grow disproportionately in rural Scotland concerns the provision of health services. In this debate and others, it has been said that hospital closures are making it increasingly necessary for people to travel considerable distances to access the health services that they are entitled to expect.</p><p>Another impact of health services on rural Scotland arises from the imposition of change in out-of-hours services for general practitioners across large areas. Many who live in the most peripheral areas are seriously concerned about that change, which has been driven not directly by budgets, but by changes that cost money and are consequently budget associated. The change is beginning to cause grave concern among people who wonder where their doctor will be and how far they might have to travel to see him in an emergency.</p><p>I am grateful that the minister announced his intention to establish a concessionary travel scheme that covers the whole of Scotland, not only for older people, but for young people. Many people who have suffered from the anomalies that the current patchwork has delivered will receive that gratefully. However, in huge parts of rural Scotland, the practical way of going from A to B remains the private car. That can be demonstrated in the many areas in which, if one sees a bus, the chances are that only one or two people are on it. As a consequence, we must highlight the continued failure to maintain some rural roads and highlight the impact that fuel prices continue to have over large areas of Scotland in which fuel prices may be the same, but greater distances are involved and transport costs are disproportionately higher. If a high proportion of the money that we spend on fuel is taxed and a person travels more miles, they will pay more tax. That is not how the tax system should operate.</p><p>Another pressure that continues to grow is that on rural local authorities. I am tempted not to be too sympathetic towards people who make decisions that are designed to be provocative. However, it is ironic that, where school budgets and school transport budgets continue to be a <place-holder colnum=\"10705\"/> burden on local authorities, that results in some of our best rural schools being threatened. Today, I heard that Dun School in Angus is the next small rural school to be threatened in that area. It is essential that the Parliament continues to represent the needs of people in rural areas who have often been educated in small schools, but are put under pressure by local authorities that are themselves put under financial pressure in respect of how they provide education.</p><p>I will finish by touching on two specific issues&#8212;the beef national envelope, which is proposed under the common agricultural policy review, and the land management contracts, which are under consultation. Those are significantly redistributive elements in respect of how they handle funds that are allocated to Scotland's farmers. My continuing concern is that, unless we can find ways in which to deliver systems that take modulated money and essentially offer the opportunity for that money to go back into the hands of the farmers from whom it was originally modulated, we will have a rebellion among those farmers on our hands. I urge the minister to encourage the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to reconsider those schemes so that we can get a fairer distribution.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13323975", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Spending Review 2004"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Was that an invitation to blame the Finance Committee?

As we sit here before many veterans of the armed services in Scotland who have come to the Parliament to demonstrate their views, we must remember the service that they have given the United Kingdom. It is for that reason that I remind members that the United Kingdom has had a role in the past that was more than simply defending its borders and that that role must continue in future. We should keep that clearly in our minds as we decide what will happen with our nation's army.</p><p>I come from the north-east of Scotland, which is divided into two parts. The southern part was traditionally a recruiting area for the Black Watch, while the northern part was traditionally for the <place-holder colnum=\"10648\"/> Gordon Highlanders. The comparison of the two is important and should be done. It has been my pleasure to go out on the streets of Montrose with my good friend Sid Mather, who is in the public gallery today, to collect signatures from people who are genuinely concerned about the future of the Black Watch regiment. A huge campaign has been built around the Black Watch by people such as Murdo Fraser and his colleagues in the Perth area. <em>The Courier </em>newspaper has been great at supporting the campaign.</p><p>The area further north used to recruit for the Gordon Highlanders, but that regiment was merged in the recent past and the successor seems to have lost part of the identity and loyalty that the traditional regimental system delivered. We should keep that comparison close to our hearts because if we make the mistake of ending our traditional regiments and dissociating loyal regions from the regiments that recruited there, we will be in grave danger of undermining not only the ability of our regiments, but the traditions that support them.</p><p>It would be inappropriate of me not to raise what is perhaps a side issue&#8212;that of 45 Commando in Arbroath. In a letter to me, Adam Ingram, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, made it clear that 45 Commando may be under threat as part of the review. Given that I represent the north-east of Scotland, I think that it is essential that we consider not only the interests of our regiments, but also the tradition that the marines at 45 Commando have had in the area. We must do all that we can to defend their tradition and presence in Scotland in the long term.</p><p>It is important to remember that the United Kingdom has responsibilities that involve heavy defence expenditure. It has been mentioned during the debate that some regiments have in the past been threatened by the diversion of funds into important projects and it would be remiss of me not to point out that we are in exactly the same situation today. Decisions must be made about the provision of aircraft for our air force and about aircraft carriers for our navy and aircraft to go on them. Huge amounts of military expenditure have been or will be committed in the not-too-distant future.

However, I will criticise him on the way in which he seeks to deliver some of his policy priorities. I greet the significant investment in infrastructure, but the message has not yet dropped adequately with the Executive that that infrastructure requires yet more investment in specific areas. I am glad that the Executive now has a road-building programme that is beginning to approach that which the Conservatives had in Scotland prior to 1997. However, unless the Executive understands that the way to solve Scotland's economic problems is to improve our road networks still further, the Conservatives will continue to argue for individual road developments. There are those in the chamber who believe the old adage that new roads just create new traffic. I assure them that one man's traffic is another man's economic expansion, which is what, by improving transport links, I want to happen in Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"10274\"/></p><p>Yet there are other elements of infrastructure that continue to give trouble in Scotland and they demonstrate how the Scottish Executive is perhaps beginning to drift off the mark. We have a problem in the fact that Scottish Water has become the de facto planning authority over large areas of Scotland. That is, in effect, caused largely by the fact that we in Scotland continue to try to exert political power in areas that are best led by the market. A demand-led water system would be much more desirable than one that is led exclusively by policy from the centre. That is an example&#8212;there are many others&#8212;of the fact that the Executive talks a good game on markets, yet is afraid to deliver decisions into the hands of the marketplace and continues to restrict the development of the Scottish economy.</p><p>We need look no further than the discussion that took place at the start of the debate. An argument developed over the comparative rate of growth in the Scottish economy, yet the distinction was not made between growth in the Scottish economy that is delivered through private enterprise and that which is funded directly through Government expenditure on the provision of services. The latter, we must remember, is largely funded through a disproportionate transfer of resources from the Westminster Parliament via the block grant. We must always remember that, in the Scottish economy, we tax at a proportionate rate to the rest of the UK, yet we spend well in excess of that. Unless we can wean ourselves off that disproportionate contribution to our economy, we cannot take the figures for growth in Scotland as representing like for like. The Conservatives will happily agree with the Executive that it is important that we continue to judge our economy against that of our nearest neighbours and partners south of the border but, unless the Executive is willing to accept our amendment, it is difficult for us to accept its motion.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13322869", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Growing Scotland's Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Did I use the phrase \"fiscal flexibility\"?

For that to happen, we have to guarantee that, when a factory opens its doors and switches on its power plants, it will be supplied with electricity.

Many people cite such a situation as outdated and fragmented and would like the creation of a single marine act to encompass all the challenges that face the marine environment. The Conservative party supports a sustainable development policy that is aimed at empowering the individual, increasing choice and creating incentives to be environmentally responsible, while reducing the power of bureaucracies. Current environmental legislation tends to work in the opposite way, empowering Governments and quangos, which often brings people and the environment unwillingly into conflict. The Conservatives understand the call for a single marine act and we tentatively support such a move, as long as it is approached in a balanced way and is not exploited by those who wish to impose their centralised solutions on the Scottish people. However, I will strongly resist any moves to remove the sea bed from Crown Estate management.</p><p>The environmental lobby claims that the current management of the marine environment is out of date and fragmented. While the structures and legislation may be fragmented, I do not necessarily agree that the legislation is out of date; rather, it has evolved organically over time, according to need, so it is likely to be largely fit for purpose. Therefore, I disagree with calls for radical reform and fundamental changes to our marine laws, policies and governance, as they are probably unnecessary.

However, an integrated approach might mean that we lose the <place-holder colnum=\"8497\"/> ability to prioritise when difficult decisions arise, as they will when groups come into conflict on access to the marine environment. That relates particularly to the oil industry, which, it is argued, is largely unsustainable and difficult to fit into a sustainable management policy. I fear that there may even be a hidden agenda among some groups. They must ask themselves what role they see themselves having in the structure and process. I suggest that environmental groups may take their place alongside other sectoral interests whose role I seek to protect. They may see themselves taking an overarching position, dealing directly with an arms-length supervisory and regulatory body and pushing for environmental considerations to be given greater priority than economic or social ones.</p><p>I strongly disagree with calls for a lead body to be put in charge of planning maritime affairs in Scotland.

At times, it has been polarised, but I am glad that the Executive chose to see it as an enterprise debate rather than an environment debate. The Conservative party's policy on renewable energy and the generation of electricity as a whole will always be based on the fact that we need to ensure that this country can continue to provide an affordable and adequate electricity supply to underpin a growing economy. There are members in this chamber who do not believe that growth in the economy is important&#8212;[ <em>Interruption</em> .]&#8212;but for the vast majority of us, growth is so important that we cannot afford to take the radical risks with our electricity supply that John Farquhar Munro appears to be taking with his hearing aid.</p><p>It is extremely important that we realise that we are talking about the stability of our future. The Deputy First Minister said in his opening remarks that it is important that we look on renewable energy production as an opportunity for industry. It is not just an opportunity to expand into renewable energy technology: our energy policy underpins the whole of our economy. That is the point on which the Conservatives' decisions will always hinge.</p><p>When Jim Wallace went through the Executive's five main challenges, he said that he wants to reach the target of 40 per cent renewable energy by 2020. That is a worthy target for any Government to set and pursue, but I am convinced that it is unachievable. Yet, accepting that moving towards that target will benefit the industry, I am <place-holder colnum=\"7729\"/> prepared to accept that there is benefit to be had. He also said that it is important to develop a range of technologies. I could not agree more.

I agree, but that is why we need a range of technologies. The target that has been set will not be achieved, but it will cause distortion in the industry.</p><p>I agree with members of the Green party and others who have made clear how important it is for us to reduce energy use wherever possible. Energy efficiency is something that we must all understand is part of the process. I am the first to admit that, too often when I speak on the subject, I do not mention energy efficiency. Should I ever do that again, members may be assured that I do understand its importance. The Conservatives will continue to support measures to encourage energy efficiency as they did when they were in government prior to 1997.</p><p>We must address climate change. Whether or not we recognise global warming as a threat, the fact is that we continue to pump huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Regardless of whether it is necessary to address it for the long-term future or the immediate future, we must address it as best we can, but given our earlier qualification that we must also encourage adequate supplies of electricity, we must be prepared to address reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in stages. That is where Executive policies seem to miss the boat. They miss many opportunities.</p><p>Biomass has been the poor relation of renewable energy for some time. Systems must be put in place to exploit the large quantities of timber that, as Alasdair Morgan said, are currently unusable. Between 40 and 45 per cent of all cut timber is unusable as wood and is therefore suitable for use as a source of energy. We must have the opportunity to use that. It could be done through combined heat and power systems&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"7730\"/> technology that Scottish and Southern Energy tells me should be encouraged further or the company will not invest in it further&#8212;or it could be done through manipulating the system for renewables obligation certificates to ensure that the production of combined fuel, which Scottish Coal is keen on doing through by-product timber, continues to be an option. Executive policies would appear to have discouraged the development of short-rotation coppicing in Scotland, so it is important to have the opportunity to use our surplus timber, especially when there is so much of it.</p><p>I cannot finish without returning to nuclear power. We heard an excellent speech from John Home Robertson. It was balanced and it contained a view that parallels the view that Conservatives have held for some time. If future electricity generation in Scotland is to be balanced, we must accept that nuclear power has a role. Unless we make decisions today that ensure that our nuclear capacity is replaced as plants are closed down, we will suffer power cuts in the longer term. Those power cuts will not only be inconvenient, they will undermine the economy of Scotland, reduce standards of living and leave us with a shrinking economy.

What he did not address&#8212;we need to address this issue in future&#8212;is the fact that there is population change within Scotland.</p><p>We know that for hundreds of years there has been a drift from rural areas into towns and that, in many ways, that drift continues today. The population drift is more obvious in certain parts of Scotland and perhaps less obvious in areas such as Aberdeen and the north-east, where it is masked by the fact that there is a high rural population. However, the residents are often commuters&#8212;people who use the rural areas as dormitories&#8212;and the people who are born and brought up in the areas still tend to drift away as ever they did.</p><p>The problems that cause that population drift are associated with the lack of housing, the lack of effective transport and&#8212;I suggest&#8212;the lack of appropriate levels of local government funding in certain rural areas. We know perfectly well that <place-holder colnum=\"6063\"/> even in the north-east, where there is a relatively high level of wealth, there have been jobs crises in areas such as Fraserburgh and Peterhead, which are represented by Stewart Stevenson, who is not currently in the chamber.

That is largely as a result of funding problems. Some will argue that small rural schools with composite classes are an inappropriate way of educating young people in their early years. However, the evidence is plain: some of the finest schools in the country, with some of the best results at primary level, are small schools with one, two or perhaps three teachers.</p><p>I will give an example from Angus of the pressure that such schools are under. Angus Council, largely for financial reasons, has had to consider centralising primary school education. Small schools such as St Vigeans Primary School, which has been closed already, the Panmure school, which is currently under threat, and Stracathro Primary School, which has been threatened before and may be threatened again in the near future, are perfect examples of schools in which small numbers of pupils and small numbers of teachers succeed in producing education of a very high quality. Such schools are characterised by the fact that more than half the pupils are there as a result of placing requests. The quality of the education drew the pupils to those schools, because their parents were impressed with the schools' records.</p><p>From what I have heard from councillors, I understand that councils such as Aberdeenshire Council may be forced to take similar action to Angus, simply because of necessary economies.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13311893", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yesterday, the First Minister made a statement in the chamber on population change.

The most effective schemes of this type charge by weight, providing an incentive for householders to produce less waste. The charge would not be punitively high, because according to Professor Jim Baird the cost of household waste collection and disposal in Scotland is currently about &#163;1.50 per household per week.</p><p>Different types of charging scheme are increasingly being introduced throughout Europe and North America.

The McSharry reforms of the 1990s institutionalised and made rigid the system of common agricultural support. As a result, we had a structure that fed specific amounts of money to specific individuals and effectively preserved the rural economy by preserving those who had traditionally been part of it. That performed an important function in its time and, indeed, it has helped us through one of the most difficult periods in farming that Scotland has ever known. However, the mid-term review was essential in that it reversed many of those key rigidities that had been built into the system by McSharry.</p><p>By moving towards a system of decoupling, for the first time we have allowed market forces to become more rather than less significant to the rural economy. Although we are still going through the consultation process, much of that ground has already been made. When we get the proposals for the implementation of the mid-term review, we will be in a position to exploit the new-found freedom in the rural economy.</p><p>The Commission must commit now to looking for ways in which to further institutionalise the return to market economics in rural Scotland in the next programming period. Unless that opportunity is taken, we will be in grave difficulty when it comes to accepting some of the conditions that come along with enlargement. Along with my party, I support enlargement and I believe that it is important that the new countries can compete on that level playing field in Europe for which we have been campaigning for a generation&#8212;although I am concerned that the playing field may not be as level as we would like it to be.</p><p>The structure that institutionalised support in certain areas of Europe has been removed and replaced with one that provides the opportunity to spread support throughout a larger area. However, at the same time, the need to consider production restraint, which is one of the key elements of control of European agricultural production, has been neglected. If we retain the production restraint that exists in certain areas of agricultural production, we will find that we are fighting not on a level playing field, but uphill with one hand tied behind our backs. Efficiencies in eastern Europe will inevitably allow farming communities there to compete more effectively than we can.

In trying to do that over the past four years, we have on occasion found ourselves at odds with bills that were supported either directly or passively by the Scottish Executive. On this occasion it is pleasant, therefore, to come across a bill that appears at the outset to run in the same direction that we would.</p><p>It is interesting that, although the Conservatives are fully supportive of the principles that lie behind the bill&#8212;as was the committee in its report&#8212;we also find that much remains in the bill that will be contested, discussed and possibly amended at later stages. The Conservative party wishes to preserve that constructive attitude during the passage of the bill.</p><p>Let me consider the bill's parts one at a time. On part 1, which deals with biodiversity, I would like to move quickly to thank the minister for the concession that he has already made to introduce a requirement that the Executive must produce a biodiversity strategy. It would seem strange to have all this legislation in place with all its good intentions, if the biodiversity strategy were to be an optional add-on at the end of the day.</p><p>However, we have to be careful about what we do in relation to the biodiversity strategy while we are passing the bill. Although I agree with what Roseanna Cunningham said about how desirable it would have been to have had that strategy in front of us as we considered the bill, I also believe that it is appropriate that the strategy should be dealt with as secondary legislation, which will give us the option to reconsider it from time to time as time goes by. I therefore fully support the procedure that the bill will put in place.</p><p>At the same time, we must take the robust view&#8212;as we should with all legislation&#8212;that the legislation should stand the test of time. There is also an argument that it should stand that blind test of being sound legislation without members' having seen the secondary legislation on the biodiversity strategy. The argument can run both ways.</p><p>I move on to part 2 of the bill. I have concerns about it, but there is much within it that I welcome. The main concern has not been expressed during the debate so far. It is about the role of SNH and how SNH is perceived in areas where sites of special scientific interest are being managed. <place-holder colnum=\"4525\"/></p><p>There is a belief that SNH is a secretive organisation that makes decisions without proper consultation and, in many cases, without proper information. There is a belief that it can take scientific evidence and advice and ignore it without giving any reason whatsoever. For that reason, SNH's reputation has been undermined. Although I will stop well short of suggesting that SNH's powers should be significantly curtailed at this stage, it is important that we take the opportunity presented by the bill to ensure that the future activities of SNH are more transparent and that the organisation is therefore more accountable than it has been in the past.</p><p>The committee's report has something to say on the role of the advisory committee on sites of special scientific interest. Evidence suggests that advice from that important committee has apparently been ignored when SSSIs have been allocated. It is unacceptable that that should happen without the reasons for those decisions being made public. Openness and transparency will reinforce the position of the decisions process.</p><p>The bill also proposes that the Scottish Land Court should take on a dispute resolution role and I welcome that. At the same time, I express a view that was expressed to me by an individual who contacted me in support of the notion of the Land Court taking such a role. He also said that we must do nothing to the Land Court that will undermine the position that that organisation holds. He described the Land Court as an organisation to which anyone could roll up on their bare feet and expect to get a fair hearing. We must not take any action that institutionalises the Land Court to such an extent that it becomes a forum where only those who are able to afford expensive lawyers can get a fair hearing.</p><p>Part 3 of the bill is significant and I and my party are keen to support it. It says quite a bit about poisoning and the control of pesticides. As a farmer who has had experience of controlling pesticides, I am aware that regulations are now run to such a standard that the bill will have no impact on the legitimate use of pesticides in the farming community. Consequently, I support the measures in the bill.</p><p>However, when we consider some of the evidence on snaring, for example, we see the suggestion that alternatives to snaring might be the shooting or gassing of animals. If we accept gassing, we will encourage the introduction into the rural environment of chemicals which have in the past been misused, and might be misused again. Shooting can also be a dangerous practice in certain circumstances. Consequently, the committee has taken the fair view that it must be possible to continue to use snares under controlled circumstances in Scotland. I am <place-holder colnum=\"4526\"/> therefore strongly supportive of the terms in the bill that define how that can be done humanely. I also support the principles that are set out in the committee's report.</p><p>With that, I offer the support of the Conservatives to the bill at stage 1.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308252", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nature Conservation (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we all know, the Conservative party stands up for the interests of the countryside.

Ross Finnie started by setting out, once again, the laudable aims and objectives that he has set out in similar debates in each of the previous four years. He set the scene by saying that the pelagic sector is enjoying a stable existence. Perhaps we have not said enough about the pelagic sector because, when the figures are analysed, it becomes clear that there is no apparent reason for the reduction in the mackerel TAC that is being imposed this year. There are also serious questions&#8212;raised by Richard Lochhead&#8212;about the way in which the TACs for herring are being distributed in the North sea. We deserve some explanation from the minister of the reasoning that may lie behind that.</p><p>Decommissioning was raised repeatedly by members and also by the minister. That issue must be reflected in the allocation of TACs and in the consequential allocation of quotas and days at sea for Scottish boats. As we have said time and again, we cannot be the ones who bear the brunt of the struggle to reduce capacity in the North sea if each year we find that we are no longer credited with the work that has been done in previous years.</p><p>The minister also spoke about the opportunities that are afforded to us by the regional advisory councils. However, as has been said by many in the chamber, the councils are toothless <place-holder colnum=\"4109\"/> organisations. Had they been set up along the lines of the proposals that were contained in the European green paper, they would have been more able to deliver the kind of local management structure that all of us want to see. If that had been done, certain parties might not now be campaigning for the removal of the CFP.</p><p>The minister finished by saying that we had to talk today about partnership and about how the CFP promotes partnership. I understand what he means by that but, unless he can return to the chamber at the end of next week and tell us that the partnership has finally delivered something that meets all our expectations, the days for partnership must now be short indeed.</p><p>Richard Lochhead made a detailed and wide-ranging speech about the regional nature of the cod fishery. Different pieces of evidence were cited in the debate. It is clear, however, that, although cod have become rare in the North sea, they are not a rare fish in the north-east Atlantic area. We have to take seriously the fact that local redistribution might be happening within that area. Before we make rash decisions about how we fish in the North sea, we must have scientific knowledge about that possible local redistribution.</p><p>Robin Harper raised the experience of the Grand banks off the north-east of the United States of America and Canada, where, in a desperate measure to protect cod stocks, fishing was stopped entirely. Unfortunately, although nephrops and other species thrived in that environment, we did not see a recovery of the cod stock. That is why we will always argue that a constructive, positive and interventionist fishery is the right means to correct the balance of stock in the North sea. To simply cut capacity year on year will result in imbalances. Quite often, those imbalances are reflected in peaks in population. We saw that in the 1999 year class of haddock. Again, in my view, that is evidence of imbalance and not recovery.</p><p>The Conservatives want to see the minister succeed. We will vote for the Executive motion. We wish the minister the best of luck and we wish more power to his elbow&#8212;we have done that for the past four years. We also need to see policies return from Europe that contain a degree of vision for the future, for our fishing communities and for how the industry will survive in the long term. If he does not deliver that&#8212;he failed to do so last year&#8212;there is no alternative but to withdraw from the common fisheries policy, take control of the management of our own fisheries and put the measures in place that Europe will not put in place for us.</p>", "hdate": "2003-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13306989", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hope that if I can make some progress, I will come to the point that will answer Mike Rumbles's question.

I should make clear my interest because I have some experience of what SEPA is trying to achieve.</p><p>The Executive's motion is self-congratulatory, but we should not allow ourselves to make that the only criterion for refusing to support it. Although I am proposing a fairly radical amendment, I am happy that we should support the efforts of the Executive and the others who are involved. Many people are working hard to ensure that our bathing waters are improved and that their quality is protected in the long term.</p><p>SEPA inspectors are involved in a project in which they visit farms where agricultural run-off is a possibility. The area in the north-east where I farm managed to escape designation as a nitrate vulnerable zone, but it has been included in the pilot project. I was able to be present when the audit took place. The work that is being done by SEPA inspectors&#8212;like the work that was done when these matters were the responsibility of the predecessor organisation, the North East River Purification Board&#8212;has been constructive and positive. Wherever possible, the inspectors have sought to work hand-in-hand with those who may be creating pollution, to ensure that they understand the regulations and are able to implement them in such a way as to prevent pollution. It is a pleasant departure from the <place-holder colnum=\"4000\"/> policeman mentality that often reigns in Government departments.</p><p>On the broader subject, the European Commission has proposed a replacement for the 1976 bathing water directive. The Conservatives welcome the chance to update the legislation. The Commission proposals include higher water quality standards, but on two, rather than 19, tests that affect public health. That is a more integrated quality management approach and the harmonised methods for handling water samples will also be of benefit.</p><p>The Conservatives in the European Parliament have welcomed the chance to simplify and update the legislation, to make it flexible and to improve the information given to the public about the quality of bathing water throughout Europe. However, Socialist, Liberal and Green amendments that have been passed in the European Parliament would extend the scope of the proposed directive to include waters that are used for other recreational activities, such as surfing and windsurfing. Those activities tend to be undertaken further from the shore over an extended period of time. Designating all those new waters as bathing water sites would significantly increase the extent of monitoring and management.</p><p>Amendments that add new criteria for the chemical composition of water and standards that relate to aquatic life but do not have a direct bearing on public health have also been pushed through. They will add to monitoring costs and could confuse the public who are looking for reassurance about the health and safety of bathing water.</p><p>Of particular importance to Scotland is an amendment that is being lodged by Labour MEPs on behalf of the UK Government. It would allow more flexibility at times of diffuse pollution. The text of the amendment was only partly passed at first reading on 20 November 2003, but the UK will press it in the Council and the Conservatives will support it at second reading.</p><p>The Conservative party knows how important it is for Scotland to have a clean and safe water environment, especially bathing water. It must reach the EU's guidelines to safeguard public health and promote Scotland as an attractive place to visit&#8212;for the sake of our &#163;4.5 billion per annum tourism industry if nothing else. We therefore urge the Executive to take the necessary action to bring the three failing beaches that are included in the report up to the level of mandatory EU standards.</p><p>The Executive must ensure that Scottish Water minimises sewage effluent leakage into rivers, as the effluent eventually runs on to Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"4001\"/> beaches. Cases of that nature attract adverse publicity, as happened in April this year when a sewer in Ayr collapsed and the river was flooded with effluent. Scottish Water has a bad record on leakage, not only from sewers but from water supplies, and compares unfavourably with suppliers in England and Wales. The water industry commissioner has already highlighted the extra cost to Scottish consumers that result from that record. It must be corrected, and we must consider whether we should address the way in which Scottish Water is held accountable. The current arm's-length approach taken by the Executive has resulted in Scottish Water being confused by competing priorities and budgetary constraints.</p><p>It is increasingly clear that planning will be a key issue in the waste disposal issues that the Parliament and the Executive have to address. We should have known that: Scottish Water's applications for much-needed improvements in sewage treatment have continually been knocked back on planning grounds. When we address the planning issue, it is essential that we simplify and speed up the process. With those provisos, I would be pleased, should I be required at the end of the day, to vote for the Executive's motion&#8212;but as others have said, it is a self-congratulatory motion.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-695.1, to leave out from \"commends\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes the continuing improvement in bathing water quality in Scotland but believes that further progress is now dependent on addressing the limitations of Scottish Water and the planning system.\"</p>", "hdate": "2003-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13306848", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bathing Water Quality"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today's debate is one of those in which I ought to take the opportunity to declare an interest, given that agricultural run-off is important to the subject.

However, as many speakers have said, a problem continues with the availability not only of facilities but of people to oversee those facilities in schools.</p><p>It is disappointing that, unlike the days when I was in school, teachers of subjects other than physical education are less willing to support school clubs and teams, to take people around and to give them the opportunity to participate in competitive sport. In previous debates, I have paid tribute to the people who did that when I was at school. We have a problem in identifying the people who will provide such support in our schools today.</p><p>Nevertheless, a large number of clubs could, with the right encouragement, be more involved in encouraging young people to become more active. If the facilities were available, our football clubs and rugby clubs could get people more involved in sport. That is a desperate need, as our rugby team was knocked out of the rugby world cup at an embarrassingly early stage and, to rub salt in the wound, Holland beat us 6-0 in the football.</p><p>If we are to deal with that problem, we need to <place-holder colnum=\"3790\"/> involve people in sport at an early age. It is important to realise that there is a link between the success of our national teams and the willingness of young people to become involved in physical activity, because if our teams were more successful, people might be more willing to get involved in sports, and if they got involved in sports, they might be more able to make our national teams more successful in future.</p><p>In the debate, we have heard some interesting alternative ideas on how we could keep fit. In a very good speech, Duncan McNeil, whom I have always regarded as a more aggressive, bruiser type, gave us an insight into the physical activity in which he was involved when he was a younger man. We also heard from Richard Lochhead, who suggested&#8212;I hope that I get this right, as he is not in the chamber to correct me&#8212;that there might be a link between improved physical activity and increasing the birth rate in Scotland. I will ask him to explain that attitude in greater detail at some point in the future, but perhaps not in the chamber.</p><p>Some serious points were made about the fact that it is more difficult for women&#8212;particularly girls and young women&#8212;to become involved in active sports, especially when they get into their teenage years. Many of the sports in which women choose to get involved are more expensive to support, and the lack of willingness to get involved in them makes it much more difficult for us to get large numbers of young women involved in sport.</p><p>Although the Conservatives accept that much in the Executive motion is worth while and positive, we believe that it fails to see the point. Unless we can catch people young enough and fire their enthusiasm to become involved in physical activity in a way that people were only a generation or two ago, we will be fighting a losing battle when we try to encourage those people to become more active in their later years.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13306244", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Physical Activity: The Need for Improvement and the Cost of Failure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I am being heckled unreasonably.

It would be a joke to say that it was the best one he made today, but he did make two important points that are worth dwelling on. The first one&#8212;and this is where he and I agree, and disagree with others in the chamber&#8212;is that fuel poverty, like absolute poverty, is a moving target and will remain so. We will never be on top of it. However long we go on, fuel poverty will always have to be addressed. The issue might be relatively different from what we have experienced in the past, but it will remain an issue.</p><p>The second issue on which I agree with Tommy Sheridan is that one of the great achievements of this Parliament&#8212;and of the Scottish Executive, of course&#8212;is the central heating programme. The fact that cold homes have existed in Scotland for generations is something that we all understand. The fact that that is unacceptable in this day and age is something that we have all come to understand as well. For that reason, it is extremely important that a programme exists to put central heating into houses.</p><p>However, as many members have pointed out, the programme has not been without its problems. The cause of that was the impact on the marketplace&#8212;in terms of those who were able to do the job and the physical resources that were necessary&#8212;when the programme arrived. It created far too much demand in an economy that was not able to supply it. I have also received many complaints about the quality and delivery of the central heating programme, but I hope that the Executive is now on top of that. I will look for reassurance from the minister that progress has been, and will continue to be, made in the delivery of the central heating programme.<place-holder colnum=\"3533\"/></p><p>It would be remiss of me not to comment on one or two things that a range of members mentioned: the cost of energy and how that impacts on fuel poverty. We must take a broader view of the issue, and not consider it in isolation. There are potential problems with the supply of energy and the associated cost, and if we do not address them at the earliest opportunity, we may suffer from them in the longer term.</p><p>First, the energy white paper that was published at Westminster dodged many of the issues that relate to the generation of cost-effective electricity in Scotland in the longer term. In addition, by making a commitment to 40 per cent of energy from renewable energy sources in Scotland by 2020, the Executive might well have bitten off more than it can chew. We must consider energy policy in Scotland across the board. We must decide how energy will be generated over the next 15 to 17 years and consider the means by which we can generate affordable energy for the future. It is all very well to talk about sustainable electricity generation&#8212;not only do I understand that, I accept and support many of the concepts within it&#8212;but if it results in rising energy prices, we will be fighting a losing battle against the problem of fuel poverty. We must address that at this very early stage.</p><p>We need to take a much broader view of fuel poverty, keep it on our agenda for the longer term and understand that if we cannot generate cost-effective electricity and other energy sources in Scotland, we will be in long-term difficulty.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13305627", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I open by congratulating Tommy Sheridan on the quality of his speech.

That will therefore create a demand that was not there before.

It is a tribute to the members of the Rural Development Committee that so much of what they put in their report has come to fruition.</p><p>The Parliament and the Executive took the whole area of integrated rural development to their hearts at an early stage. The establishment of a cross-cutting Cabinet committee is an example of how seriously the matter is taken. However, we have to be careful about exactly what we mean by integrated rural development and how we apply that to policy across the board.</p><p>We could take a general view and examine the problems associated with the underfunding of health services in some rural areas; I continually get my ear bent by Grampian NHS Board, for example. We could also look at the nature of funding for local government; Aberdeenshire <place-holder colnum=\"2722\"/> Council regularly invites members of the Scottish Parliament from all parties to meetings at which it explains how extremely underfunded it is. I recognise that Aberdeenshire Council and other local authorities find themselves at a disadvantage in terms of funding. However, if a committee is to report on integrated rural development, it must be a little more specific and look at the important areas on which the Minister for Environment and Rural Development and other ministers with joint responsibility have a direct impact.</p><p>I have therefore picked out a cross-section of subjects, much as Roseanna Cunningham did. One subject that she mentioned, and which I would like to raise in the initial moments of my speech, is wind farms. Much has been said about what was in the report&#8212;in fact, I have the recommendations and the Executive response in front of me now. It is no surprise to discover that, all this time after the Government responded negatively to the committee's recommendations on the strategy for wind farms, both my colleague Murdo Fraser and Roseanna Cunningham have lodged motions that clearly reflect the committee's recommendation</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that the Scottish Executive take urgent steps to implement a strategy on the location of renewable energy generation structures in the landscape.\"</p><p>We are all disturbed about the number of letters that we receive on the issue. I have taken the opportunity to visit a number of sites and I can understand why people are concerned. Scotland's landscape is an important part of our attraction to many tourists. Given that tourism is an important resource in Scotland, we must consider the impact that wind farms may have on the attitudes of those who choose to visit rural Scotland. However, as the subject has already been covered, I offer Roseanna Cunningham my full backing. I shall sign her motion when I have the opportunity to do so later today.</p><p>Housing is extensively covered in the report and a number of recommendations are made. I will give my views on the recommendations because I believe that we must not make the mistake of not seeing all the possibilities that exist.</p><p>As Sarah Boyack said, on Tuesday the Environment and Rural Development Committee went to a number of Highland areas to carry out research on our stage 1 report for a forthcoming bill. The people whom we meet when we go on such visits never miss the opportunity to bend our ears on a whole list of subjects. When we visited Braemar, I was taken aside and told clearly about housing problems in the area, which relate to the great interest in tourism there. Many houses that come on to the market end up in the hands of people who want holiday homes.<place-holder colnum=\"2723\"/></p><p>We must address those issues carefully. In places such as Braemar, there is an opportunity for adequate support to be given to enable the private rented sector to deliver in a way that it cannot in other areas.

We must never forget that encouraging ownership of property among all young people is extremely important&#8212;young people should have the opportunity to get a first foot on the housing ladder.

Unfortunately, proposals relating to the many opportunities that have arisen in rural Scotland for disused farm steadings to be used as industrial bases have not been approved by many local authorities. Many small farms are being amalgamated&#8212;we might regret that, but it is inevitable, given current trends in farming. We must ensure that buildings can be utilised.

That should be of some concern.

I sympathise with people who have genuine fears about the safety of proposed equipment.</p><p>Over 1,000 TETRA masts are operational in the UK and I am aware that the emergency services believe the masts to be a vital part of their communication needs. I have spoken to senior police officers in Scotland who have assured me that there are huge safety issues about continuing with the existing system.

Why are some proposed masts to be positioned within towns and residential areas? If it is true that the system is capable of achieving better coverage and will have a longer range, would not it make sense to position the masts on the hilltop sites that were used previously? Councils deal with the masts as a planning matter, so we need answers to that question. We need to know why the masts are being positioned in places that cause concern among local residents instead of on hilltops, where the masts might actually have a better range.</p><p>If the minister has an answer to that question, I will be delighted to hear it.

I remember Rhona Brankin doing the same thing and the current deputy minister, Allan Wilson, defended the industry in his opening speech.</p><p>This is one issue on which I praise the Executive's work over the past four years and into this session of Parliament. The Executive has defended an industry that, at times, was difficult to defend. Four years ago, there were grave doubts about the environmental impact of the industry and calls for an inquiry in the Parliament, but the Executive took a constructive and balanced decision based on the economic importance of the industry to some of the most peripheral areas of Scotland.</p><p>As we have heard, the industry employs 6,500 people, which, when compared to many other industries, is not a lot. Given that the industry is peripheral and exists in areas in which limited employment opportunities must be taken when they come along, the fact that the Executive was willing to balance those considerations against environmental ones was extremely important. As time has progressed, opportunities to begin to deal with the environmental issues have arisen. The strategic framework for aquaculture goes some way towards taking advantage of those opportunities, although it could have done a great deal more.</p><p>We have heard that there are still problems with escapes of salmon and that, although it is claimed that the problem of sea lice is being dealt with, the <place-holder colnum=\"1553\"/> large-scale evidence remains to be seen and the jury is still out on the issue. We have also heard how important it is to cut regulation. Standards are required in the industry, but the burden of regulation under which the industry labours makes it difficult for it to compete on an equal footing with the industry in other countries. The minister must make a commitment to consider regulation in order to determine what can be cut away&#8212;surely much of it can.</p><p>We want more effort to encourage the development of a range of aquaculture activities, including shellfish production. The opportunities in Scotland to raise scallops, mussels and other shellfish have been mentioned. Because shellfish are not dependent on a supply of feed drawn from the sea, they provide huge opportunities.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson and, to a lesser extent, Mark Ruskell spoke about the demand that fish farming creates for industrial fishing. None of us can address that point satisfactorily today, but we must address it. Huge numbers of fish are drawn out of the sea, including not only the feed for haddock and cod, but young haddock and cod, which are taken as a bycatch. That causes enormous problems for all the fisheries.</p><p>Standards are a key issue. We have an opportunity to address the fall in price by selling higher-quality salmon. A high-quality, high-welfare and environmentally sound product can command a premium in the marketplace. We are lucky to have Scottish Quality Salmon, which is in a strong position to continue to market quality salmon with those benefits throughout Europe.</p><p>To answer the question that Jamie Stone posed&#8212;although sadly he is not here to hear the answer&#8212;the Conservative party does not believe in massive state intervention or financial support to make the industry the success that it could be, although we believe that support should be given for market development and promotion.

That is a laudable aim. However, I want to know more about that and to ensure that it does not impact on the supply of electricity and, consequently, the opportunities for industry over that period and into the rest of the century. I want Ross Finnie to answer a question that, when I <place-holder colnum=\"1284\"/> asked it in the Environment and Rural Development Committee this morning, he quickly passed on to Lewis Macdonald, the minister with responsibility. If Mr Finnie could answer my question now or in his winding-up speech, I would be grateful. The question is this: 40 per cent of what? I am interested to know what the Executive's projection is for electricity requirement in Scotland in 2020. We must know what that figure will be to know how we are going to achieve 40 per cent of it from renewable sources and estimate the necessary base load capacity to augment it and give us a stable generating capacity.</p><p>Many renewable sources are, unfortunately, not stable. The figures that we are given often state maximum capacity. I am told that a 100MW wind station is likely, on any given day, to generate between 30MW and 35MW. Consequently, the figures that are being talked about in relation to wind turbine generation capacity are significantly and vastly exaggerated. In tidal, wave and solar power generation there is a level of efficiency far below that which we might expect from base load capacity. We must be sure that we are able to achieve the required level of generation capacity for 2020.</p><p>We also have several significant commitments to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions into the atmosphere. I am perfectly happy to support the principles to which the Government has agreed and to which the Conservatives agreed previously. It is necessary to fight against global warming, and control of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is a key element of the strategy against global warming. However, if we are to guarantee that, in 2020 and beyond, we will be able to produce adequate and affordable levels of electricity to underpin the productivity and growth that are essential in our economy, we must have some indication of the base load capacity of electricity that will be required in Scotland. With the current restrictions, I am in no way confident that that can be achieved without considering nuclear power as a serious option for the future.</p><p>I believe that we must have that debate.

I am concerned that the Executive and the papers that it produces, including the regulations, talk regularly about the imposition of targets. Targets for recycling and other means of waste disposal that move us away from landfill are worth while in the sense that they set an objective that we all feel is necessary. However, my concern is about where targets cause distortion in the system. There are one or two areas where I have concerns about the effects that targets may have.</p><p>We talk about recycling&#8212;particularly composting&#8212;as an alternative to landfill, but I am concerned primarily about the suggestion that, in some cases, incineration be used as an alternative to landfill. Even when power is recovered from the incinerators and some sort of efficiency can be argued, there is a growing concern that public health might be put at risk as a result of a decision to use incineration instead of the landfill option. I would be interested to hear from the minister exactly where the Executive stands on the issue of the incineration of waste and whether any work is being done to allay the public's concerns that are being reported to me, particularly with regard to the disposal of organic waste.</p><p>The issue of landfill is very much to the fore in the area immediately north of Aberdeen. I thought that it would be appropriate to raise one or two concerns that have been raised with me in recent months and years. Other members might want to contribute on this point in greater detail, as it is a constituency interest for them.</p><p>I am particularly concerned about the transportation of waste out of Aberdeen and into the area immediately to the north. The geology of the Aberdeen area means that there is little opportunity to establish landfill sites to the south or west of the city. The area immediately to the north, however, lends itself to the practice of landfill. <place-holder colnum=\"1128\"/></p><p>Consequently, a number of landfill sites have been situated there over the years. In places such as Blackdog, we have seen the way in which landfill should not be done. There are on-going environmental problems associated with that site, which is now closed as it was worked in ways that will damage the environment in the future. There is another controversial site in Wester Hatton, which is still the subject of a number of objections by local people who continue to contact me with their concerns.</p><p>The problem with the regulation of such sites is that the regulations can be so tight&#8212;as with the Wester Hatton site&#8212;that, in many cases, rubbish is not dumped at them. Much of Aberdeen's rubbish goes up the road past the Wester Hatton site and on up to Peterhead, in Stewart Stevenson's constituency, where it is dumped at less cost. As a result of the necessity to move rubbish over longer distances, fuel is burned and the environment is consequently damaged. Is the minister prepared to consider the way in which regulations are implemented to ensure that, in future, we do not have the unfortunate situation in which rubbish is hauled over many miles to avoid problems such as those that have been mentioned?</p><p>Richard Lochhead mentioned the issue of the ships that are coming across the Atlantic and passing through Scottish waters on their way to Teeside. We have to be extremely responsible in our approach to that situation. I have concerns, which many members share. However, if we are to dispose of dangerous substances and recycle waste in a responsible manner, that has to be done somewhere. The techniques and capability to do so might exist in other countries, but they might also exist in the United Kingdom. To the extent that they exist here, it is essential that we accept our responsibility and ensure that such practices are carried out where that can be done most responsibly.</p>", "hdate": "2003-06-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13299522", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Subordinate Legislation: Landfill (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003 (Draft)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Conservatives supported the regulations when they originally passed through committee and will support the amendment regulations today.

It will prohibit anyone other than Scottish Water from providing domestic customers with retail water and sewerage services and will establish a licensing regime to control organisations that provide retail water and sewerage services to non-domestic customers.

The SNP's 2003 election manifesto guaranteed that water will remain under public control and suggested a not-for-profit trust to deliver infrastructure investment and keep charges under control. However, questions asked this morning&#8212;they have not been successfully answered so far, in my view&#8212;would appear to indicate that the model of a not-for-profit trust that the SNP wishes to discuss is not that dissimilar to alternatives that we have proposed, such as mutualisation.</p>", "hdate": "2003-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13298857", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Water Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "What we are discussing today is the fact that the model south of the border has been more successful.

A number of the proposals that have been made could greatly benefit both the Scottish farming industry and the broader rural economy in Scotland. In particular, the proposal for decoupling would give us the opportunity once and for all to return to farming as a business that is carried out on the basis of profit and loss. For economic and environmental reasons, we should no longer be required to support artificial and unnecessary production. By decoupling, we could give our farmers what could be described as freedom to farm.</p><p>However, the discussions that have taken place in the European Parliament and the policies that have been expressed by countries such as France show that some countries obviously oppose any change that would disadvantage their own feather-bedded farmers.

Although the subject can raise a laugh in the Parliament, the protection of the red squirrel in Scotland is a key objective of any wildlife policy. I look forward to proposing such a measure during the passage of the nature conservation bill.</p><p>I will move on to what might be considered rather more serious matters. The proposed water services bill gives the Parliament the opportunity to consider once again the problems that we have with our water industry. Bruce Crawford rightly said that the Conservatives did not propose wholesale privatisation during the election campaign; we once again proposed mutualisation as an alternative structure. We need that alternative structure. Although Scotland has so much clean water&#8212;indeed, it is hard to imagine where it all goes&#8212;it has among the highest water charges in Europe. Bruce Crawford chose to compare those with charges south of the border. Admittedly, the charges here are much higher, but the charges south of the border were achieved under what was perceived in Scotland to be an unpopular and politically incorrect system. We need to examine our system once again and find out whether we can deliver reasonable water charges.</p><p>I remain to be convinced that strategic environmental assessments will be as effective as some people believe they can be.

Indeed, the problems highlighted <place-holder colnum=\"277\"/> today with integrating children with learning difficulties into our schools show what can happen to the public purse when the charges under an uncosted policy begin to mount up. That should teach us all that, if we are to have sustainability, any such measures must be costed. If they are not costed, they are unsustainable.</p><p>The First Minister's statement did not cover concerns about genetically modified organisms. I am perhaps one of the members who is closest to being convinced of the need for GMOs in our environment. However, we need a robust assessment of all the evidence. Moreover, we must complete the testing programme, which&#8212;given the problems that it has faced&#8212;might mean extending it over more years than was originally planned.

If such scrutiny is given, the demands for second chambers and substantial changes to our procedures will fade into insignificance.</p><p>Finally, I will say a few words about the SNP amendment.

It is ironic that, as we debate the points that have been raised today, we hear&#8212;especially from the Labour party, but in a particularly whining tone from the Liberal Democrats&#8212;the notion that everything that has been good in the past six years has been the responsibility of those on the coalition benches, and that everything that has been bad is the legacy of a previous Conservative Government. Anyone who believes that must be naive. We have had a long period during which Labour has either formed the Government or has been a significant part of it, yet it shows no acceptance of the responsibilities that it must face.</p><p>We have heard far too much today about the idea that tax must be increased in order to secure greater expenditure. Gordon Brown has, unfortunately, had to begin to learn the lessons of the mistakes of that policy. We can now only hope that some members in this chamber will learn those lessons. When, as a legacy of the Conservative Government, the total tax take was 39 per cent of gross domestic product, Gordon Brown made great play of the fact that he was paying back the national debt hand over fist. Now that the total tax take is up to almost 42 per cent of GDP, we suddenly find ourselves with one of the largest public sector borrowing requirements that the country has had. Those who blindly follow the tax and spend lead need quickly to learn a lesson from that.</p>", "hdate": "2003-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20158415", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive's Record"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It was entirely appropriate that the Conservative party took the opportunity of the last non-Executive time allocated to us in this Parliament to lodge a motion that put the Executive's record under scrutiny.

Thank you very much, Presiding Officer. I mean that with all my heart.</p><p>At the outset, it is essential that I associate the Conservative party with the remarks that have been made by members of all parties about the welcome return of Winnie Ewing. It is an appropriate day for her to return, because we might be discussing fisheries issues for the last time in this session of Parliament. Such issues exercised Parliament in its formative days four years ago, and have continued to exercise it throughout the four years of its first session. Winnie Ewing has brought her experience to the debate; it must be a matter of regret to her that she has seen brewing throughout her political career the situation that we are discussing.</p><p>It is a matter of enormous regret that we find ourselves in a situation in which the white-fish stocks in the North sea have necessitated a move towards the type of solution that we are considering today. In previous debates, we have often discussed the science that lies behind decisions on fisheries. Although few of us would dispute the science, many of us would dispute the interpretation of that science. However, it is unequivocally and undeniably the case that we must act to deal with the situation that we are in, which is why I must give a reluctant welcome to the fact that the minister has been able to introduce proposals for two schemes that are designed to give transitional support during a difficult period, and to introduce decommissioning to reduce the catching effort all around Scotland, particularly of white fish in the North sea.</p><p>The problem that we have with the schemes is their proportionality, one to the other, which makes it difficult for us to give the Executive the support that it wants at decision time tonight. We have heard from Iain Smith and Rhoda Grant among others, that there is concern throughout the chamber about the balance between the two schemes. To dedicate &#163;40 million to decommissioning and &#163;10 million to the transitional scheme could cause distortion. I welcome the minister's promise that he will include measures to ensure that there will be no movement of effort from white fish to nephrops, but had the scheme been properly balanced in the first place, that would not have been a problem. It is essential that we avoid that displacement, particularly to the small ports about which concern was expressed by people such as John Home Robertson and members from the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson introduced an element to the debate that makes us less able to find the <place-holder colnum=\"18960\"/> unanimity we need today, when he brought us back once again to the old SNP policy of supporting everything that Europe decides to support except where that relates to the fishing industry. As an aside, Stewart Stevenson mentioned one or two countries that he newly wants to compare Scotland to. He praised the Faroes, Iceland and Norway for the way in which they handled their fisheries, but I remind Stewart that none of those countries is a member of the European Union. That is why we welcome members on SNP benches who have been converted to our view that it is high time that Scotland's fisheries were Scotland's responsibility.</p>", "hdate": "2003-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13292664", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Introduction: Subordinate Legislation &#8212; Fishing Vessels (Decommissioning) (Scotland) Scheme 2003 &#8212; Sea Fishing (Transitional Support) (Scotland) (No 2) Scheme 2003"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Six minutes is more than I expected.

Her proposals would genuinely increase the performance of the health service.</p><p>I am prepared to defend issues such as the internal market as an important part of the Conservatives' contribution to the health service. However, the issue that is most often raised with me is GP fundholding. GPs would like to return to that system, if possible. Local health care co-operatives have resulted in the centralisation of power in larger groups and the removal of powers from individual GPs. Malcolm Chisholm would deny that such centralisation has happened, but it has. GPs want that power back and we want to consider policies that will deliver it.</p><p>Mary Scanlon went to great lengths to explain our policy on hospitals, including the establishment of foundation hospitals. What she said is not new, even to the Labour party&#8212;I am talking about Labour party policy south of the border. The potential for improving health provision in Scotland and the Labour party's policy in the south have been ignored in the dogmatic pursuit of what we can only describe as a pre-1979 attitude to health care provision.</p><p>On policy, we heard something from Malcolm Chisholm and we heard a great deal from Mary Scanlon, but we heard absolutely nothing from the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon criticised our policy and Labour's policy, but she did not say what SNP policy was. The SNP was not even prepared to submit an amendment to the motion. It makes the naive assumption that mair tax will inevitably result in better provision and that independence will solve all Scotland's ills, but we cannot accept that naivety any longer.</p>", "hdate": "2003-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13291836", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is nice to see a Tory motion again provoking vociferous debate in the Scottish Parliament.

It is a delight to be able to talk about the Arbroath CAFE project today; I congratulate Andrew Welsh on securing a debate in which we can discuss its achievements.</p><p>Since the CAFE project was established as a charity in 1996, it has been able to respond to and identify some of the needs of young people in the Arbroath area and has provided them with a real alternative to just hanging about on the street, which seems to be the preferred activity of many young people in other areas. The core facility at the drop-in centre is offering leisure, culture, health, education and employment services. It also runs outdoor activities for young people aged between 12 and 25 who are at risk from exclusion, alcohol and substance misuse, and delinquency.</p><p>The dreams and teams project, which is mentioned in the motion, has allowed the CAFE project to become involved in something quite expansive. The CAFE project's involvement with the British Council in Germany has helped it become far more outward looking than was the case previously.</p><p>The street football for all scheme is an interesting concept, and I understand it better now that it has been explained by Andrew Welsh. As he went through the rules of street football for all, Andrew gave me one or two ideas about how we might sort arguments such as those that we heard here this afternoon. If we had introduced those rules on a moderate level here, they might have prevented some of the more outspoken comments that were made today.</p><p>I wish to highlight a number of key points about the CAFE project that I think can be learned from in other areas. Part of the success of the project to date comes from the fact that it does not have a top-down attitude towards its own management. Rather, it actively encourages the youngsters themselves to help manage the project. I pay tribute to the young people who have become involved in the project to that extent.</p><p>The project engages with and has the support of the whole community in the Arbroath area. It originated from the Arbroath and district crime prevention panel's open seminar on juvenile delinquency in July 1996, and has since attracted&#8212;and retained&#8212;the involvement of <place-holder colnum=\"18615\"/> Tayside police, the Arbroath schools, Angus College, local businessmen, Angus Council, Scottish Enterprise Tayside and local health bodies. The involvement of such a cross-section of the community has been key to the project's continued success.</p><p>Although the debate focuses on the CAFE project, I take this opportunity to highlight the excellent work of a number of other youth projects in Angus, some of which I have visited. Andrew Welsh mentioned Oasis and PALS, which are also in Arbroath. I will add the success of Young Montrose and the work done there by Val Cooper. There is also the Zone in Carnoustie, which I understand is now up and running again, although it is still in search of volunteers.</p><p>I pay tribute to all those involved in the CAFE project, especially the many local volunteers who give up so much of their time to ensure that it runs smoothly and successfully. I wish the project every success in the future and have no doubt that it will continue to provide Arbroath and the surrounding area with a service that they are very lucky to have&#8212;a flagship service that I hope will be developed in many other areas of Scotland.

At that stage, views from every corner of the chamber could have been expressed when there was still an opportunity&#8212;to some extent&#8212;to influence the drafting and ultimate implementation of the regulations.</p><p>I am disappointed that the minister seeks to talk about the statutory instruments when we have so much more to talk about in relation to the fishing industry, as we will have in the months and years to come. I am also disappointed, because the fishing industry, above all else, used to bring about consensus in the chamber. We all knew what the problems were and how difficult they were to face, but there was always a willingness to concede and to find consensus across the political divides. Today, we have witnessed the first manifestation of the polarisation of political argument, with the unfortunate results that that has for the fishing industry. We can no longer deliver what we want to deliver.</p><p>I mention in passing that the fishermen have decided to seek direct representation in the chamber, and have formed their own organisation to stand candidates at the Scottish election.

There has got to be a stand against this because this parliament is letting us down badly in all areas.

But the fishing has been let down tremendously badly by this parliament, and the people in the Scottish Parliament, I honestly believe, lack the knowledge about the fishing industry.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, I must criticise Mr Geddes for criticising the Parliament directly; many of the actions at which he expresses dismay are not the Parliament's but the Executive's.</p><p>The Opposition has been consistent in its defence of the fishing industry, but it has become ineffective.

I am prepared to admit that the bill is, by and large, necessary, welcome and long overdue. However, I have grave reservations, for many of the same reasons that John Home Robertson has just expressed.</p><p>We must apply the vital test of whether it is genuinely desirable to continue to run down the amount of land that is available for let. Indeed, Fergus Ewing ably made that point in his opening speech. We know that the amount of land available for let is decreasing, and I do not think that that is desirable. As John Home Robertson pointed out, the availability of new land is necessary if we are to have new entrants to the farming industry. However, we should not make land available through state intervention; after all, the mechanisms that would allow that to happen already exist.</p><p>The legislation threatens and undermines the confidence of people who are willing to let land. People have argued that we are talking simply about the pre-emptive right to purchase land under long-term tenancies. However, if the Parliament decides once to legislate retrospectively on previously existing tenancies, it could do so again. No member of the Parliament can say that it would not or could not. John Home Robertson suggested that if the bill does not succeed in its aims, we should revisit it in the near future. However, that could well be the future that John Home Robertson described in his speech.<place-holder colnum=\"16634\"/></p><p>As I have said, we are seriously undermining the confidence of the people who already let land or who, because of the bill's provisions, own land and are considering whether to let it. Such confidence is necessary to give the boost to the tenanted sector that the bill is capable of delivering.</p><p>In the short time that I have left, I want to make a couple of points that I would have raised if I had been allowed to intervene earlier. Rhoda Grant expressed some extraordinary ideas that were given lip service by one or two other members. It is easy for someone to make comparisons with crofting communities if they have gained their experience in the crofting counties. However, that experience of crofting is not shared by the vast majority of Scotland. Although such comparisons might be relevant in the Highlands, I do not believe that they are relevant across the lowlands of Scotland, where a genuinely competitive market in let land is essential to ensure that those who can farm effectively and efficiently will be able to take on and maintain tenancies when the bill is enacted.</p><p>It must also be said that, when she was listing the advantages of a tenant becoming an owner-occupier, Rhoda Grant missed one enormous point: the millstone of debt. People who become owner-occupiers have to find the money somewhere. Banks will be the main source of that money and at the moment not many banks are willing to get involved in such schemes. Furthermore, those who are able to borrow money to become owner-occupiers will not have the confidence that she suggested they will have, because they will have to manage that debt.</p><p>Presiding Officer, there is much more that could be said about the bill.

I would not like to credit the Executive with having as much as that in its report.</p><p>Murdo Fraser took us on to Conservative policy. We have presented the same strategy on many occasions in such debates. It is about how essential it is to ensure that there is not a predetermined, top-down strategy for culture, because so much of what we call culture comes from the roots. It comes from the bottom up and it is genuinely demand-led by the society that creates it. We must accept that, if we are to see culture in the important role that it serves&#8212;and always has served&#8212;in Scotland.</p><p>On specific issues, I will refer to what Mary Scanlon and John Farquhar Munro said about <place-holder colnum=\"15454\"/> what has happened in the Highlands, where a positive decision has been made to ensure that free music and drama teaching is available in schools. Elaine Murray can correct me in her closing speech if I am wrong, but my understanding is that funding for such activities is included in grant-aided expenditure calculations. Therefore, we should blame for the deficiency not the Executive, but the local authorities that fail to address their responsibility by providing such instruction as part of their normal responsibilities.</p><p>I worry slightly about the proposal for cultural co-ordinators. It reminds me of the political commissars that used to be on Russian submarines. I am sure that that is not what the minister meant, and that that is just one of the conspiracy theories that run around in my mind. Perhaps the money that has been devoted to the scheme would be better spent on providing free music tuition in our schools.</p><p>In certain respects, culture is fragile. Its complexity makes it, at best, delicate. The idea of having a predetermined strategy for culture puts us in danger of trying to hammer in square pegs without first knowing what shape the holes are. In his intervention on Murdo Fraser, the minister said that he did not want to dictate culture; he wanted to facilitate it. That is a radical change from the views that his predecessor expressed last year. I am delighted to hear that there may be some change on that. Culture is evolutionary by its nature. We must never seek to hammer it into any particular box.</p>", "hdate": "2002-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13283397", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Cultural Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has not been one of the most lively that we have had in the Parliament.

The seagull problem has been raised with me many times by constituents and by community councils in the Angus towns of Arbroath and Montrose where the problem is increasing. On a number of occasions I have raised the matter with <place-holder colnum=\"15164\"/> the local authority.</p><p>The local authority has informed me that, in addition to the routine problems, a total of 11 gull attacks were reported to Angus Council in the Montrose area alone in 2001.</p><p>Although the problem is treated as a bit of a joke by those who have not experienced it, the noise, mess and threat of attack from gulls can seriously affect the quality of life of people who live and work in the affected areas.

As has been mentioned, that could damage the vital tourism sector.</p><p>Up until 1995-96, Angus Council provided a free service for the removal of gulls' nests and eggs from buildings in parts of Arbroath.

First, I will do the traditional regional thing and point out that forestry is an important part of the rural economy in the north-east of Scotland. It provides direct employment in tree nurseries and in timber management and production. It is also important indirectly, through associated businesses such as tourism, for example. It is estimated that about 1,330 people are employed in the forestry industry in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire. Although production in the area is currently below 400,000 tonnes a year, that figure, as is the case in the rest of Scotland, is forecast to double over the next 10 years.</p><p>There is real potential for creating jobs in the industry, but one or two things must be addressed&#8212;and are being addressed extensively&#8212;by Aberdeenshire Council and Aberdeen City Council, which have been working together on a review of the joint indicative forestry strategy. It is hoped that the final version of the strategy will be submitted to the Scottish Executive this month. The Executive has possibly received it already.</p><p>Throughout the latter part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, timber planting has resulted in Aberdeenshire's having about 92,000 hectares of woodland, which represents about 14 per cent of the total land area. The forest resource varies from about 18 per cent of the land in Donside and Deeside to less than 7 per cent in Buchan. The two councils' indicative forestry strategy identified Banff and Buchan as being the preferred area for new planting, which has helped to secure Forestry Commission support for the planting of well designed, productive forests.</p><p>The key issue that the forestry industry must address for the north-east, as for the rest of the country, is that of transport. It is extremely important that roads are maintained. In particular, we need links for moving around Aberdeen, and I make no apologies for mentioning Aberdeen's need for a western peripheral bypass.</p><p>There has already been an enormous effort in <place-holder colnum=\"15078\"/> transporting timber by rail&#8212;although perhaps not by sea. Timber has started to be delivered to a railhead at Inverurie recently, which has taken a great deal of timber off the main road south, via Aberdeen. The problem is that taking timber away by rail takes it out of the area for processing elsewhere. We want the timber to be processed in the area. If that means moving timber from the area to the north of Aberdeen, where there is considerable production, to the south of Aberdeen, where there is processing capacity, then it needs to get past the city of Aberdeen. At the moment, the road network is simply not up to that. If the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development could have a word in the ear of the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, I would be most obliged.</p><p>Secondly, the environmental impact and contribution of forestry has been the subject of debate. At this point, I give my full backing to the minister for his support for the red squirrel. It is a bit like the issue of seagulls, which some people do not take very seriously. The demise of the red squirrel is something that none of us would like, and the environment that forests create in the north and north-east is the last bastion in the defence of that species.</p><p>While on the subject of the environment, I would like to apologise for the non-presence of John Scott, our environment spokesman and Transport and the Environment Committee member, at the debate.

I hope that, at tonight's vote, we can at least do what we <place-holder colnum=\"14830\"/> did in those first two years and send our minister off with the hopes, expectations and confidence of members that he will deliver for the Scottish fishing industry.</p><p>We must take account of the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves. Stocks of fish in the North sea fluctuate yearly and are monitored by scientists. The problems that we must address are caused by the interpretation of the scientific evidence. I intend to cover a general point and two specific points on which I would like answers from the minister, either today or subsequently.</p><p>The general point is that too many of the measures that Scottish fishermen have taken to preserve their livelihoods are not being taken into account in the current round of negotiations. We must accept that Scotland's fishermen have already gone beyond many others. The Executive has introduced a decommissioning scheme, which has been taken up, and the fishermen have conformed to the regulations on increased mesh sizes and square-mesh panels. They are considering further measures to protect stocks, such as separation panels.</p><p>Our fishermen have long maintained that the effects of global warming on the North sea and the Atlantic drift, as well as industrial pollution, are behind the fall in cod stocks in the North sea. However, the relationship between predator, competitor and prey is a complex one. The idea that we should close every fishery in which there is even a limited cod bycatch is, at best, naive, as that may result only in greater competition.</p><p>Ultimately, it is the common fisheries policy that has failed. It has failed to conserve fish stocks and it has failed Britain's fishing communities. We must find a way to restore national or local control of our waters, to ensure sensible conservation measures and to protect the interests of Britain's fishermen. That was said yesterday by my colleague Jamie McGrigor, when he replied to the minister's statement. I want to ensure that we understand what that means. We have spoken at great length about the need for zonal and regional management. A year and a half ago, we were delighted with the contents of the European green paper, which appeared to indicate that movement in that direction was possible. Yet, regardless of what we have said on the matter, we now find ourselves with an alternative scenario. It may be that Franz Fischler is simply flying a kite; however, we must not be intimidated by this kite-flying exercise. We must be prepared to put our fishermen first and to work together to ensure that their future is our priority.</p><p>Finally, I turn to the industrial fishery. When this issue was raised at a briefing yesterday, I was fascinated to hear representatives of our Scottish fishing industry saying that they, too, are opposed <place-holder colnum=\"14831\"/> to the continuation of the industrial fishery in the North sea. However, as the Danes and the Swedes are our only allies in our main fishing areas, our fishermen are afraid to complain too loudly about the fishery. I will happily complain for them. Can the minister tell us what all the fish-meal is being used for? As Richard Lochhead said, its use for the feeding of pigs has been banned in this country, under a European directive. Is it simply being poured back into the sea to feed fish? Sadly, that appears to be the case. The industrial fishery must be a target for us in negotiations.

It does not take a genius to work out that, in recent years, we have seen one or two examples of bad agricultural practice and what it can do to the farming industry and the country's economy. That is what we saw during the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. I call good agricultural practice the practice that I indulge in, which is ensuring that I bring as little on to my farm as I can. I do not bring in livestock&#8212;everything is home bred&#8212;and everything that enters the farm as a feed or a fertiliser is properly monitored and assessed. Many such requirements have been introduced by legislation to prevent BSE, but they are examples of good practice and should continue.</p><p>The practice of spreading blood, guts, abattoir waste or untreated or partially treated sewage sludge on agricultural land is, in my view, simply bad agricultural practice. It should not be encouraged, but it appears to be encouraged at the moment by a system that is unwilling to take action to prevent it. I refer to the Executive's failure to act in respect of the problem. We all know that, as environmental regulations are tightened, there are things that need to be disposed of and that we <place-holder colnum=\"14613\"/> must find ways of achieving that. However, I bring to the Executive's attention the traps that we have fallen into in the past. Much of the waste that is being spread on fields, to which George Reid eloquently drew our attention, might also have been dried and used as an animal feed at some time in the past. It takes only a moment of thought to connect what happened when dried and processed waste was used as animal feed and what could, ultimately, happen as a result of the failure to monitor and analyse properly the materials that are being spread on land.</p><p>As a Conservative, I have been accused many times of being in some way responsible for BSE. As a farmer, I still get communications that tell me that I maliciously fed animal waste to my cattle and caused the disease. I understand why people take those views. However, we were all working on the best advice that was available at the time. That advice proved to be wrong, and the consequences became obvious as time went on. My concern is that we are in exactly the same position today and that, unless we secure better advice, better practice and a change in the practice that has been outlined, we may be here in 10 years' time dealing with a similar unforeseen problem.</p><p>I support the broad principle that lies behind what members have said.

From personal experience, my answer is yes. However, identifying racism in such communities is difficult for two reasons. First, the immigrant communities in many rural parts of Scotland are very small indeed, often consisting of a single family. Secondly, families that are so isolated can find themselves far from the kind of back-up services that are necessary.

My research tells me that about one in 10 jobs in the area depends on it. The RRS Discovery and the Verdant Works, both run by Dundee Heritage Trust, are two key components of the area's tourism infrastructure. Last summer, David Davidson and I went to the Verdant Works to see what they have to offer the public. I have with me a fine photograph of him and me playing with the guards outside the main door. I do not think that we looked entirely appropriate, but at least I can claim to have Oor Wullie's haircut.

Downstairs, the museum has machinery that recreates the work that was done there.

It commemorates, through photographs and people's stories, the memory of the people who were alive when the jute industry was important to Dundee. We should remember that that time is at the absolute limit of living memory. When we lose that, the museum will be all that we have left.</p><p>I am aware that the financial crisis that endangers the survival of Dundee Heritage Trust has led to cutting back of staff numbers and the regrettable departure of chief executive Alan Rankin, with whom David Davidson and I held talks when we visited the premises last year.</p><p>That the Dundee and Tayside areas were prepared to support the \"keep Verdant working\" public appeal and to raise the &#163;89,000 that was mentioned is a sign of the level of support for Verdant Works. I take the opportunity to thank <em>The Courier and Advertiser</em> for the work that it did in running that story, which it did for so long.<place-holder colnum=\"13866\"/></p><p>Although I am reassured that Dundee Heritage Trust says that the visiting numbers at RRS Discovery are holding up&#8212;it seems to be on target to reach its 68,000-visitor target&#8212;the fact that visitor numbers at Verdant Works are 35 per cent below target demonstrates the crisis that Verdant Works now faces. It is clear that the museum desperately needs more income than the &#163;27,000 subsidy that it receives from Dundee City Council to allow it to function and, in turn, to allow Dundee Heritage Trust to survive. However, any extra support that Verdant Works needs is likely to be small compared with the &#163;3.5 million that it cost to set the museum up.</p><p>Although I understand that the Executive cannot fund all museums in Scotland, I look forward to hearing from Elaine Murray what positive, practical support the Executive can offer Dundee Heritage Trust&#8212;not least to help it with its marketing&#8212;to ensure the short-term survival of Verdant Works and, in turn, the survival of the RRS Discovery, which is tied to that of Verdant Works.

From the age of eight, I had to get on my bike every morning and cycle the three miles to school. When I got there, an interesting game would be going on in the playground: a perpetual game of three and in. We had one set of goals, which at our school was made not from jerseys but from two particularly well fashioned rubbish bins. That game would sometimes start as early as 8 o'clock in the morning and would continue through the morning break and lunch time.

The girls were not welcome. Thirty years later, however, things had changed to some extent, as my daughter eventually captained the school football team. She was the first girl to have done so and <place-holder colnum=\"12580\"/> she took the team on to some success. I therefore understand the point that was made by some of the lady members because, when my daughter left primary school and went to the secondary school, she was no longer welcome to play football at a genuinely competitive level. The girls were simply not accepted at that level. The resulting resentment that she experienced had a significant impact on her and has perhaps shaped her character to this day. However, the amount of physical activity that took place in schools in those days was largely due to necessity.</p><p>We must also remember the need for role models, to which Dennis Canavan and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton referred.

I hope that the debate is the first step on the long road towards the rejuvenation of the profession in Scotland.</p><p>The social work profession is essential. We have had little opportunity to deal with the detail of the motion, for obvious reasons. However, I want to say that without the social work profession, we would have grave problems across Scotland.</p><p>In the course of my duties as a member of the Scottish Parliament, I often meet people who have problems with their relationship with social workers. Those problems are not about individual contact, but about the lack of individual contact, because the profession cannot cope with the demands that are placed on it.</p><p>I am keen to ensure that we do not end today's debate in the classic position where Labour members accuse Conservative or perhaps SNP members of being more interested in parliamentary procedure than in the people about whom we should be most concerned in relation to the debate. The Conservatives are genuinely concerned about social work in Scotland and the effects of any deficiencies in the profession as a result of training issues. We must remember that the situation in respect of the social care work force is our first priority.</p><p>What happened today was largely a result of management deficiencies. However, the problem is not just about what happened today. There has been some confusion for several days, provoked by the publication of the motion. As business manager in the Conservative group, I found it hard to get a handle on the debate and to decide who in my party should deal with it. Half the Conservative group has been primed to open the debate at various times, including me&#8212;I have the speech here.</p><p>It is important that we do not let the issue pass. I was interested in what Robert Brown said; I, too, would be keen to have another debate on social work at an early opportunity. We might not want to repeat the debate that was planned for today, but <place-holder colnum=\"11064\"/> perhaps we could ensure that we keep to the issues that were to be covered according to the parliamentary agenda. I would be delighted to support in the business bureau any attempt by the Executive to bring forward an early debate to cover those priorities.</p><p>The Conservative party will take no position on the motion.

The change that jumps out at me is that which relates to joint consideration of matters by sub-committees of more than one committee. When I was convener of the Rural Development Committee, Andy Kerr was convener of the Transport and the Environment Committee. As luck would have it, during that period we had to deal with a number of subjects, such as fish farming, that were of equal significance to both committees. We decided that the best way in which to proceed would be to set up a joint sub-committee. However, the lack of a relevant provision in standing orders meant that we had to hold informal discussions. Decisions that were made in the course of those discussions had then to be confirmed by one or other of the committees. Occasionally, that led to strange situations in which, in effect, the two committees met as a joint <place-holder colnum=\"5968\"/> committee. Members of the Rural Development Committee would sit in as guests at meetings of the Transport and the Environment Committee and then switch on a television to see what members of the Transport and the Environment Committee had said after they left. Giving committees the power to delegate business to sub-committees meeting jointly will have a genuine impact in such circumstances, should they arise. They will arise when we least expect them to.</p><p>I am delighted to say that the Conservatives will support the changes that are proposed in the motion.

Like other members who represent the North of Scotland Water Authority area, I have received many complaints from businesses and individuals about the rise in charges over the past four years.

Although the charges are bad in the rest of Scotland&#8212;where the average is &#163;295&#8212;they are particularly bad in the north of Scotland.

Brian Adam's experiences are similar to mine, in that he had contact with travelling people in rural parts of the north-east when he was young. I have seen how children from the travelling communities who arrived in a rural primary school were bullied and isolated and how teachers chose to deal with the problem. For that reason, the report is something of a surprise. When I was at school 30 years ago, I was told not to use the word \"Gypsy\". However, coming back to the subject through reading the report, I have been taught to do something differently from the way I was taught before. As Brian Adam said, we were encouraged to refer to the community as the travelling people at that time. That is how they are still in my mind.</p><p>Kenny Gibson said that we need a broader view of Gypsy Travellers as people who have made a lifestyle choice rather than as an ethnic minority. Michael McMahon then expressed the opposite <place-holder colnum=\"4508\"/> view. He made the point, when Kenny Gibson intervened, that Gypsy Travellers are an ethnic minority and that the report deals with them as such and does not include the many other parts of the travelling community that exist in Scotland and have traditionally descended from migrant labourers and other groups. If that is the case, and if we are to consider only the Gypsy Travellers to whom this report refers and exclude other groups such as new age travellers and migrant labourers&#8212;who can come into the argument when it concerns the use made of facilities&#8212;surely Michael McMahon's argument is divisive and non-inclusive.

It is becoming increasingly obvious that his speeches to the Parliament have become works of art in their own right&#8212;today's speech must be commended. If he is writing his speeches himself, he is one of Scotland's premier authors. If not, he might wish to inform us later who is doing so.</p><p>While I will be disagreeing with the motion, I have to agree with one or two things that the minister said. He said that Scotland's culture is vigorous and diverse and that description could not be more accurate. Scotland is as culturally diverse as it is geographically diverse. For that reason, we must be careful about how we interpret culture and how we apply the principles that are contained in the document. In common with other members, I have not had time to read it.</p><p>Because Scotland is so diverse, it is essential that we think about how we support culture across the country as a whole. Where Governments seek to take a lead with a strategy document it is clear that the strategy will be coloured by the views of the Executive or Government that supported it in the first place. That is why the Conservatives believe that culture should always be a bottom-up event rather than a top-down one. There is always the danger that the strategy is used to reverse that.</p><p>I agree with a criticism made by Mike Russell, that the strategy is too concerned with management and micro-management. The analogy that I would make is that in the strategy we cannot see the wood for the trees. Because of the detailed nature of the way that it covers certain issues, it is essential for us to understand that the strategy is so focused and targeted that it might miss unknown cultural diversity that is waiting to explode in a new area of Scotland. That said, I should repeat that I have not read it all.</p><p>I am trying to be brief, but the minister might like to consider one further issue. It was covered, to a limited extent, in a reply that the minister gave to a question earlier today. I want to raise the issue of the place of broadcasting and its underpinning of culture across large areas of Scotland where <place-holder colnum=\"3410\"/> populations are rather more sparse and the opportunity to mix and generate new aspects of culture can be more limited.</p><p>There are those who may be trying to spread scare stories about the ability of Scottish broadcasters to continue to foster local issues and priorities. Many of those stories focus on news and current affairs. We should never forget that broadcasting plays a key role in the support of culture. Should local broadcasting be threatened, local culture is in its own way threatened. As I said earlier, I believe that those scare stories have been spread unjustifiably.

It covers a number of issues that require to be addressed. However, farmers who have received a summary of the document have complained to me that not enough farmers were involved in its preparation. That is a warning for the future, which can be applied to the implementation of the strategy. Although I fully acknowledge the importance of top-level contacts with the NFUS, the Scottish Crofters Union and the Scottish Landowners Federation, the Executive must in future be fully aware that the farming industry cannot be treated in the same way as others have been. Individual farmers' views must continue to be sought whenever possible during the implementation of the strategy.</p><p>I suspect that the Executive continues to confuse agriculture with farming. It fails to realise that agriculture is a science, but that farming is still very much a business. The research and education base for agriculture in Scotland is being eroded. I admit that the minister made an important concession in his speech, but the Executive's failure to underpin the science base in agriculture has produced a generation that is voting with its feet and seeking education or training that may lead to more financially rewarding employment than that afforded by the farming industry.</p><p>There are those who believe that the proposals in the document do not go far enough. However, Conservative members understand that the Executive walks a fine line, deviation from which could result in catastrophe for the industry in one way or another. First, we could be led towards a future in which farming is done by a few enormous farming companies that are able to push efficiency to the limit, resulting in an industry more like that in the American midwest or parts of Australia. Alternatively, we could end up as a nation of small farmers and crofters whose incomes are determined entirely by the level of state subsidy to which they are entitled&#8212;a prospect that is already alienating the next generation of farmers, who see no dignity in a life as Ross Finnie's retainer.</p><p>The future of the rural economy must be based on a model that retains the existing patchwork of independent businesses, some small and some large. Some businesses would be exclusively involved in the primary industry of farming, some would be involved in processing farm produce and some would exist to serve the farming industry.</p><p>In our traditional farming areas, such as the <place-holder colnum=\"3046\"/> Howe of the Mearns, where I come from, there is a mix of small farms and family farms that are run by the self-employed and larger farms that can provide paid employment. The message that the Executive gives out today must be that both groups of farms are of equal value and are equally deserving of support.</p><p>I understand from Fergus Ewing's speech that at yesterday's Rural Development Committee attempts were made to suggest that support must be targeted at small farmers and crofters. At best, that approach is naive and, at worst, it is an appeal for political support. Above all, it is misguided, as not only would it undermine the jobs of those who are employed on larger farms, but it could have a further knock-on effect. In the past, we have called for a level playing field in Europe; indeed, we will continue to do so. If the proposed targeting were applied on a pan-European basis, it might well end up as an argument for the removal of support from Scotland, where the farms are larger, in order to concentrate support on countries such as Greece or Italy or perhaps some of the applicant countries.</p><p>I will introduce two further points that are not covered in the strategy.</p>", "hdate": "2001-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13258306", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Time for Reflection: \"A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by drawing members' attention to my entry in the register of members' interests.

We saw our fishermen forced to the wall and farm incomes collapse and we addressed the foot-and-mouth outbreak. However, during those two years, we spent most time on the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>I firmly believe that the committee report is a well-researched and balanced view of the issues raised by the bill. The evidence on the need to control foxes was overwhelming. The committee spent some time on the economic justification for hunting and members should be aware that there are two distinct aspects to that issue. Jobs lost and economic activity curtailed as a direct result of ending mounted fox hunting are of concern, obviously, but in paragraph 39 we stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"as long as individual circumstances are taken into account when the detail of this Bill is considered, these economic factors alone are not enough to justify <place-holder colnum=\"2574\"/> unnecessary suffering.\"</p><p>We must consider the economic impact of fox predation on our hard-pressed rural industries. Foxes take lambs. While I do not keep lambs, as an arable farmer in a valley bottom I have planted seed in the springtime and ploughed up my neighbour's lambs, which foxes had carried, dead, from the hills and buried on my ploughed land. The idea that foxes do not kill lambs&#8212;apparently, they wait for them to die of natural causes&#8212;is ridiculous. Next, I will be hearing that that they are vegetarian.</p><p>The impact of foxes on game birds is also a serious problem for gamekeepers and sporting estates throughout Scotland. In truth, the means of dealing with the fox problem are limited. I have acted as a referee for applicants for shotguns and firearms certificates. How many of the members who support shooting as an alternative will be prepared to commit themselves to do that to ensure that there are adequate numbers of guns available?</p><p>Lamping&#8212;shooting at night&#8212;works only on suitable terrain. Do we therefore poison foxes or gas them or snare them? No. The most important of the committee's findings is that the use of dogs is not the common factor in cruelty to wild animals. On the contrary, we found that using hounds on the hills or terriers underground or even using lurchers to back up the stray shot that only wounds a running fox are more humane than many of the alternatives. The bill's proposer has told us that he intends to introduce amendments to remove some of those practices. What would that leave in? I believe that the bill's sole aim is to ban men in red coats from riding to hounds.

Unfortunately, as a result of pressure of work, we did not arrive at a point when we could begin that process, so we were delighted when the European Committee took up the issue at an opportune moment and proceeded to produce its report.</p><p>The report is significant, not only because it mirrors the views that were expressed by the Rural Development Committee&#8212;we have discussed the report and backed it 100 per cent&#8212;but because it was prepared while John Home Robertson, the former fisheries minister, was on the committee. His contribution was important and his experience was of great benefit. Most significant, however, is the title of the report&#8212;\"Reforming the Common Fisheries Policy: a Blueprint for negotiations\"&#8212;because it is a blueprint for negotiations. We have all heard that the common fisheries policy has damaged the fishing industry, and that damage shows most clearly in Scotland, because&#8212;as we have heard&#8212;Scotland's fishing industry is significant in our most peripheral areas. It has long been the will of every political group in this Parliament to reform the common fisheries policy.</p><p>It is increasingly the case that we also support the need to devolve the management of our fisheries stocks to the lowest possible level, so that ultimately we gain proper local control. As is clear from the report, we have gathered round the view that the correct level for that management is one that includes all the countries that have an interest in a given fishery. That is why the principle of zonal management has become established and embedded in the report, as the declared will and desire of everyone in this Parliament. We need the Executive to take up that view and go forward with it. I have no doubt that the minister agrees broadly with the principles of the report, but I urge her to take on board its details and to express that view in international negotiations.</p><p>That brings me to the most important and significant point, which has been repeated several times during the debate&#8212;the fishing industry is far more important to Scotland than it is to the rest of <place-holder colnum=\"1672\"/> the United Kingdom, or to virtually any other country in Europe. It is therefore essential that Scotland's ministers are in a position to represent Scotland's interests. For that reason, I urge the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development to take every possible opportunity to ensure that, when negotiations take place, she and her colleague the Minister for Environment and Rural Development are at the forefront. Only then will Scotland's interests be represented above all else.</p><p>It is my pleasure to commend the European Committee's report to Parliament. When we come to a unanimous conclusion at the end of today's debate, I hope that what is set out in the report's pages is the true future for the Scottish fishing industry, so that we can go forward hand in hand, Parliament and Executive, to begin to impose Scotland's will and Scotland's needs on the common fisheries policy.</p>", "hdate": "2001-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13254770", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "May I be the first to congratulate Stewart Stevenson on his maiden speech in Parliament.

The report has taken some considerable time in the committee's busy schedule but the subject is important.</p><p>The committee first met less than two years ago. Our priority at that first meeting was to identify issues to which the committee should devote its time over the ensuing four years. Obviously, there were priorities concerning farming, fishing, forestry and other traditionally rural matters that had been dealt with by committees at Westminster. However, it was obvious to the committee that the new rural affairs concept&#8212;which this Parliament sought to launch&#8212;was a priority that had to be addressed.</p><p>At this stage I must pay tribute to one or two people who were important to the report. I would like to single out two former members of the committee who were integral to pushing the rural affairs agenda and getting the inquiry up and running&#8212;Cathy Peattie and Irene McGugan. They pushed the priority of rural affairs at an early stage and made us realise that there was more to it than the farming and fishing priorities of the past.</p><p>I also take the opportunity to thank for their input many of the professionals and advisers on whom the committee relied for the success of the inquiry and subsequent report. From the Scottish Parliament information centre, I highlight the efforts of Simon Wakefield, who was particularly active in controlling the direction of the report. I also convey our thanks to Sue Sadler, who organised many of the public meetings. I particularly thank Professor Mark Shucksmith, who was the adviser to the research project. He helped to steer us through some of the more difficult areas and was integral to the drafting of the report.</p><p>I will go over what the committee did to consult the public of Scotland on how we should report on the subjects that we chose. After considerable discussion and consultation with our adviser&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"353\"/> once he was in place&#8212;we decided to investigate the impact of changing employment patterns in rural Scotland. That crystallised and defined more clearly the views that were originally expressed on the first day on which the committee met.</p><p>To that end, the inquiry was launched on 30 March 2000. The overall aim of the inquiry was to undertake a wide-ranging investigation into the major changes taking place in rural Scotland, the impact of those changes on rural communities&#8212;particularly on poverty and housing&#8212;and the effectiveness of current policy responses. The inquiry also aimed to contribute to understanding how joined-up government can be made to work for Scotland's rural communities.</p><p>The objectives of the inquiry were to identify the key drivers of change in employment patterns, to identify who gains and who loses as a result of those changing employment patterns, to assess the impact of the changes and to review the current policy to support employment in rural Scotland. We also wished to identify best practice and areas for improvement in policy, as well as to report on the inquiry and make recommendations for action to address likely further changes.</p><p>The consultation process on which we embarked relied on a number of methods. A series of seven local consultation meetings was organised. Those meetings took place throughout Scotland to enable members of the committee to hear views from local people regarding their experiences of changing employment patterns, the impact of those changes and the policy actions that they felt would be effective. Five of the meetings were open to the public and two were by invitation only. The research team worked in partnership with local organisations to set up the public meetings, invite local people to participate and promote each meeting widely in the locality.</p><p>At this point, I should say that we subsequently received representations that the publicity was not as effective in some cases as it may have been. One of the lessons that we learned during the inquiry was that, just as we know what is going on, we believe that people on the ground ought to know what is going on. It is disappointing that many who felt that they had something to contribute were unable to do so simply because they were not aware that the meetings were taking place. I advise committees to examine more closely the publicity attached to public meetings that the Parliament or its committees hold in future.</p><p>The public meetings took place in Newtown St Boswells, Stornoway, Newton Stewart, Laurencekirk and Dingwall. There was also a meeting that was designed to cover Argyll and Bute, which was eventually carried out by means of a video link. That meeting afforded us the first <place-holder colnum=\"354\"/> opportunity to exploit that technology and we advise others to use it to contact other areas of Scotland.</p><p>Local authorities and local enterprise companies were involved in each public meeting. They were invited to make presentations to MSPs and members of the public. Those presentations covered the employment changes experienced in the area and set the scene for the discussion that followed.</p><p>Through the meetings, 246 people were able to make their views known to the researchers. At the same time, a consultation document was mailed to more than 400 individuals and organisations with an interest in rural Scotland. That document was also placed on the Scottish Parliament website and more than 350 accesses to it were made. Press releases were sent to national and local media to alert the general public to the consultation. Responses were invited, to be in by 18 May last year. That succeeded in eliciting 100 written responses from a wide range of organisations and individuals.</p><p>What information did we glean from the consultation process? The key findings of the report are that rural employment is in decline in most sectors and that transport&#8212;especially the cost of transport in rural Scotland&#8212;is by far the biggest concern of those who expressed opinions at the public meetings and through the consultation.</p><p>We also found that poverty in rural areas is distinct, in that it is highly dispersed and often disguised within a more wealthy community. It is also most common among older people. The key causes of poverty are lower wages, low uptake of benefits, the higher cost of child care and the lack of affordable housing.</p><p>Although rural Scotland's economy is different from that of urban Scotland, it is very diverse. Demand for the service sector is growing in rural Scotland as traditional manufacturing and agriculture decline. The Rural Development Committee is concerned that the combination of poverty and declining traditional industries is threatening the sustainability of rural life in certain areas.</p><p>I want to touch on the Executive's reaction to the report. There was some disappointment among members of the committee, who felt that the reaction was rather hostile. I want to take as constructive an attitude as possible. When it established the inquiry and subsequently drafted the report, the committee's aim was to benefit the future work of the committee and the Parliament, and, we hoped, stimulate reaction from the Executive&#8212;which we certainly did. If the report was interpreted as an attack on Executive policy, I <place-holder colnum=\"355\"/> can only offer my apologies to the minister, because that was never the intention. By making constructive progress and by addressing the issues that we have identified as priorities for the Parliament, the committee can proceed hand-in-hand with the Executive&#8212;whoever may form it in future&#8212;to work on longer-term policy, up to and beyond the horizon of the current political climate.</p>", "hdate": "2001-05-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13251090", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Scotland (Employment Patterns)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is my pleasure to be able to present the report on behalf of the Rural Development Committee.

My heart goes out to those who will be affected by the proposal. As a livestock farmer, I feel the effects of such a proposal. However, it has my full and unreserved support, as have previous proposals that the minister has made. We need to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease before it spreads further across Scotland.</p><p>I have one or two concerns relating to the statement and additional to it, which I would like to raise. If the minister could address them now, that would be helpful. However, if he is unable to address them now and would prefer to do so later, I would be pleased to receive his responses on that basis.</p><p>First, a number of farmers are concerned that farmers who did not purchase stock but were present at Longtown market when the infection became rife may have transferred the infection back to their stock. I would be grateful if the minister could tell us whether any effort is being made to monitor the health of stock on farms belonging to farmers and others who were present at Longtown market but did not buy sheep on that day.</p><p>Secondly, I have received representations regarding the resources that are available for <place-holder colnum=\"622\"/> carrying out the slaughter programme. The proposal to kill up to 200,000 extra sheep will require a great many additional resources, especially in manpower. Can the minister reassure me that the manpower will be made available to carry out that slaughter in the short term, and that there will continue to be a speedy delivery of service, where necessary, for the destruction of flocks and other herds that have been identified as having the disease? People are concerned about the time lag between first identification of the disease and the final disposal of some herds.</p><p>Concern has also been expressed by farmers in the north and north-east that the licensing scheme that the minister implemented some weeks ago, for which we are very grateful, is being used to move livestock through potentially infected areas to abattoirs in the north and north-east. Although those animals are being killed in those abattoirs, there is grave concern that stock is being moved north. I wonder whether the minister's division along the Forth and the Clyde will apply to stock being transferred directly to abattoirs in the north and the north-east.</p><p>I must qualify the next point that I want to raise by saying that it is, in some respects, speculative. I hope that no one who is listening today assumes that my point indicates the existence of a problem. South of the border, there is a suggestion that the process of the disposal of infected stock will no longer necessarily take place on the farm in which the infection has been detected. The suggestion is that the animals may be transported to a rendering plant after they have been slaughtered and that that will be done in sealed lorries. Is that policy likely to be adopted within the context of the outbreak in the south of Scotland? Will the minister give a guarantee that no infected stock that has been slaughtered south of the border will be brought to Scottish plants for rendering?</p><p>My final point is relatively less serious, but is equally concerning to some farmers in a specific areas. The infection has now reached the top of the Clyde. The fishing season opens around now&#8212;I believe that the trout fishing season opens tomorrow. A number of farmers in that area expressed concern to me on the phone before I came to the chamber that anglers might spread the infection on the banks of the Clyde. I have mentioned that previously to the minister and continue to have concerns about the activities of anglers. I would be interested to know whether the minister has any further statement on that or any recommendations to make to people who want to take advantage of the opportunity to fish in Scotland's rivers.</p>", "hdate": "2001-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13248008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Foot-and-mouth Disease"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for the advance copy of his statement and I identify with the remarks that were made by the minister and Fergus Ewing.

At the risk of sounding repetitive, I would like to open my remarks by drawing members' attention to my entry in the register of members' interests, which shows that I am a farmer. I should also say that I am a livestock farmer. I am a member of the National Farmers Union of Scotland and of the Scottish Landowners Federation. Those two organisations have made a number of statements on the issue that we are about to discuss.</p><p>The heading that we have chosen for the motion today is crisis in the countryside. In the past, that expression has often been used as something of a political statement with which to attack the Executive. However, I think that we all agree that we are talking today about a genuine crisis in rural Scotland.</p><p>In addressing the subject of foot-and-mouth-disease, I would like to take the opportunity to register my admiration and praise not only for the Minister for Rural Development, but for all those in his department who are working to control the disease. There has been a call&#8212;justifiable, perhaps&#8212;for more information and quicker response times from members of his department, but I hope that we all agree that appropriate actions are being taken to control the disease and I hope that all members support those actions. The Conservative party continues to offer its support.</p><p>I will single out one area to reinforce further my support for the minister's position: the maintenance of the slaughter policy as the mainstay of our methods of controlling foot-and-mouth disease. There were many calls in the papers at the weekend for consideration of vaccination as an alternative to slaughter for controlling the disease. I will defend the slaughter policy on a number of grounds.</p><p>We must remember not only that Scotland has <place-holder colnum=\"338\"/> farm animals that are susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, but that it has a substantial number of wild animals that are equally susceptible. Scotland's deer population would be affected seriously were we to allow foot-and-mouth disease to become endemic. To move towards a vaccination policy would be to accept that the disease will become endemic in the long term. There are sound welfare reasons for the maintenance of the slaughter policy.</p><p>However, the main reason that I choose to defend the policy is that we must ensure that Scotland remains free to export wherever it can find a market for its quality products with premium values. As an exporting country that has difficulty in achieving profitability on its farms merely because of commodity prices, we must pursue premium prices in the marketplace. Scotland is, perhaps, a world leader in finding ways to achieve such premium prices. Our farmers have various marketing schemes that are designed to achieve that, and we have a growing organic sector, which is also trying to pursue such higher prices in the marketplace.</p><p>To achieve those premium prices, we must have access to a European market and a world market, so that we can corner the top slice of the market wherever we go. If we accept a vaccination policy instead of a slaughter policy, we also deny ourselves that future opportunity. It is therefore essential that the minister and his equivalent at Westminster retain their commitment to the slaughter policy as the mainstay of our methods to control foot-and-mouth disease.</p><p>At the weekend, I was disappointed that one or two organisations took the opportunity to make their way into the press to object to factory farming on the ground that it continues to be the cause of many of the problems in the farming industry. The idea that foot-and-mouth disease is somehow caused by the intensive agriculture that goes on in the United Kingdom is the biggest red herring that I have been sold for a long time, perhaps even bigger than the one that I was sold a moment ago. We have one of the most efficient farming industries anywhere in the world, but it is far from factory farming; our agriculture is far from industrial.</p><p>However, those who might be most likely to be accused of such practices are the farmers in Scotland who have been able to keep their animals most free of disease&#8212;I refer to our pig industry. I know many people, especially in the north and north-east, who are involved in the pig industry. They are able to guarantee the quality of their product in a way that many others might not be able to do. It is largely for that reason that the pig industry in the north-east was the first to take advantage of the minister's licensing scheme to <place-holder colnum=\"339\"/> return its product to the marketplace.</p><p>I would like to raise a point with the minister about the licensing scheme, which I hope he will be able to address today. I was delighted that he introduced a scheme that allows strictly licensed movement of livestock directly to abattoirs. However, I and many other members of the Parliament have, in the past few days, received numerous phone calls from farmers who need to move animals to places other than abattoirs. For that reason, I ask the minister whether he will consider maintaining the licence scheme, but extending it to include&#8212;strictly for welfare reasons&#8212;the movement of livestock to places other than abattoirs.</p>", "hdate": "2001-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13247112", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crisis in Rural Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you very much, Presiding Officer.

That is not the case today, but I will reinforce the theme that he chose to follow.</p><p>The report that the Rural Development Committee published this week contained a genuine reflection of what we found when we travelled around rural Scotland. Our inquiry was carried out over 10 months and the report reflects the feelings of many of the people whom we met and spoke to.</p><p>Like Fergus Ewing, I will take the theme of what does not appear in the programme for government document. When I looked through the section that is devoted to rural development, I found that, although many of the projects that the Minister for Rural Development pursued over the year were mentioned, there was no reference to beef exports, for example. Nowhere does the document <place-holder colnum=\"843\"/> mention the \"great success\" of the date-based export scheme. Hailed as a triumph at the outset, the scheme has been a total failure and seems to have fallen off the list of successes. Although the BSE crisis in Europe makes this a difficult time, farmers want and expect the Executive to pursue the issue of beef exports, yet it is not mentioned in the list of promises.</p><p>The Executive also fails to mention the implementation of the new less-favoured areas scheme, which threatens the very future of our crofters and marginal hill farmers. Jim Walker, the president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"By year 3 of the Scheme, as it currently stands, the majority of LFA farms across Scotland face having their incomes drastically and unfairly cut\".</p><p>Similarly, the president of the Scottish Crofters Union, Donnie MacLennan, said that the Scottish Executive had, with its deal on the new scheme, \"abandoned\" crofters. The renegotiation of that disastrous scheme must be among the Executive's top priorities. Scotland's hill farmers and crofters expect nothing less.</p><p>In the document, the Executive says quite clearly that it intends</p><p class=\"indent\">\"To support a high quality science base in agricultural, biological and related sciences which delivers research of strategic relevance\".</p><p>However, the reality is, as has been made clear over the past 10 days, that the Scottish Executive is cutting funding to the Scottish Agricultural College by &#163;1.5 million in real terms over the next three years. The SAC says that those cuts will jeopardise key research programmes, at a time when public concern about food safety and animal health has never been greater.</p><p>The chairman of the SAC, Maitland Mackie, who is a prominent member of the Minister for Rural Development's party, stated publicly that the Scottish Executive does not share the view of the Scottish farming industry that the SAC is essential to the survival of the rural and agricultural sector. Fears are growing that the highly educated Scottish farming industry will no longer have the support of that valuable institution, which is well known throughout the world.</p><p>Another aspect of the underfunding of the SAC hits home in many rural areas in Scotland&#8212;I take as my example the proposed closure of the veterinary laboratory in Thurso, which covers a huge geographical area in the Highlands and Islands and is responsible for 300,000 cattle, 1.1 million sheep and 5,200 agricultural holdings. It carries out key surveillance and research and its scientific achievements, which include research into enzootic ewe abortion, scrapie and bovine viral diarrhoea, are known worldwide. The threat to <place-holder colnum=\"844\"/> the laboratory will undermine Scotland's agriculture.

The first thing that she said was that she was glad that the debate is taking place. Since it is a debate in Conservative time, I am delighted to back her on that.</p><p>We have spoken in the past about where the Parliament fits into the structure and activities of the Executive. In the minds of some, it is questionable whether the debate should have taken place while negotiations are on-going in Europe. It is essential that the Parliament takes the opportunity to express its views at a time when there is still a chance to influence thinking and to contribute to the debate.</p><p>I was delighted to hear the minister explain what happened to the cod recovery plan and previous proposals, and to hear her say that there was no intention of accepting the original plan that was discussed on 19 December. Our fishermen were quick to let us know that they had no intention of approving anything in that proposal.<place-holder colnum=\"341\"/></p><p>I am therefore delighted to hear that further negotiation is taking place. I am also pleased to hear that a two-tier plan is being developed. It is essential that the cod is protected in the short term, but also that it is protected in the long term, and I welcome the plan for a cod recovery plan with a five-year structure.</p><p>Recovery in cod alone is not enough for our industry, however. We have heard about the importance of reducing the capacity of the fleet. It is essential that, as the cod stocks recover in the North sea, the fishing industry is scaled to be appropriate to that recovery. For that reason, we must look ahead, in tune with that five-year plan, to find ways to ensure that, at the end of those five years, our industry is in the perfect position&#8212;in terms of size, capacity and the type of boats that it contains&#8212;to match its catch to the productivity of the sea.</p><p>We must work together&#8212;not through the kind of argument that we have heard so far today&#8212;to get a decommissioning scheme in place. The benefits of a decommissioning scheme are obvious, but I shall run through one or two of them. Such a scheme would give us the opportunity to tune the industry to the catch and to ensure that, at the end of the five years, the boats are the most modern, the safest and the best suited to the continuation of a successful industry. To achieve that, we need money. To get that money, we must be prepared to work together. European money is available, but, as we have heard before, the extent of European support for any decommissioning scheme will be limited&#8212;as are any match funding schemes from Europe&#8212;by the agreement that was entered into at Fontainebleau many years ago. I raise that subject specifically because I know that it will be cited to us, whether I raise it or not.</p><p>I shall close by saying something about the Fontainebleau arrangements. As a result of the Fontainebleau agreement, the additional cost of any scheme will represent only 21 per cent of the total cost, whereas 50:50 funding would be the order of the day were we not party to that agreement. I also remind members that the benefits that we have received from the Fontainebleau agreement&#8212;which the current Government continues to receive as a result of that agreement&#8212;exceed that funding by a massive proportion. It is therefore inappropriate for the Fontainebleau agreement to be used as an excuse for failure adequately to fund partly European-funded schemes that require UK money to attract that funding.</p><p>I urge the minister to make efforts, as part of a longer-term strategy, to ensure that UK money is available to attract the additional European money that may be available to match that funding, to get <place-holder colnum=\"342\"/> the recovery plan and the decommissioning scheme going hand in hand.</p>", "hdate": "2001-01-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13242869", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is always a pleasure to be able to support, from the Conservative benches, what the fisheries minister says.

That is why today the Conservatives will support the motion in the name of Ross Finnie. I hope that the SNP will also be able to support that motion when we come to vote on it this evening. The SNP's amendment is a step too far, as it attempts to tie the hands of the minister and to drive a wedge into the unanimous support that is undoubtedly required before the minister leaves for the council meeting.</p><p>I am sure that, when the Minister for Rural Development winds up, he will be able to defend the Executive's record against Richard Lochhead's attacks. However, it is probably my responsibility to deal with the attacks that were made on the Conservative party and its policy, and I propose to do so.</p><p>The question is fairly simple: where do the Tories stand in the debate about the future devolution of fisheries management? In the UK in particular, the widespread feeling is that Brussels bureaucrats have been running the common fisheries policy for far too long. Everyone recognises that fishermen and scientists who live and work in specific fishing zones should be involved in the management of fisheries.</p><p>Conservatives believe in the continuation of the common fisheries policy, but that policy must work on behalf of those in Scotland whose livelihood depends on it. The preferred option would be to devolve fisheries management away from Brussels to national, local or, above all, zonal management structures. Many in the chamber and in the fishing industry favour the nomination of zones across international boundaries, embracing countries where the waters have been fished for centuries, as one way in which that devolution could be achieved. Such areas would include the North sea, the western approaches, the Bay of Biscay, the west of Scotland and the Irish sea. <place-holder colnum=\"742\"/></p><p>Management committees in each zone would take decisions on total allowable catches, quotas, discards, subsidies, technical conservation measures and enforcement. The European Commission would chair and provide the secretariat for those communities and would continue to act as an international referee. I will not read out our whole manifesto for the benefit of Richard Lochhead, but I hope that I have clarified the Conservative party's position.</p><p>I again urge the SNP to take the opportunity to join the rest of the chamber in sending the Deputy Minister for Rural Development to the negotiations that will take place in the December round of the fisheries council with the unanimous backing and encouragement of all members in the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2000-12-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13240377", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sea Fisheries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At the start of the debate, I was surprised to hear how many members congratulated the new Deputy Minister for Rural Development, who is responsible for fisheries, on her first speech on deep sea fisheries.

If Jack McConnell wants to claim that Labour has lifted the beef ban, he should go and organise some exports for us&#8212;if he possibly can.</p><p>My final point relates to an issue raised by Sylvia Jackson on the implementation of European directives, specifically the waste water directive. There is a current issue in Dundee, where the <place-holder colnum=\"520\"/> Christian Salvesen vegetable processing plant looks likely to close, with the loss of many jobs in the area. That is due entirely to the way in which the waste water directive has been implemented. That will have massive knock-on effects, particularly on pea and bean production, which is a common activity in Angus and south Kincardine. It is likely that businesses producing up to &#163;3 million for the local economy will be lost.

On that day, it was explained that this was likely to be a largely uncontroversial bill, and that it was important to the future of the <place-holder colnum=\"362\"/> salmon fisheries in Scotland. Since then, it has come to pass that there are controversial aspects to this bill, one or two of which have been raised today. At our meeting of 19 September, the Rural Affairs Committee gave a commitment to treat this bill as an emergency and deal with it in the shortest time scale possible.</p><p>It is a matter of some concern, in regard to this bill and previous bills that the Rural Affairs Committee has dealt with, that a relatively short time was available for consultation. We hope that by taking advantage of the extensive consultation that was carried out by the Scottish Executive rural affairs department, and by having a secondary written consultation, which allowed consultees to contribute their views on the bill as introduced, we have had a full and detailed consultation. However, the short time scale will inevitably lead to certain individuals' feeling that their opportunity to be consulted was not as it could have been. I hope that they will be satisfied with the way in which the bill is handled by the Rural Affairs Committee and SERAD in future.</p><p>We have heard in great detail the concern that the bill does not cover a wide enough range of the important aspects of Scottish salmon production relating to declining salmon numbers. We have to accept that this bill is simply the start of a process. In her opening remarks the Deputy Minister for Rural Development acknowledged that. However, the problem of the marine phase of the salmon fishery and what happens to fisheries on the high seas obviously is excluded from the bill, and needs to be addressed in the longer term.</p><p>On the issue of predators, which has been raised by a number of people, Fergus Ewing made the relevant point that, under the proposed section 10A(3)(b), there would be the opportunity for Scottish ministers to take up the Scottish Fishermen's Federation's proposal to establish a seal commission. I would be interested to hear the minister's views on Fergus's suggestion. I throw my weight behind the SFF's proposal that a seal commission should be considered to deal with this difficult problem.</p><p>We have heard the salmon farming industry being blamed for one or two of the problems facing wild salmon. I share John Home Robertson's view that we must not make the mistake of tarring the salmon farming industry with the same brush that has been widely used by certain people in Scotland. The salmon farming industry is a vital industry, especially in the peripheral areas where it exists. While it is not a major industry in terms of employment across Scotland as a whole, it is crucial in its own backyard. Any minister who failed to take into account its importance as an economic lifeline would be failing in their duty. I commend John <place-holder colnum=\"363\"/> Home Robertson for the positive attitude that he has taken on this matter in the past.</p><p>I am grateful for the minister's reassurance that the structure of the bill means that it is possible to time-limit regulations. I support Jamie McGrigor's suggestion that the time limit should be set at three years. It is important to remember that going through the consultation process on a three-year basis provides an important opportunity to adjust and modify regulations so that they are current and practical. For the same reason, I find it difficult to accept the concept of blanket regulation across the whole of Scotland. While I would be happy to hear arguments on that from the minister today, and possibly at stage 2, it is of grave concern that regulations that are relevant only to specific areas may be imposed across the whole of Scotland, thereby damaging other areas.</p><p>I also take the opportunity to support those who have called today for special consideration for the position of netsmen. We have heard much about the salmon netsmen in the south-west of Scotland. I offer an assurance that I have been approached by similarly vociferous netsmen from the north-east of Scotland. They are worried that the bill may damage their long-standing traditional fishery.</p><p>I know from my experience in the coastal areas of Kincardineshire that there is a great tradition among small farmers of finding work with the salmon nets to displace their low-income problems. The farming community is back in a period of low incomes but, unfortunately, the salmon netting industry cannot provide that employment.</p><p>As Conservative spokesman, it is my pleasure&#8212;I suppose&#8212;to welcome the bill. I am glad that we have highlighted in the debate the fact that the bill will be not the end but the start of a process that must continue into the future to protect the salmon in all its range, not only in the rivers.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13239274", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Salmon Conservation (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is nothing in my entry in the \"Register of Members' Interests\" to which I should draw Parliament's attention.

On my journeys from Stonehaven to Edinburgh during the first few days of the Parliament, I noticed a building to the north of Arbroath. It was quite an attractive building, sitting on top of a small mound. I was surprised to discover later that it was St Vigeans Primary School. The school was brought to my attention by people in the Arbroath area when it was suggested that the school might be closed.</p><p>A report that was published on 25 April goes into detail on the quality of the education provided at St Vigeans. The report is positive about the school: two categories are judged to be very good, 13 are judged to be good, five are judged to be fair and none are judged to be unsatisfactory. The report points out that the school's toilets are a poor feature. However, the parents have been saying that for years, and have been asking the council to upgrade them. There has been no capital expenditure on the school for eight years.</p><p>On 25 April, the education committee of the SNP-controlled Angus Council instructed the council's director of education to undertake preliminary consultation with staff and parents on the possibility of closing St Vigeans in June 2001. On 6 June, the education committee received the education director's report, recommending a statutory consultation exercise on closure. The committee accepted that, and the formal consultation process ran to 31 August.</p><p>The St Vigeans parents challenged a number of the education director's key points in the report. The report suggested that all gym activities take place in the local hall when, in fact, in suitable weather conditions physical education takes place in the field adjoining the school.<place-holder colnum=\"489\"/></p><p>As recently as 1997, parents were quoted &#163;40,000 to &#163;50,000 as the sum estimated as being required for upgrading. The council now suggests that &#163;250,000 would be the minimum amount. The parents refute that figure and have their own fully costed plans, which would cost some &#163;70,000. They also point out that the council's figure of &#163;250,000 includes improvements that are not needed. The replacement of windows and doors, for example, would cost &#163;25,000, yet the existing ones seem perfectly adequate.</p><p>The report fails to point out that of the 33 Angus primary schools with fewer than 85 pupils, St Vigeans, with a cost per pupil per annum of &#163;2,261 in 1998-99, is the most efficient.</p><p>The report says that there are problems of sound transmission between the classrooms, but that has never been raised by pupils, parents or teachers.</p><p>The report goes on to say that it is difficult to argue that St Vigeans Primary School is a focal point for community life in this area.

The school is in a unique setting with rural characteristics. It takes part in village life, it has links with the village church and it uses the village hall for a gym.

The parents choose to bring their children to the school because of its quality.</p><p>The chairman of the council's education committee, Brian Milne, has consistently suggested that this closure is not motivated by financial considerations. He tells us that it is motivated by the fact that the school is below the quality that is expected. However, the quality of the school building is partly due to the fact that it has received no investment over the past eight years; in that time, the council has failed to upgrade adequately the accommodation. Now Mr Milne argues that the school must close, but suggests that that is not for financial reasons.</p><p>The parents are especially concerned that their children will have to move from this small rural school into large primary schools in the Arbroath area. That, above all, is the concern that motivates the views that have been expressed to me. Many people in this room will have experienced the problems of moving from a village school to an important secondary school in a county town.

It happened to be the same Wednesday that the voting and microphone system failed in Parliament. We had hoped to start at half-past 6, but it was nearly 7 o'clock by the time we eventually did.

If I sound negative during my speech, it is largely because, as a farmer, I like to have a good moan sometimes.</p><p>However, I begin by being positive and declaring my support for the document. I took the opportunity to welcome it during the discussion after Mr Finnie introduced it to Parliament and I continue to welcome it today. However, I wish to explain my concerns about the broad strategy it introduces. First, I am slightly concerned about its title. It is not so much a forward strategy for Scottish agriculture as a search for a forward strategy. At the same time, it is not so much a discussion document as a questionnaire. If we look through it, that is what it is full of: questions.</p><p>I am concerned that the document led to criticism from the National Farmers Union this week. A press release from the NFU says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We continue to seek fair competition but so far neither 3 years of a new Westminster administration or 1 year of a Scottish Parliament have actually tackled these tough issues head on.\"</p><p>I made a public statement about how that criticism was addressed. My concern is that the NFU chose to criticise the Scottish Parliament. I would far rather it had criticised the Scottish Executive. The concerns of the NFU appear to have brought disrepute on the whole Parliament rather than on those whom I may choose, for political reasons, to blame for the problems farmers face. There has been consultation after consultation. I can understand the disappointment that the NFU chose to express.</p><p>I wish to highlight the problem we face with the hill livestock compensatory allowance&#8212;John <place-holder colnum=\"975\"/> Munro and one or two others have mentioned it. I am sure that the suggestion that we change from a headage-based system to an area-based one has sound reasons in the structures of Europe, but the damage that it may have on the structure of the farming industry in Scotland is quite extraordinary.</p><p>I live in the margin between the Lowlands and the Highlands. While I, as a dairy farmer, am not affected by the HLCA, many of my neighbours are. They tend to be smaller farmers who, although they farm marginal land, farm it intensively. They have come to depend on support, not least the HLCA.</p><p>There are, I believe, a large number of farmers who are in a critical position. If the change is carried out in such a way that a headage payment becomes an area payment, a huge number of marginal farmers in Scotland will find themselves in an impossible economic position almost overnight. That is why I urge the minister to take the opportunity to reinforce further the view that I know he has expressed, in conjunction with others in the Parliament, that that change cannot be carried out overnight.</p><p>In supporting the principle that lies behind the document, I can assure the minister that not only will the Conservative group support the Conservative amendment today, but we will support the minister's motion, when that opportunity comes along.</p><p>I am mildly concerned about the nature of the Scottish National Party's amendment. The principles that lie behind the problems of Scottish agriculture require a degree of unity. I am particularly disappointed to find that the SNP's amendment contains, once again, the independence clause. It would have been a great pleasure for the Conservative group&#8212;and for me&#8212;to be able to vote for the SNP's amendment, but it is disappointing to discover that by supporting it we would be supporting independence.</p><p>In the interests of the farming industry, I invite the SNP to take the opportunity to decide not to put in such a clause next time and to show the farmers of Scotland a united Scottish Parliament whose members are willing to work together to fulfil farmers' desires&#8212;and their interests in the longer term&#8212;without allowing simple party politics to get in the way.</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13232483", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agriculture Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In declaring an interest, I would also like to make a small apology to the minister.

The experience that I had this morning in encountering one or two problems as I tried to get here, which made me wonder whether I would be able to make this speech, has brought my mind into focus. The problems that I am likely to face tomorrow when three members of the Rural Affairs Committee and I visit Islay, after which I may have an eight-hour journey home, may focus my mind further.</p><p>This debate is being held as committee business. It is a tribute to the processes of the Parliament that we have managed to secure a debate on the Borders rail link. A few moments ago, while John McAllion was speaking, I made a note about the importance of the role that is played by the Public Petitions Committee, whose function is to put petitions into the committee system and to encourage discussion such as the one at the meeting of the Rural Affairs Committee that led to this debate. We have to acknowledge the success of the petitions system.</p><p>The petition on the Borders rail campaign was placed not with the Rural Affairs Committee, but with the Transport and the Environment Committee, which asked for comments from the Rural Affairs Committee. We discussed the issue at great length at our meeting on 2 May. It was the unanimous view of the committee that the issues raised in the petition were worthy of support. It was also the view of the committee that, as convener, I should write on behalf of all members of the committee to request that the petition's call for time to be given for a debate in Parliament be considered at the earliest opportunity. That is why <place-holder colnum=\"1217\"/> I, not the convener of the Transport and the Environment Committee, am introducing today's debate.</p><p>It must be acknowledged that, when it was announced that the debate was to take place today, 1 June, there was some dismay among the leading campaigners within and outside the Parliament, who felt that the debate was happening too early in the process. However, I hope that today's debate will focus the views of the Parliament and that we will be able to consider the issue in committee and in the chamber in future once further progress has been made and there are further issues to discuss.</p><p>We recognise that discussion of the project requires specialist knowledge. The committee is extremely grateful for the advice of Christine Grahame, Euan Robson and Ian Jenkins, who, at various stages, have attended committee meetings to assist us in our discussions and in the process of deciding how we want to progress the matter.</p><p>The issue is important within the context of a number of the campaigns and investigations being sponsored by the Rural Affairs Committee. In recent months, we have been gathering information and views for our investigation into changing employment patterns in rural Scotland. The issue of transport in rural areas has been raised time and again, which has gone a long way towards persuading all members of the committee that the Parliament should focus on the issue of constructing a railway through the Borders between Edinburgh and Carlisle.</p><p>The motion is an attempt to reconcile a range of views and to gain the support of the whole Parliament. It deliberately steers away from committing the Executive to any specific action that could result in concerns over the budget. At the same time, it points to a practical way in which to proceed at this stage and allows the whole Parliament to commit its support to the Borders rail campaign. I hope that everyone in the Parliament feels that the motion is worthy of support.</p><p>We recognise that the project may proceed in a number of stages and that, although some methods of funding may be easier to achieve than others, the project may go ahead with a range of funding sources. We hope that the motion does not commit the Parliament to any particular funding route.</p><p>On behalf of the Rural Affairs Committee, it is my pleasure to move motion S1M-922, in my name.

It is appropriate that I should take this opportunity to indicate that the committee will, once again, devote its time and energy to meeting the required time scale for the second stage.

We firmly believe that the economic and social development mentioned in paragraph (d) and the enhancement of cultural heritage mentioned in paragraph (a) have a great deal in common. However, the concept of zoning introduced by the Transport and the Environment Committee offers an appropriate vehicle for the adoption of differing emphases on those aims according to the requirements of an area.</p><p>Another concern that was raised by the Rural Affairs Committee and is shared by the Conservative group is about the way in which the bill has been introduced as an overarching piece of legislation so that individual parks will be set up through subordinate legislation. As a result, with regard to individual designation orders, the power of the Parliament may be limited to annulment of the order. We urge the minister to consider how that concern might be addressed. Some members believe&#8212;Linda Fabiani has expressed this eloquently&#8212;that the Parliament should have a means whereby it could contribute to the individual designation of national parks.</p><p>Conservative members also share the concerns that have been expressed over representation on park authorities. Given the aim that is set out in section 1(3)(d), which I have praised so highly, it is in my view essential that we ensure that membership of the national park authority adequately represents those who live and work within the area of the national park. While I believe that schedule 1 makes a valiant effort to ensure broad representation, it must be noted that, as became obvious during the evidence-gathering sessions conducted by the Rural Affairs Committee, the demand for places in the national park authority, which we have already heard will not exceed 20, might be such that local authorities will be unwilling to give up any of their 50 per cent allocation in order to ensure genuine local representation.</p><p>As for the other 50 per cent of the places, I already have a long list of representative interests that I feel should be included among those considered by the Scottish ministers&#8212;I am sure <place-holder colnum=\"1003\"/> that Sarah Boyack has a substantial list as well. I dare say that, in these days of consensual politics, her list and mine might even overlap. Unfortunately, that still gives no guarantee that local people who live and work in the park area will be represented on the park authority. I urge the minister to consider that and to clarify this matter.</p><p>It may have come as a surprise to those who have read the Rural Affairs Committee report quite how much of it&#8212;almost three pages&#8212;is devoted to marine national parks, especially as section 29 of the bill extends to only three lines. That reflects the concern that marine parks, which were not mentioned in the draft bill, may have been an afterthought and may not have been subject to proper and appropriate consultation.</p><p>Although, for sound reasons, the Conservatives support the inclusion of section 29, I believe that, in light of the report, further clarification is needed on those questions that are raised but not answered by the inclusion of the section. I urge the minister to consider section 29 again in the light of comments in the report.</p><p>Conservative members also have concerns over issues raised by planning and the cost of maintaining the park.

We have heard how important rural schools are and that small rural schools are not necessarily bad rural schools. I have referred before to my experience and that of my children, who went to a small rural school and received a quality education there in composite classes, sometimes in difficult surroundings. It is the quality of our schools that is important.</p><p>The issues surrounding rural school closures were highlighted when we discussed Boharm Primary School. The example that I would like to bring to members' attention today is slightly different. St Vigeans Primary School is on the outskirts of Arbroath. For what I believe are primarily financial reasons, there has been a proposal to close it. It has a roll of 42 pupils. In the past, it was classed as having a capacity of up to 50 pupils, but because of the required pupil:teacher ratio, 42 is the maximum it can take.</p><p>Until recently, St Vigeans was classified as a rural school, but for a reason that I have yet to understand, boundaries have been moved and the school is now in the Arbroath area. Of the 42 pupils, only 14 live within the catchment area. The parents of the other 28 have chosen to bring their children in. It is a glowing tribute to a tiny school that operates with two composite classes that it can attract pupils who live a considerable distance away. I visited the school last night and spoke to a number of parents, including one couple who regularly make a 22-mile round trip to deliver or collect their children.</p><p>Despite all that, there is pressure to close the school. We have to remember that quantity is not always the best thing for education, and that children who come from a rural background are often far better suited to attending a rural school than they are to being bundled into major schools in the county towns. We have to keep that at the front of our minds.</p><p>Another reason for mentioning St Vigeans is that it is in an area controlled by a SNP council. Peter Peacock and I have had our discussions: I <place-holder colnum=\"424\"/> suggested that the Executive is the cause of the problem; he suggested that it was the good old Tories. I would like to suggest that perhaps we are all partially responsible for the situation.

It is appropriate that I should bring that fact to the Parliament's attention, given that it is always important for members of the committee to be allowed to have their views on particular issues. It was important that those views were taken into account during the preparation of our report.</p><p>The motion is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament notes the terms of the report by the Rural Affairs Committee, The impact of the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 (SP paper 42), in particular its dissatisfaction and concern about the level of consultation carried out prior to the introduction of the boundaries order, that the introduction of a boundaries order appears not to have identified any inconsistency with the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987, and that the amount of fishing activity in the disputed area does not appear to have influenced the Order, and further notes the Committee's recommendation that the Secretary of State for Scotland should either introduce a new, revised Order, or support a Bill calling for a revised boundary proposed in the House of Commons by Archy Kirkwood MP.\"</p><p>This issue goes back some time and, as I am sure members will all remember, we debated it at some length on 3 June last year. That day, members eventually approved a motion amended, if I remember correctly, by Euan Robson. It was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament notes that &#8212; the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order (S.I.1999/1126) in no way alters or restricts the freedom of the Scottish fleet to fish consistently with the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union; from 1 July the Parliament will be charged with the responsibility of regulating fishing in the newly created Scottish zone of British Fishery Limits and fishing by all Scottish vessels no matter where they fish; consultation will be required with relevant bodies in the preparation of legislation relating to fishing in the Scottish zone and the Scottish fishing organisations have considerable concerns about the said Order; and calls upon the relevant Minister to (a) meet representatives of the <place-holder colnum=\"11\"/> Scottish fishing industry to discuss their concern and in particular their desire to re-establish the custom and practice of former years in regard to the east coast boundary and (b) convey such concerns to the Secretary of State for Scotland.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/1999-06-03.258.2\">[<i>Official Report</i>, 3 June 1999; Vol 1, c 258.]</citation></p><p>On 5 October 1999, the Rural Affairs Committee considered a letter from the Scottish Executive rural affairs department which explained the outcome of those consultations. In the light of that letter, the committee took evidence on 2 November 1999 from Hamish Morrison of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs, John Home Robertson, on their reaction to the consultation.</p><p>On 9 November, the position was set out in a written answer received by Richard Lochhead, a member of the Rural Affairs Committee. The question that he asked was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has made representations on behalf of the fishing industry to Her Majesty's Government in relation to the Scottish Waters Adjacent Boundary Order 1999 and, if so, when they were made, to whom, and whether any response has been received.\"</p><p>The answer he received from John Home Robertson was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I have, as promised in the debate, written to the Minister of the Crown on these matters.

It does not seek to reiterate all the arguments that were put forward in the debate on 3 June last year, but follows up the key outstanding issues that were raised then. The committee takes seriously the disappointment that the Scottish Fishermen's Federation continues to express. It has been argued that a resolution of this problem&#8212;or even a decision that is more widely accepted&#8212;could help to restore confidence among the fishing community. The persistent concerns of the fishing industry that the committee accepts should be addressed are the level of consultation that was carried out prior to the introduction of the boundaries order and the scope for confusion that was created by the choice of boundary that was made.</p><p>The committee heard evidence about the implementation of the consultative process prior to the introduction of the order. The chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, Hamish Morrison, said that in his view:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There was no consultation before the event, nor was there any explanation after it. Fishermen and their representatives, myself included, discovered entirely by accident that this measure had been enacted.\"<place-holder colnum=\"12\"/></p><p>Mr Home Robertson, the minister responsible for fisheries, referred to a press release issued on 8 March 1999 announcing the proposed boundary prior to its consideration in the House of Commons.

In particular, the committee is concerned by two matters that may have resulted from lack of consultation. First, when the boundary order was introduced, no inconsistency with the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987 appears to have been identified. Secondly, the amount of fishing activity in the disputed area does not appear to have influenced the order. That became clear during evidence taking on 2 November, when Irene McGugan asked:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Were records checked, to determine who fished mostly in the disputed area&#8212;whether Scottish or English vessels?\"</p><p>The minister replied:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We lack information on that. There has been light policing of that territory, and there is precious little evidence of boardings or sightings of vessels from any country in that area. We do not have detailed information on that.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Rural Affairs Committee</i>, 2 November 1999; c 195.]</p><p>The Scottish Fishermen's Federation subsequently provided information that it had received from the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency on 3 June 1999, showing boardings and sightings of Scottish vessels between April 1996 and March 1999 in the vicinity of the median line. It is the committee's opinion that, had that information been available earlier, it might have influenced the discussion on the order.</p><p>One issue that we decided to include in the report was the scope for confusion created by the order. In his evidence, the minister sought to steer debate away from the sensational comment about winning or losing specific amounts of sea area and explained that this is a new boundary where there has been no boundary previously. The committee accepts the need for a definition of Scottish and <place-holder colnum=\"13\"/> English areas of the North sea for fishing purposes, on the basis that the operational patrolling limit of the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency had no legal significance. That patrolling boundary has been quoted as the boundary of custom and repute.</p><p>Reference has already been made to the existence of another boundary between Scottish and English waters, which was established by the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987 for the purposes of the Continental Shelf Act 1964. Within the territorial waters&#8212;up to the 12-mile limit&#8212;the two boundaries are close but are separated by a distance of 0.09 km. That means that, out to the 12-mile limit, there is an area&#8212;not exactly a gap&#8212;in which the boundaries do not agree.</p><p>That brings me to my next point. I mentioned the scope for confusion. The area between the boundaries has not only confused the issue, but confused the committee. Examples of that were highlighted during the preparation of the report, such as the problem of Scottish boats operating between the two boundaries being under Scots law if they are undertaking oil contract work and under English law if they are fishing in the disputed zone. To emphasise that confusion, the report gets those two positions the wrong way round. I ask the minister to acknowledge that correction.</p><p>John Home Robertson argued that the potential for confusion over oil-related work was hypothetical. He advised that there are three decommissioned oil installations in the area, which have been cleared as safe for normal commercial fishing, and that two further oil installations will be disposed of in the same way. The committee believes that the existence of two different boundaries between Scottish and English waters in the North sea could lead to confusion, as I have explained.</p><p>On what solution might be recommended, some members of the committee felt that we should not follow the same course as the House of Commons committee, which considered the matter by seeking to define a boundary line without adequate consultation. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation has pointed out that the newly adopted median line runs straight through the Berwick bank fishing ground and it has warned of the possibility of fishing regulations being varied, at some point in the future, across the Scottish/English boundary in that vicinity. The minister has assured the committee that the present Administration would not seek to make any regulations that differ from those that exist on the other side of the boundary, but the possibility remains that, with the devolution of fisheries powers, we may in future create different regimes on either side of that boundary.<place-holder colnum=\"14\"/></p><p>On the balance of evidence that it has received, the committee has decided that a fishing boundary through the Berwick bank fishing ground is inappropriate, and recommends that the line that is defined by the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987 be adopted for the purpose of defining adjacent waters and the Scottish fishing zone.</p><p>The Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 has other potential impacts. There has been some confusion and misunderstanding. One of the principal arguments for taking no action on the fishermen's concerns was that the imposition of the boundary would pose no advantage or disadvantage to fishermen. It was generally understood that fishermen were the only people who would be affected. In the debate in Parliament on 3 June, the Minister for Rural Affairs&#8212;Ross Finnie&#8212;said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the fact is that the order relates only to fisheries.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/1999-06-03.227.15\">[<i>Official Report</i>, 3 June 1999; Vol 1, c 228.]</citation></p><p>However, in the House of Commons Third Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, on 23 March 1999, the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution&#8212;Mr McLeish&#8212;said that:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The boundary, however, does have potential significance in relation to other matters that are devolved, notably within the UK territorial sea.\"</p><p>He also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The boundary that is specified in this draft order does not automatically apply to such functions\".&#8212;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>, <i>Third Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation</i>, 23 March 1999; c 5.]</p><p>The committee has subsequently examined the full implications of the order in more detail and is now of the opinion that, contrary to the previous understanding, the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 may have consequences for other legislation, beyond that affecting fishing. The order contains two distinct definitions of boundaries. Article 3 sets the boundaries for internal waters and the territorial sea; article 4 sets the boundaries for the sea within the British fisheries limits.</p><p>Section 126 of the Scotland Act 1998 interprets the word \"Scotland\" as including so much of the internal waters and territorial sea of the United Kingdom as is adjacent to Scotland. The boundaries of Scotland are therefore partly set by this order, which means that other legislation relying upon that definition of Scotland&#8212;such as the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985&#8212;might already be affected by the boundary.</p><p>The new advice raises matters that are outwith the responsibility of the Rural Affairs Committee but which might be of interest to Parliament. Furthermore, it highlights the fact that, as the <place-holder colnum=\"15\"/> impact of the order might not be confined to the fishing industry, a decision on whether the matter should be re-examined should not depend only on the question of advantage or disadvantage to fishermen.</p><p>Although the committee accepted that the resolution of this issue is reserved to the UK Parliament, it was united in wishing to make known its dissatisfaction with the present situation. As for how to overcome the problem, the committee recommends that the Secretary of State for Scotland introduce a new, revised order that adopts a line defined by the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987 for the purposes of defining both the adjacent waters and the Scottish fisheries zone. The committee also noted that it is open to the Government to support a bill calling for a revised boundary that will be proposed in the House of Commons by Archy Kirkwood.</p><p>That is an explanation&#8212;in reasonable time&#8212;of why the committee came to its decision. All of its concerns have been included in the motion before Parliament; I commend the motion to the chamber.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the terms of the report by the Rural Affairs Committee, The Impact of the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 (SP paper 42), in particular its dissatisfaction and concern about the level of consultation carried out prior to the introduction of the boundaries order, that the introduction of a boundaries order appears not to have identified any inconsistency with the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987, and that the amount of fishing activity in the disputed area does not appear to have influenced the Order, and further notes the Committee's recommendation that the Secretary of State for Scotland should either introduce a new, revised Order, or support a Bill calling for a revised boundary proposed in the House of Commons by Archy Kirkwood MP.</p>", "hdate": "2000-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13226101", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The minister acknowledged that he \"would have liked much more proactive consultation about the designation of the new boundary when it happened\".&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs Committee, 2 November 1999; c 197.] The committee accepts that the processes leading up to devolution may have affected the preparation and the publication of the order.

The first asked the Parliament to debate the issue of GM foods. The second asked us to support the call to have GM foods banned in Scotland. It is with great pleasure that I welcome today's debate, which satisfies the demand of the first petition, which the Rural Affairs Committee approved. We did not approve the second petition, but decided to wait to make a judgment, pending a debate on the issue. I am therefore delighted to be able to take part in today's debate.</p><p>Genetically modified food has, as we have heard, been a controversial issue for many years. It is widely available in Scotland and, surprisingly to some people, is in cheese products and, I believe, in some tomato products. However, the main sources are, as the minister rightly said, soya and maize. We know that GM products have been included in animal feed in Scotland for some time. It could, therefore, be argued that the genie is already out of the bottle.</p><p>We know that the varieties of genetically <place-holder colnum=\"983\"/> modified crop that are available could conceivably have a number of benefits for people who farm and who consume farm products. There is little doubt that genetic modification can bring benefits. It might reduce the persistence in the environment of certain chemicals and the total amount of chemicals applied. It could also increase yields from existing agricultural land although, as we have heard, there are question marks as to whether that would be an appropriate objective to pursue. The concept of cheaper food is difficult for many farmers to understand, when they are selling food at prices that are cheaper than those at which food has ever been sold in living memory.</p><p>Genetically modified crops also have a number of potential pitfalls, many of which we have heard about, particularly from Kenny MacAskill. However the problems are perhaps rather too easy to highlight. As he anticipated someone might, I would suggest that Kenny slightly overstepped the mark, entering an area that some might consider as scaremongering.</p><p>In the past week, we have had announcements that there will be farm-scale trials of genetically modified crops in Scotland, particularly in the north-east. I am sure that today's debate is particularly pertinent for people who live in the Inverurie and Oldmeldrum areas of Aberdeenshire and will raise concerns about the issues of the past week.</p><p>When Ross Finnie, the Minister for Rural Affairs, announced that farm-scale trials were to take place, he did so in a letter to MSPs. In that letter, he said that the GM crops being tested had already undergone years of tests, both in laboratories and in carefully controlled sites. He added that the Executive's scientific advisers, all experts in their field, had concluded that the crops themselves did not present any direct threat to the environment, and were safe for humans and animals.</p><p>Therein lies a problem. I, as a Conservative and a farmer, can remember all too easily the situation that existed in the 1980s in relation to BSE. In spite of the people who like to take advantage of this&#8212;I am not looking at anybody in particular, George Lyon&#8212;I should point out that throughout the 1980s, the Conservative Government acted on best scientific advice, and decisions were made largely based on that advice. The fact remains that the scientific advice changed. At progressive stages of that crisis, it became obvious that decisions made on what appeared at the time to be sound advice were in some way flawed. For that reason, I have serious concerns about the scientific advice relating to this matter.</p>", "hdate": "2000-03-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13224435", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Genetic Modification Science"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Some weeks ago, two petitions came before the Rural Affairs Committee.

I have been lucky in being able, on occasion, to visit the Waldorf school in Aberdeen, and I look forward to visiting it again during its next open day. I have also been impressed by the support that has been shown by the parents of pupils at that school. One of the biggest items in my postbag last summer was the number of letters from parents at the Waldorf school who wanted the agenda of pluralism in education to be pushed forward. I have&#8212;independently of my colleague Brian Monteith&#8212;been convinced by their arguments. I will be delighted to support Brian when he proposes amendments that suggest ways in which state support might be provided to Steiner Waldorf schools.</p><p>The other points that I would like to make are more general and do not relate specifically to the proposals in the bill. We have already heard from members about the problems of providing an ideal education in some of the distant rural areas that are suffering from serious cuts in local government funding. I come from Aberdeenshire, and about three months ago I had the pleasure of receiving a letter from the school board at my daughter's school, telling me that Mackie Academy in Stonehaven would have to make &#163;78,000-worth of cuts in the first three months of this year. Although the management of the school is excellent and the behaviour of those responsible for managing the problem has been commendable, such a letter leaves parents with serious concerns about how the quality of education can be kept up in the face of cuts.</p><p>The biggest problem that the cuts cause&#8212;and one that has not been addressed properly in today's debate&#8212;is school closures. I made a few notes from Sam Galbraith's opening speech, in which he said that local funding has not been cut, that school funding is increasing, that every primary school will receive between &#163;3,000 and &#163;9,000 in additional grant and that schools will be properly resourced. When local government is under such pressure that school closures become inevitable, it is hard to tell anyone in the catchment <place-holder colnum=\"833\"/> area of such schools that education is receiving the treatment that the minister described. The truth is that there are stories of school closures in every rural local government area.</p><p>I know that I am sailing close to the wind, because when we highlighted this issue at question time, Peter Peacock pointed out that it is ironic that a Conservative raised the matter, given our party's record of closing schools in the past. The information that I continue to receive indicates that the Executive has taken up the challenge and is trying to compete with the record of all previous Governments on school closures. I hear today that five schools in Argyll might have to be closed. I have also been told that a primary school has been closed in the Stirling Council area in each of the past three years.</p><p>The pressure manifests itself most obviously at Boharm primary school in Mulben in the county of Moray. That school is in that strange area of Moray that is not part of the Highlands, but part of the north-east. That is why I have spoken about it before and why I am speaking about it again.</p><p>I was informed at lunch time that a request to the First Minister to consider the position of Boharm primary school in Mulben is still in his hands. Once again, I speak up for that school in that community in the hope that the First Minister will take the opportunity to ensure that the school continues to exist.</p>", "hdate": "2000-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13223847", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Standards in Scotland's Schools etc Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thought for a moment that Euan Robson was going to run away with most of my speech, but luckily he changed tack and moved off the rural issues.

Housing is of course very important in rural Scotland, yet statistics show that certain differences require to be highlighted.</p><p>The proportion of housing considered to be substandard has risen to 7 per cent in rural Scotland, compared with 4 per cent, according to figures that we have been given. Because housing is poorer in quality, other requirements have to be taken into account. I particularly welcome the minister's statement that she will target improvement grants at owner-occupiers who are least able to pay. Given the statistics, that would indicate that a higher proportion of that money will find its way to rural Scotland. I should be interested to hear what resources are likely to be available for that over the course of this parliamentary session.</p><p>I was also impressed by the minister saying that no party has a monopoly on putting people first. I remind her that the Conservatives have a record worthy of defence. As Lord James Douglas-Hamilton pointed out in his article earlier this week&#8212;and he was supported by Tommy Sheridan <place-holder colnum=\"106\"/> today&#8212;the policy that the minister presented is very much a Conservative policy, redeveloped to suit the purposes of the Executive today.</p><p>The one aspect of rural housing that the minister has not addressed&#8212;and I suggest that she consider addressing it&#8212;is the private rented sector in rural Scotland. Robert Brown raised the question of what constitutes rural housing. There are a number of definitions and, as he said, the definition being used would include Dumfries and Inverness. Housing in the genuinely rural parts of Scotland must be considered.</p><p>Figures given in the briefing by the Scottish Landowners Federation suggest that for housing that it defines as truly rural&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that is on farms and estates distant from concentrated centres of population\"&#8212;</p><p>as much of 57 per cent of rented housing stock is in the private sector. Given that much of that possible rented housing is empty, the Executive could make more investment available to develop that sector, to ensure that as many houses as possible are available for rent in rural Scotland. There are problems associated with competition in rents, which mean that many rural houses are unfit for human habitation because they would not realise a rent on the open market that would justify the investment to bring them up to the standard required. For that reason, housing in the genuinely rural parts of Scotland should be made available at a limited cost, with appropriate local support.</p><p>I feel a little guilty about reminding the Minister for Communities about rural housing in Scotland as she raised the issue herself, but I emphasise that aspects of rural housing need further consideration and could produce significant results from a relatively limited investment.</p>", "hdate": "2000-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13218177", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a privilege to be allowed to take part in the debate, and I take this opportunity to welcome much of what the minister said.

Part of the reason for that is that, as members may remember, Ross Finnie's Welsh counterpart, when she was appointed, was the source of several jokes, largely because she was a vegetarian.

The problems associated with the high value of sterling and high interest rates have been created to a significant extent by policies driven by the current Chancellor of the Exchequer in his desperate attempt to get our economy into line with that of Europe, so that ultimately he can join that single currency. If he took a broader view, considered the economic situation in this country and acted in such a way as to follow the needs of the farming industry rather than the needs of his own long-term economic aim, we would not be in the position in which we find ourselves today.</p><p>I endorse the view, expressed earlier by Alasdair Morgan, that transport costs are a major part of the problem faced by the industry. A farmer in the north or north-east of Scotland is almost 600 miles from the main market of Europe. Raw materials have to be hauled in over that distance and products have to be hauled out. The effect on the overall value of produce from the north and north-east of Scotland, as well as the rest of Scotland, is quite excessive, running into enormous amounts of money that we have simply not been able to find. That is why our industry no longer makes a profit.</p><p>I want to address one or two of the issues that Ross Finnie raised. I join him in saying that the disaster of the cull ewe scheme will be felt throughout the Highlands and Islands as well as in the lowland areas where sheep are produced. Hopes have been dashed as a result of that scheme failing to come to fruition. We must remember that the scheme was important for more than simply economic reasons. There were sound welfare and environmental reasons why the scheme should have been approved. The failure of the European Union to give permission for the scheme to go ahead is a disaster that will be felt in every corner of rural Scotland.</p><p>Perhaps that is a lesson to us in how we should deal with Agenda 2000 and the reforms that it will bring to Scottish farming. We must look carefully at how we implement European regulation. Too often in the past we have accused our own Government of gold-plating European regulation. We now have an ideal opportunity to consider a more constructive and positive way of interpreting European regulation in future, so that we can at last have the level playing field that we have been promised.</p><p>However, there is something that we can do and it is something that we need to do fairly quickly: we must pursue the opportunity to give fair competition to our producers. Representatives of the pig industry, for example, have been asking for a considerable period for the opportunity to have all meat products produced in the United Kingdom, <place-holder colnum=\"1199\"/> and particularly in Scotland, labelled with their country of origin. I have already submitted a written question on that subject, but it may not yet have come to the attention of the relevant ministers, so I shall raise it again today.</p><p>I suggest that not only may it be within the powers of this Parliament to demand that such labelling be introduced, but it may be within existing powers to demand the introduction of such labelling. It has been suggested to me that the powers of the Food Safety Act 1990 may allow ministers to ask for such labelling to be introduced. If that is the case, I ask that action be taken urgently to ensure that our pig producers have the opportunity to have their product out there in the market, identified as home-produced, so that they can reap the benefits of the investment that they have made. If the ministerial interpretation of that regulation is not as it has been described to me, it is important that action be taken as early as possible so that that opportunity can be taken and our pig farmers can be protected from unfair foreign competition.</p><p>I move, as an amendment to motion S1M-185, in the name of Ross Finnie, to leave out from \"and\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"but, recognising the unprecedented crisis facing our Scottish farmers, calls for additional steps to be taken to reverse the continuing decline in the economic fortunes of Scottish agriculture.\"</p>", "hdate": "1999-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13212929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agriculture (Agenda 2000)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have to say that I am not   endorsing the call, heard occasionally from certain parties in Scotland, to join the single currency.

I will not go into great depth, but will address a couple of issues briefly.</p><p>I think that Agenda 2000 will be more significant to the work that this Parliament does on rural affairs than the two references to it in the document suggest. We must remember that the United Kingdom is always accused of over-zealously implementing European regulations. When this Parliament gets the opportunity to consider European legislation&#8212;and with Agenda 2000 there will be a great deal of it&#8212;we must implement the regulations so as not to disadvantage Scotland's farmers, fishermen and rural dwellers.

As far as I know, that proposal was in our manifesto and the Liberal Democrats' manifesto; it also appears in the partnership agreement.

However, the priorities of Scottish Labour are the priorities of a predominantly urban party, which has superimposed its values on the rural communities of Scotland. I ask it to take the opportunity to look more closely at what can be done for Scotland's farming industry. We have always said that a strong farming industry underpins Scotland's rural economy. If we are not very careful, we will soon have no farming industry to do that underpinning. I ask that due consideration be given to that. </p><p>If we want to know what priorities we should pursue, we need look no further than the partnership document drawn up by the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats, from which I draw my evidence that this Administration understands the problems better than it is prepared to admit.
