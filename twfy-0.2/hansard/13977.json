In fleshing out what a town centre first principle means in practice, let us ensure that Glasgow and other places with city-based town centres are at the heart of measures to support Scotland&#8217;s town centres.</p><p>I am confident that that will happen. Following my intervention, the Scottish Government&#8217;s town centre regeneration fund included city-based town centres, and my city of Glasgow gained more than &#163;5 million, including &#163;1.8 million for Maryhill borough halls, which is a wonderful asset for the constituents that I represent.</p><p>However, there are less desirable businesses trading on our high streets and I would like any town centre action plan to deal with them. So-called payday lenders that offer instant cash to vulnerable Scots at exorbitant interest rates add nothing to our city and town centres except, perhaps, misery. They target families who are desperate for cash, offering apparent solutions that only push vulnerable people further into debt. We know that this is a huge and growing problem. More than 100 people contact Citizens Advice Scotland every week with debt problems that are linked to payday lending. I have no doubt that UK welfare cuts to our most needy will be linked to the growth in that area, but that is perhaps a debate for another day.</p><p>It is no accident that payday lending establishments often locate themselves beside communities that are struggling the most financially. I do not believe that it is right, acceptable or ethical that someone who is struggling financially can walk into an instant-cash shop and borrow money at an annual percentage rate of nearly 4,000 per cent. I checked the rates today. Such rip-off rates are available right now in Maryhill shopping centre, Springburn shopping centre, Rutherglen&#8217;s main street and across Scotland.</p><p>Short of independence, we cannot tackle such unsavoury and undesirable lending practices on our high streets as directly as we might like. Of course, yet again, that is an argument for another day. However, this Parliament, in partnership with our local authorities, must do all that it can to rid our town centres of these outlets, whether we do so via planning, licensing, taxation powers or another mechanism. We must use every tool that we can to ensure that our town centres do not promote such practices.</p><p>I call on the minister to convene a summit to co-ordinate efforts to clamp down on such payday lending practices on our high streets. I genuinely believe that, together, we can come to a clear consensus that shops offering 4,000 per cent loans to those who are most in debt have no place at the heart of our high streets, and that we can find a way to take action to tackle this scurrilous problem.</p><p>Thank you for your indulgence, Presiding Officer.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22847317", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Town Centre Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Glasgow has many town centres that are quite distinct from its city centre.

He said that our contributions should be &#8220;substantial&#8221; and &#8220;thoughtful&#8221;. If the Parliament takes such an approach to planning Scotland&#8217;s NHS we will be in a good place. However, with respect, I genuinely do not think that that is what Mr Findlay has brought to Parliament this afternoon.</p><p>I will consider two themes: how we deal quickly and efficiently with challenges when they emerge in short order; and how we do long-term planning. The Scottish Government does both well but, more important, it will listen to suggestions about how we can do better. I heard no such suggestions from the Labour Party during the opening speech.</p><p>I was going to mention the hidden waiting lists under Labour in 2006, but in a spirit of consensus I will not go down that painful road for the Labour Party. Instead, I will consider challenges that the Scottish Government has encountered in relation to the NHS. Health boards, in particular NHS Lothian, had issues with the recording of waiting lists and availability in Scotland. Through the Parliament&#8217;s pretty robust structure and the audit process, recommendations were made, and Scotland and the Parliament acted quickly. We are now in a strong position: we have a system of patient-advised availability and complete openness and transparency. That did not happen as a result of a review of the entire NHS. It happened as a result of the Government and the Parliament and its committee system responding to the challenges that presented.</p><p>On waiting time targets, I will pick one that is good for the Government. In September 2013, our 18-week waiting time target was 90 per cent and was met; 90.9 per cent was achieved. I have no doubt that that was due to investment and the real-terms increase in funding of the NHS by the Scottish Government, which I do not think would have happened under a different Government.</p><p>However, depending on which waiting times we look at, targets are not always met. In a few months NHS boards will come before the Health and Sport Committee and I will ask them what they are doing to reprioritise their resources to meet targets in which they have fallen short. This is about targets being constantly under review and scrutinised, and it is about continuous improvement in the NHS. Just to say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s review everything&#8221; is meaningless, but that is what is offered in the motion.</p><p>An example of where Parliament got it right that immediately springs to mind is regulation of care for older people. As cabinet secretary, Nicola Sturgeon listened to an inquiry by the Health and Sport Committee and, before we had reported, moved to address the situation. Again, that was the result of an immediate response by Parliament. It was not just a general review for the sake of having a general review.</p><p>Alternatively, there could be a more thoughtful review, at which Jackson Carlaw hinted. The review of access to new medicines was thoughtful and considered. It was not a short-term populist soapbox reaction to an issue; it was about making access in Scotland fair and robust in the future for patients, families and the NHS&#8212;not just for a couple of years, but for a generation. I hope that we will have some fantastic news on that in the very near future.</p><p>Let us just deal with the facts, not the spin. Staff numbers look good for the Scottish Government. The facts are that qualified nurses and midwives are up 2.7 per cent compared to the situation under Labour, medical consultants are up 28 per cent, and GPs are up 5.5 per cent. Are there workload issues? Are there issues about staff management and planning? Of course there are. That is why, in conjunction with the RCN, the Scottish Government brought forward workforce and workload management tools in nursing to address the problems. I look forward to more information on how we will tackle other staffing problems.

In the three years up to 2014-15, &#163;500&#160;million is being invested in change funds. As the report that is before us notes, the draft budget for 2012-13 said:</p><p>&#8220;Together it is anticipated that national and local government and their community planning partners will invest up to &#163;500&#160;million through these change funds to support the greater alignment of budgets across the public sector on a preventative and outcomes-focused basis.&#8221;</p><p>I suppose that that leaves us asking, &#8220;What does that actually mean?&#8221; For my part, it means reforming public service delivery in a way that best delivers the outcomes that we all want to see.</p><p>I have a particular interest in active ageing and the health of our older population, so among the outcomes that I would like to see being achieved&#8212;to which the Scottish Government has a clear commitment and to which I am sure that members across the Parliament have a joint commitment&#8212;are older people being happier and healthier and staying in their own homes for longer before having to move to a residential setting, if that is necessary; their making fewer unplanned visits to hospital acute services because of slips, trips, falls and so on; and fewer of them being stuck in hospital wards for longer than they need to be as a result of delayed discharge.</p><p>In recent weeks, Alex Neil, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, has talked about having a seven-day healthcare service to help achieve those outcomes. We are trying to achieve quite clear outcomes using change fund money. I hugely welcome the use of &#163;420&#160;million in the change fund for older people between 2011 and 2016, including &#163;70&#160;million in the budget that will be before us early next year.</p><p>However, we also have to scrutinise the good and effective use of those moneys in achieving those outcomes, some of which I have mentioned. For example, we want to ensure that change fund moneys transition into the core financial budgets that health boards and local authorities set in order to better mainstream any initiatives that are developed through the change funds.</p><p>As the Finance Committee has said, we need to examine how we can encourage local authorities to make a greater contribution to the change funds. Health and social care integration for older people is currently being legislated on through the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill, which is before the Parliament, and we need to think more carefully about how we carry out robust budget scrutiny of single accounts under the bodies corporate that will involve local authorities and health boards. We have to come to terms with scrutiny in relation to that issue as well.</p><p>The outcomes are easy to measure but they are challenging to achieve, and the framework that I mentioned will be important in ensuring that we can achieve them. The Finance Committee&#8217;s report refers to what the Health and Sport Committee said about the lack of a clear link between the draft budget and the indicators. I have been on the Health and Sport Committee for a number of years and there is almost a necessary tension between the budget and the indicators, given that individual health boards have local strategies to identify and address some of the indicators and that there is also a disconnect between when the Parliament sets the budget for health boards at a national level and when health boards set their own budgets. There is a scrutiny issue in there, too. I think that we can improve, but I see a necessary tension as regards how we can go further. I think that it is up to Parliament to suggest how we can do that better.</p><p>I will come to the Barnett consequentials in a second, but in relation to the moneys in the budget that we are considering&#8212;the existing moneys&#8212;I have noticed that not one person from the Labour Party has said how one existing pound would be spent elsewhere, despite Labour&#8217;s repeated demands that we spend lots of money in lots of different places. That critical fault line runs through the Labour Party&#8217;s approach to budget scrutiny.</p><p>I see that Mr Rennie is in the chamber. He will be delighted to hear that my commitment to extending childcare has not waned; in fact, it is stronger than it has ever been. However, I have had a commitment to kinship care payments and to the roll-out and extension of free school meals for just as long as I have had a commitment to extending childcare. Each of those commitments has to be individually funded and paid for on an on-going basis. There are challenges in that regard, and there are decisions that everyone has to make&#8212;including me, Mr Rennie.</p><p>The free school meals pilot, which was carried out by the Scottish Government in partnership with local authorities, was pretty successful, but it was discontinued because of cuts from the UK Government. That is an example of a pilot that was brought to Scotland by a Scottish Government but which was directly undermined by UK Government spending decisions. We have to bear that in mind.</p><p>As we look at the budget, it is worth putting on record other potential spending consequences for the Parliament. We know that there is a cross-party effort elsewhere in the UK to take &#163;4&#160;billion away from Scotland by scrapping the Barnett formula. We also know of estimates of a multi-billion pound saving from the NHS in England with the greater use of private funds there. Those two examples have potential spending consequences that put Scotland at risk financially. Yes, I want that step change in childcare&#8212;I want to dramatically improve childcare&#8212;but I want to ensure that we get that improvement not just for a short time but in perpetuity.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Finance Committee for its detailed and thoughtful report on the draft budget for 2014-15.

That is the reality, yet increasing UK debt is being used as an excuse to make drastic and swingeing cuts to the welfare payments of some of the most vulnerable people in Scottish society. That attack on our most vulnerable could result in &#163;4.5 billion being taken from welfare by 2014-15.</p><p>The reality of that is that working tax credit reforms, for example, will take &#163;3,870 from working families every year. In terms of the childcare element of that, there will be &#163;1,560 less.</p><p>If we look at the working tax credit reforms by the UK coalition in the round, we see that 372,000 families will be worse off to the tune of, on average, &#163;810 a year.

I thought that I knew how to say &#8220;maxillofacial prosthetists&#8221;, but every member has said it differently, which has somewhat undermined my confidence. I will use the word &#8220;confidence&#8221; again.</p><p>I also congratulate the wider team at the Southern general hospital and Glasgow royal infirmary. Michael O&#8217;Neil won the award, but there is a variety of experts in the department who excel in the field.</p><p>I wanted to speak in the debate for a number of reasons. One is that, as a Glasgow member of the Scottish Parliament, I wanted to recognise and acknowledge the very best practice in the world&#8212;the world-leading practice&#8212;that is clearly evident there. I am also the deputy convener of the Health and Sport Committee, and am interested in finding out more about the issue. Perhaps with my Glasgow colleague James Dornan and the minister, I hope, we can go along and see in action the good work at the Southern general hospital.</p><p>I also have a personal reason that I had forgotten about for wanting to speak in the debate. As a daft laddie in Dundee around 20 years ago, I took a tumble. I questioned my relationship with alcohol on that particular day, but I took a tumble nevertheless and was left with a fairly dramatic hole in my chin. As I was regaining consciousness, the doctors who were attending to me were debating whether they should try to reconstruct the hole in my chin or put it to the plastic specialist in Dundee. Fortunately for me, they put it to the plastic specialist. The difference that that made to the scar that I was left with on my chin was quite dramatic. It is now pretty minimal.</p><p>Nanette Milne mentioned confidence. I am not comparing that trivial event with the more dramatic life-changing events that other members have mentioned, but it meant that I had a small beard for a year or so afterwards because I was embarrassed by my scar, which undermined my self-confidence. If something as trivial as that can undermine a young man&#8217;s self-confidence, I can only imagine the impact that a full facial reconstruction can have. We have to look at the major technological advances, but we should not forget that little, minor miracles are performed every day of the week. As a young man who was making my way in the world, what happened made a huge difference to my quality of life. I have no idea who the plastic surgeon was, but I thank them greatly, as the work made a difference to my life.</p><p>I want to quote a colleague, Ken Andrew. He does not work in Glasgow, but he is involved in prosthetics&#8212;not facial prosthetics but limb prosthetics. I asked him what he had heard about maxillofacial prosthetisists&#8212;I said that wrongly; never mind. He dropped me an email before the debate in which he mentioned the great expertise and the advances that there have been, but he also said a couple of things that were particularly powerful:</p><p>&#8220;The impact these technicians have on the improved well being of individuals that have suffered devastating injury through trauma and disease is very hard to imagine ... Max fax technicians are true artisans with the very best of them possessing genuine artistic talent.&#8221;</p><p>We are not talking just about the high-end stuff, but about the attention to minor details that those experts provide.</p><p>I have run over my time, Presiding Officer, and I thank you for your patience in listening.

A lot of positive work has been done on the bill.</p><p>I begin by making it clear that I wish that the Parliament did not need to pass the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill. The integration of health and social care has been an aspiration for many years, but a reality far too rarely. The bill will set up an overarching framework to deliver integration and, as a last resort, compel health boards and local authorities to get on with the job of integration where that is not happening.</p><p>I will go on to talk about structures shortly, but first I will say a bit more about what the bill hopes to achieve. We have already heard a great deal about the demographic challenges that Scotland will face with an ageing population. The objective is to have a unified health and social care strategy for our older population that suits the needs of older people and ensures that the person is put before the pound sign&#8212;in other words, that cost shunting between health boards and local authorities becomes a thing of the past. That means having a single budget for the health and social care of older people.</p><p>For too long, there has been a suspicion that there is a tension between speedy discharge and delayed discharge from our hospitals. The longer a patient is in hospital, the greater the cost to the NHS, and the earlier an older person is returned into the community, the greater the cost to local authorities. In what way is the patient, rather than the pound sign, at the centre of that? I do not think that the matter is necessarily a high enough priority at present. If we have a single budget, put people before pounds and have a truly integrated health and social care system, we can end that cost shunting once and for all.</p><p>We need a disaggregation of acute budgets. I am delighted that the Scottish Government shared with us some estimates of what proportion of acute budgets may be disaggregated and put towards combined health and social care, but there are still no real projections of what sections of local authority budgets will be put towards that. Will it just be whatever budget lines local authorities identify from their own social care budgets, or do we need to be a bit more sophisticated about it?</p><p>I know that we are not going as far as housing at the moment, but an argument could be made that there is a direct link to housing adaptations and policy. If we can get older people in an ageing population back into their houses and they are happy and safe there, they will be content, and sometimes that will be cheaper than having them in hospitals or residential homes. We have to think in a more sophisticated way about joint budgets for health and social care, and we need more clarity about the expectations on local authorities.</p><p>As I said, this is not just about saving money. It is about getting older people out of hospital sooner, preventing them from going into hospital in the first place and having them live at home happily for longer. That is not just cheaper but better in relation to outcomes. We have to look at the outcomes that the bill seeks to deliver rather than just structures, but of course we have to look at structures, too.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22763087", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I note that Nanette Milne&#8217;s thoughtful speech did the job of stage 1 scrutiny very well.

If kinship carers were not there to pick up the pieces, the life chances and life outcomes for such children would be far worse. That would also cost Scotland&#8217;s councils a small fortune, as they would instead need to use foster carers or residential care for those vulnerable children.</p><p>I pay tribute to our former children&#8217;s minister Adam Ingram for advancing the cause of kinship care under the SNP Government that was elected in 2007. Putting a kinship care outcome into the Scottish Government&#8217;s concordat with councils was vital. That sought to move to parity the financial support given to kinship carers and that given to foster carers. Clearly, although that aspiration was not fully met, that has made a real difference. I agree with the Child Poverty Action Group, which told the Education and Culture Committee:</p><p>&#8220;The initial agreement, which was to pay kinship carers of looked-after children at a rate equivalent to that for foster carers, has not become a reality, but all local authorities have shifted to a position where they are making payments of some sort to kinship carers of looked-after children. Quite a few local authorities are also making payments at some level to kinship carers of non-looked-after children.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 24 September 2013; c 2821.]</p><p>That is not enough, but we have driven a real change and it is important to put that on record.</p><p>Some kinship carers have asked me why the financial memorandum includes projected cost savings from kinship care. They ask how improvements can be made in the support for kinship carers while cost savings are also expected. However, the financial memorandum states that one reason for developing the kinship care order is</p><p>&#8220;to reduce unchecked growth in formal kinship care&#8221;.</p><p>In other words, as children in kinship care come to the attention of social work or are placed in kinship care by social work&#8212;a vital distinction that, if I have time, I will return to later&#8212;they are less likely to become formally looked after. Kinship care orders will still provide support, but a crucial point is that the level of direct social work involvement will necessarily be less than if the child was deemed to be formally looked after.</p><p>I understand that the bill will lead to a projected saving in social work time, and that is the saving referred to in the financial memorandum. Fundamentally, those savings do not signal a reduction in direct cash support to kinship carers, but I would welcome some clarity and reassurance from the minister on that when she sums up the debate.</p><p>I also ask for some certainty that the bill does not put up any barriers to providing financial support to kinship carers. Can the minister confirm that the bill contains nothing that would instruct councils to pay less or, indeed, hinder them from paying more?</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a privilege to speak in the debate.

Those payments are not enough, but I welcome them. However, the council makes a distinction between situations in which granny and granddad have decided to look after the vulnerable child, because they know that the child is at risk, and situations in which the local authority has turned up on the doorstep and placed the child with granny and granddad. In one case, the local authority has stepped in, whereas in the other case there is a voluntary arrangement, but I do not think that distinctions should be drawn when providing financial support for those families. I ask the Government to consider that.</p><p>The final thing that I would like to mention is the need for consistency in social work assessments of kinship carers across the country.

Better guidance, better training and more consistency in social work assessments would also be welcome.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for that intervention.

When, in the days ahead, the Scottish Government publishes its white paper on independence, there will be certainty and clarity about what an independent Scotland would look like and aspire to if, following a yes vote, an SNP Government is returned in the 2016 elections. As for plan B, without independence, there will be a commitment to continue to stand up for Scotland&#8217;s interests at every opportunity and, if given the honour, to continue to be a responsible Scottish Government.</p><p>However, the need for a plan B cuts both ways. The Labour Party contends that the only way to protect Scotland&#8217;s interest is to elect a UK Labour Party to a Westminster Government, which rarely, if ever, has Scotland on its radar never mind as a priority. The Labour Party plan A includes nuclear weapons and power, draining our oil and gas and other natural resources and sticking to Tory capital cuts to Scotland. That is a weak and ineffective proposition to put to the Scottish people.</p><p>What about plan B? That includes even more welfare reform and sticking to the bedroom tax. I was about to go through a long list of what plan B would mean, but the Labour Party would implement those measures, too, were it elected as the UK Government. Plan A is not satisfactory for the Scottish people and plan B is to play Russian roulette with Scotland&#8217;s future and to let the Tories loose on Scotland with a future UK Tory Government. That is unacceptable; it is why the referendum bill must be passed and why the people must vote yes in the independence referendum.</p><p>I will mention a couple of obvious things arising from my work in the Parliament that tell me on an elementary basis why we need independence. First, as deputy convener of the Health and Sport Committee, I know that every time there is a &#163;1 million disinvestment from the health service in England, our committee is looking at &#163;98,000 less spent on the Scottish health service. That is simply unacceptable.</p><p>On a local level, what else is unacceptable is that a wonderful group called Rosemount Workspace, which works with vulnerable young people furthest away from the labour market, cannot get some young people into education courses because of UK benefit rules. The UK Government will not change the rules; Angela Constance, the Minister for Youth Employment, would if she could. That is why I want independence&#8212;not as an end in and of itself but for the future of Scotland&#8217;s young people.

As deputy convener of the Health and Sport Committee, I often meet stakeholder groups in health and social care&#8212;be they doctors groups, nurses groups, allied health professionals, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacists, social workers, addiction workers or occupational therapists. I could go on and on, but do not worry, Presiding Officer, I will not.</p><p>I mentioned that list of groups because I am sure that for all those stakeholders, the user&#8212;the patient&#8212;is their primary concern. However, every group also has a specific interest and a specific point of view that sometimes contrasts with and be different from the interests and views of other stakeholders. Person-centred healthcare and social care should see the interests of such stakeholders&#8212;vested interests, if you like; I mean that kindly, not negatively&#8212;as being secondary to the needs of the constituents; the people we represent, who are the service users.</p><p>Progress has been made: for instance, GP surgeries are now open for longer and their hours are more flexible. I have listened to some of the concerns that have been raised, but it is now easier, in many cases, to see a GP than it was previously. That is a positive change.</p><p>I am pleased that the HEAT&#8212;health improvement, efficiency and governance, access and treatment&#8212;target that was introduced in 2007 to ensure that all patients see an appropriate member of the GP practice team within 48 hours has been met in almost every health board; Fife just missed out. That target&#8217;s having been met means that more than 90 per cent of patients see an appropriate person within 48 hours.</p><p>There should, however, be no complacency about that; targets tell only part of the story, which is why I am delighted that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing has looked for unintended consequences from that 48-hour target and is considering more imaginatively at how we can use the GP contract better to meet the needs of our constituents. On that last point, I also took part in the keys to life debate on learning disabilities, and I know that the Scottish Government is actively considering the possibility of having a quality and outcomes framework in relation to people with learning disabilities and the special attention and support that they need from GPs.</p><p>I welcome that possibility, but this is not just about GPs. Perhaps health centres more generally should consider services beyond 9 to 5 and 5 days a week. Why should we single out GPs? Associated support services also have to be in the health centre; if a person has to see a community nurse after they see their doctor, does not it make sense to have community nurses in the health centre on Saturday morning if GPs are working on Saturday morning? We have to think more imaginatively about how we can use the overall resource. I am delighted to know that there are on-going discussions on how we might do that.</p><p>I am also encouraged that the Scottish Government has established a person-centred health and social care collaborative; its third meeting will be held shortly. I am sure that the 500 stakeholders will consider how services can be developed in the long term. I looked at the remit of the collaborative and was delighted to see that one aspect of the remit is to focus on what we can do now, because sometimes when such things are set up, it is &#8220;Ma&#241;ana&#8221;; it is about what can be done in two years, three years or four years. However, the collaborative is actively looking at what can be done in the short term&#8212;-in the months and the years ahead&#8212;and not just in the long term, important though long-term planning is.</p><p>I also welcome the fact that the Scottish Government is giving &#163;4&#160;million to five health boards, including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde in my area, to look at innovative ways of delivering a seven-day health service and of enhancing round-the-clock care. Let me give two examples of that&#8212;although I should perhaps first, like Mr Findlay, declare a slight interest, in that my wife is a nurse in a high dependency unit in Glasgow, and has worked in a variety of capacities in surgical nursing.</p><p>If a patient is ready for discharge, but staff cannot get hold of the pharmacist because the pharmacy is closed, that can lead to a delayed discharge. If, before going home, a patient needs to be declared fit and capable, or able to use appropriately and safely any support equipment that he or she has been given, the patient cannot go home if the physiotherapist is not around. Therefore, we need to look more imaginatively at when various health professionals are on ward, on call, in the hospital or in the health centre. I hope that that &#163;4&#160;million will help us to think of good ideas for how to do that.</p><p>I am also pleased that the Scottish Government is looking to make both health and social care more person centred. That is welcome, given how liberating self-directed support can be for individuals. Self-directed support has had some negative press, because a number of local authorities have introduced it as a cost-cutting exercise rather than because they adhere to its principles. It is therefore only reasonable that I mention how my local authority has treated people with learning disabilities in the context of its day-centre reforms and closures.</p><p>In its briefing for today&#8217;s debate, the Health and Social Care Alliance says that there should be shared decision making when changes happen, but there was no shared decision making between Glasgow City Council and learning disabled individuals and their families, who were just told that their centres would close. That approach goes completely against the principles both of person-centred care and of self-directed support. As the Learning Disability Alliance Scotland has said, in designing services we should apply the principle, &#8220;Nothing about us without us&#8221;, but that was simply not the case in Glasgow.</p><p>I thank the cabinet secretary for offering Glasgow City Council the chance to think again about the proposals to close three day centres, and for offering to work in partnership with the council, but I am disappointed that the council seems to have snubbed that offer. However, we live to fight another day on that one.</p><p>To come back to the positive aspects of person-centred care, I should mention some good work that already takes place. Revive MS in Glasgow already offers person-centred care not just to people who have multiple sclerosis, but to families who support MS patients. However, person-centred care is always work in progress. For example, my constituent Mr James Jamieson has contacted me about the need to support people who are living with hidradenitis, which is a brutal skin condition, and how we can improve care for such patients.

Our findings are based on robust scrutiny and evidence.</p><p>Although our committee has not formally considered the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to our recommendations, given that many of our recommendations seem to have been accepted by the Scottish Government, I am sure that&#8212;in general terms if not on all the specifics&#8212;committee members will welcome much of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response. Of course, as the cabinet secretary would expect, detailed scrutiny by our committee will follow. We will also look through the Official Report of today&#8217;s debate to see how best to take matters forward as a committee.</p><p>On the SMC system more generally, in my view our inquiry&#8217;s aim was not to fix a system that was broken but to improve a system for approval and access to medicines that was already considered world leading. Malcolm Chisholm also made that point. We looked at the quality-adjusted life year, which we have heard much about during today&#8217;s debate. In paragraph 71 of our report, we said:</p><p>&#8220;No one argued that there was a better system than the QALY for assessing the value offered by competing treatments&#8221;.</p><p>However, despite that assertion by our committee, the next three words in the quote, which is incomplete, are vital&#8212;they are &#8220;despite its limitations.&#8221; The committee sought to move forward beyond those limitations, which is why we urged the Scottish Government to</p><p>&#8220;review as a matter of priority how modifiers and thresholds are applied to better take account of orphan and ultra-orphan conditions, end of life and innovation&#8221;.</p><p>Of course we want the details of that review, but I am delighted to hear that the SMC has already started the process and that we expect a report back to the cabinet secretary before Christmas. The committee decided that the matter is pressing and I am glad that the Government appears to have moved speedily on it.</p><p>I want to raise the matter of modifiers and thresholds, because to focus only on the IPTR system would be to ignore a key issue in our inquiry, which is why the SMC was turning down certain medicines for approval in the first place. In my opinion, that led to the IPTR process being used as a backdoor approval mechanism, for which it was never designed.</p><p>In giving evidence to the committee, Eric Low of Myeloma UK repeatedly made the point&#8212;I am not quoting directly; rather, I am going from memory&#8212;that we need to design a system that gets more yeses by the SMC first time but in a fair and consistent manner. I believe that we will achieve that through the review of the QALY modifiers, combined with a number of other matters. The first of those is having a pause in the SMC process. In England, if it looks as though discussions between the pharmaceutical companies and NICE are not going to lead to a yes, there is a pause in the process to allow people to reconsider rather than take entrenched positions. That is a sensible proposal and I am glad that the Government is taking it forward. There are also recommendations, to which I will return if there is time, on taking a wider view of value and cost effectiveness in relation to approval of medicines in Scotland.</p><p>An issue that could have been controversial but which did not turn out to be because of the sensitive way in which our committee handled it was the matter of the cancer drugs fund in England and end-of-life conditions. I was going to read some quotes from the report but, because of time constraints, I will not do so. However, the committee unanimously ruled out a cancer drugs fund in Scotland. I pay tribute to Nanette Milne for sensitively handling the way in which we got to that cross-party consensus. Needless to say, the committee agreed that we should not single out any end-of-life condition but that we should instead improve our system in a fair, consistent and evidence-based manner. That is why the committee ruled out a cancer drugs fund.</p><p>I have spoken about the enhanced modifier for the SMC to take greater cognisance of end-of-life conditions. Of course, that is only part of the solution to dealing with end-of-life conditions and, in particular, cancer. As we have heard, no system will always say yes, so individual patient treatment requests become crucial. Paragraph 62 in our report makes a number of recommendations that lean towards a national system of individual patient treatment requests, with a desire to move away from exceptionality, which has been mentioned. We believe that exceptionality was a flawed basis on which to move forward with patient treatment requests.</p><p>The cabinet secretary&#8217;s response to those recommendations is perhaps to rip up the IPTR system, so the committee will now have to take a decision on the peer-approved clinical system. Intuitively, I am drawn towards that. In the debate, we have heard of a number of examples of clinicians saying that there was a strong evidence base for an end-of-life medicine and that it would make a material difference to their patient, yet the request was still refused. If the peer-approved clinical system does what it appears to say on the tin, that situation will become a thing of the past, which I warmly welcome. Of course, the committee will have to hold back on taking a position, to allow us to consider in more detail how the new approach will be rolled out.</p><p>As the convener, Duncan McNeil, did, I ask the cabinet secretary to consider the use of modifiers in the SMC process before the new system comes into place and to consider how area drug and therapeutics committees will view exceptionality in the transitional period until the peer-approved clinical system comes into place. My strong call&#8212;I do not have the convener&#8217;s permission to make it, but I am sure that I speak with the committee&#8217;s consent&#8212;is that we would expect every area drug and therapeutics committee to take cognisance of peer-approved clinical recommendations for drugs now and not to wait until the formal system comes into place. I think that I am on safe ground with the committee in saying that.</p><p>A delay can occur in medicines that the SMC has approved finding their way on to local formularies. On my reading of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response to the committee, that is one of the few instances when he is not on the same ground as the committee. The committee looked at the idea of making a national formulary available locally and making medicines available consistently and readily within the 30-day period that is set out. The cabinet secretary has given assurances about the speed with which medicines will be put on local formularies but has not necessarily accepted the idea of a national formulary. However, I note that the Scottish Government&#8217;s response talked about</p><p>&#8220;the implementation of certain medicines of key clinical importance though discussion and agreement of the relevant specialists within NHSScotland to ensure ... outcomes for patients in all parts of Scotland are optimised&#8221;,</p><p>which will be made available on a national basis outwith local formularies. That moves part of the way towards the committee&#8217;s recommendation. The committee will of course have to look at that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698796", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to New Medicines"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will hold a sweepstake among the back benchers on how long it will be before Mr Findlay gets his second compliment.

I also congratulate the Parliament on the fact that we are debating a motion with no amendments. I suspect that that shows that members across all the parties are keen to unite as a Parliament as this piece of work goes forward to ensure that we come together not just to increase protections for society but to do more to rehabilitate those who have been through the judicial process.</p><p>The best way in which to keep the public safe is to prevent offenders from reoffending in the first place. Blocking the path to education, training and employment would clearly be counterproductive in relation to reducing reoffending rates. Indeed, the evidence shows that placing barriers to employment and so forth makes reoffending far more likely.</p><p>It is with that in mind that I view both the debate generally and the terms of the review of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 specifically. As the cabinet secretary mentioned, that act determines when former prisoners or those who have received non-prison sentences have to disclose to employers the fact that they have had convictions. Seemingly populist attempts to make society safer can be counterproductive and make us less safe. I hope that we can get cross-party agreement on that.</p><p>I will be interested to hear how the Government seeks to amend the 1974 act and its proposals on when disclosure of previous offending should be required. I note that the cabinet secretary is open to suggestions on how the law should change and that he has restated that there should be no dilution of protection for vulnerable groups and appropriate protection when employees have access to at-risk client groups. That is vital.</p><p>It seems rather arbitrary that those who go to prison for two and a half years or less no longer have to disclose a conviction after a certain period of time because it becomes spent, but that if they do a day more than 30 months they must disclose it ad infinitum. That does not make sense. It seems to involve drawing a line in the sand just for the sake of it.</p><p>There is a similar position for alternatives to prison. Whether a person has to disclose an offence depends on which of the two categories they are in&#8212;namely those with community payback orders and those with fines. That does not make sense to me.</p><p>We do not need to overhaul the system, but we need to look at it again, take a weather check on it and modernise it. We seem to have started to do that. I note from a briefing for this debate that a 2013 order means that we can go the other way when that is required, such as in relation to those who seek employment in what could be considered industries that may attract more unsavoury types. I know that, given the problems that we have had with the security industry, people continue to have to disclose certain convictions in it, and I could mention other such industries.</p><p>I would be interested to know whether the cabinet secretary has given further thought to whether people should always have to disclose certain convictions depending on the sector in which they seek to be employed, not because they deal with vulnerable groups but perhaps because their area of the economy is targeted by serious organised criminals. We should give thought to that as well.</p><p>Of course, there is another side of the coin. The issue is not just about trying to reduce reoffending; it is also about society&#8217;s duty to rehabilitate offenders. Graeme Pearson mentioned 1,308 projects, but he might want to revise that to 1,309 because I am about to mention another one that is developing in north Glasgow; I would like to draw the cabinet secretary&#8217;s attention to it.</p><p>The project is run by Open Gates, which operates on the old Pars bakery site near Possil in an old derelict building that the charity has restored with the support of Scottish Canals. The charity is working in a positive and constructive way with five national top-end former prisoners who are out on licence to make sure that they have the support and skills that they need to progress with their lives. The volunteer-led project allows them to gain a series of skills, such as upholstery, wood turning, carpentry, French polishing and strip and dip of wood and metal.</p><p>The model is that those lifers&#8212;or life-licensed individuals&#8212;can become volunteers who work with low-level young offenders in the community. They give peer support and skills to young people who have offended and who we wish not to reoffend. That vital project will add something to tackling reoffending rates.</p><p>I have written to the cabinet secretary in the past few weeks specifically in relation to that project and I have asked him to come and visit it. I hope that in his summing up he will confirm that he will come and see the good work that is being done in the Possil area to tackle reoffending and the peer support that is being offered.</p><p>In the time I have left, I want to mention one gentleman whom I have permission to say a little about. David Crimin is a former lifer who was convicted when he was 16 years old and who served 16 years in prison. He is now 42. In his 10 years of freedom he has always worked voluntarily. From responding to requests from the elderly to wallpaper and paint rooms to cutting hair for friends and family, he has always kept himself busy. He is now a valuable part of the team at Open Gates, which hopes to give him his first full-time job. He also has qualifications in bricklaying, painting and decorating and hairdressing.</p><p>I could say a lot more about David, but the one thing I want to say is that, although he got many of those skills while he was in prison, because of the stigma of being in prison and the associated barriers to employment he is only now really able to use them. Via Open Gates, he hopes to pass his skills on to young people who, we hope, will not start on a life of crime. By providing peer support and rehabilitation, such projects can prevent them from taking that path.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation of Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mary Fee on what I thought was a fine speech.

I welcome the publication of the &#8220;Keys to life&#8221; strategy, which is the second ten-year strategy for tackling learning disabilities and ensuring that independent living is at the heart of everything that we do.</p><p>The strategy quite rightly builds on a relatively successful strategy that was commissioned by the previous Executive&#8217;s &#8220;The same as you?&#8221; publication. That strategy saw a move away from long-stay beds, which has resulted in there being 1,000 fewer, over the years. It also saw a move away from the traditional day centre set-up. I welcome both of those changes, but I am also heartened to hear the minister say that there is still an essential role for day centres in some circumstances. In my experience, it may even be a desirable role in some circumstances. I will speak about that later.</p><p>While the second strategy was a long time in the making, it was right to take two years to evaluate the previous 10-year strategy and to run that through the national learning disability strategy group. All stakeholders can rightfully say that they have had a key partnership role in producing this second 10-year strategy.</p><p>I want to focus initially on some of the health recommendations. The Learning Disability Alliance Scotland said in its very helpful submission that that is the right thing to do. I might also refer to some of those points later if I have time. There is a 20-year reduced life expectancy for adults with learning difficulties, and many learning-disabled individuals have complex learning needs and multimorbidities. It is only right that the health recommendations be a major focus of the strategy.</p><p>It is also quite right that we quantify the extent of the issue before we can fully address problems and barriers. That is why I welcome recommendations 9 to 12, particularly the new HEAT&#8212;health improvement, efficiency and governance, access and treatment&#8212;target that is to be developed to identify and track just how the learning-disabled are using the national health service. In a few years we will ask ourselves why we never tracked that use in the first place. It is clearly the right thing to do, not just for its own sake but, as the strategy makes clear, to identify trends and patterns. I assume that it will also help us to identify areas where improvement is needed, and help us to understand key issues better, such as the unnecessary deaths that still occur within the learning-disabled communities.</p><p>The most significant aspect of the recommendations is the attempt to identify and track the social work resources that are provided to the learning-disabled using the unique NHS number that every learning-disabled individual has, like the rest of us. That will be important and I will perhaps say more about that later, if I have time.</p><p>In terms of the broad thrust of the health improvements that we seek, I commend the recommendation on oral health, and with regard to epilepsy, I welcome the greater access to specialist nurses at an appropriate time. I will welcome greater access to neurological services, should we make it a reality.</p><p>A meaningful improvement could be made the next time the general practitioners&#8217; contract is reviewed. It would perhaps be worth having within that contract a special indicator of how GPs deal with the learning-disabled. We should also mention the greater advocacy needs that the learning-disabled may have in accessing GPs and other services, and the greater time that they may need with the GP. There is a lot to welcome within the health aspect of the strategy.</p><p>I also give a nod to recommendation 7, which suggests that local authorities and NHS boards should, by 2015, have joint commissioning plans to</p><p>&#8220;take account of the needs of people with learning disabilities&#8221;.</p><p>Recommendation 7 also says that plans should maximise &#8220;independence and control&#8221;. That is clearly the direction of travel in which we want public policy to go to meet the needs of our learning-disabled communities.</p><p>I will concentrate now on recommendations on traditional social care and independent living. In doing so, I will&#8212;as members could probably predict&#8212;mention Glasgow City Council&#8217;s reform of day centres for the learning disabled. I preface that by saying that local authorities of all political persuasions have not always got that right. This is not a party-political attack; it is me representing constituents whom I defend and whose interests have not been taken account of.</p><p>Recommendation 5 in &#8220;The keys to life&#8221; is:</p><p>&#8220;That in preparation for the legal duties imposed by the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013, local authorities and their NHS partners should work with private, voluntary and third sector agencies to ensure that people with learning disabilities have access to a creative variety of providers and supports and are assisted to think creatively about how outcomes can be met and what assistance they may need to develop control.&#8221;</p><p>I emphasise that it is about</p><p>&#8220;what assistance they may need to develop control.&#8221;</p><p>I ask members to indulge me, because I also will consider recommendation 27, which is:</p><p>&#8220;That by June 2018 the Scottish Government in partnership with local authorities, the Third Sector and people with learning disabilities and carers review and further develop day opportunities&#8221;.</p><p>I have missed out the second part of that recommendation because of time constraints, but I emphasise that the recommendation says that</p><p>&#8220;people with learning disabilities and carers&#8221;</p><p>should get to</p><p>&#8220;review and further develop day opportunities&#8221;.</p><p>In other words, as the Learning Disability Alliance Scotland puts it, the recommendations</p><p>&#8220;could have been strengthened from the start by re-emphasising the phrase &#8216;Nothing About Us, Without Us&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>in terms of the learning disabled.</p><p>It is in the light of those good principles being included in the new strategy and their having been a thread running through previous strategies that I look at Glasgow City Council&#8217;s approach. The council developed a plan to close three day centres for adults with learning disabilities. It did not consult them, but instead presented the closures as a fait accompli and consulted on the alternatives after the centres were closed. That is not about control; is about marginalisation of some of the most vulnerable people in society. It should not be allowed.</p><p>I stress again that carers and adults with learning disabilities in Glasgow have said that they are open to reforming day-centre provision and general learning disability provision within the city, but the council should speak to them. There should be a two-year moratorium on closures in order that they can engage positively with Glasgow City Council to map out the best service provision and support for adults with learning disabilities in the city.</p><p>To what do adults with learning disabilities have recourse when councils get it wrong? Councils have statutory duties in terms of consultation if they decide to consult. However, when they get it spectacularly wrong, as they have done in Glasgow&#8212;and, sometimes, elsewhere; it is not only about Glasgow&#8212;to what can those most vulnerable people whom I seek to represent have recourse?</p><p>There is a fantastic 10-year strategy in front of us, but we should also be mindful of the gaps that still exist and the need to represent the most vulnerable people in our constituencies.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Learning Disabilities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

A couple of weeks ago, I spoke to some refugees in a Kurdistan refugee camp. From that experience, I am aware of the dire need they have and how much they appreciate any support and any amount of money from anywhere in the world. I am proud to be part of a Parliament that does what it can, with limited resources, to make international humanitarian contributions.</p><p>Unfortunately, I must contrast the Government&#8217;s approach with Jackie Baillie&#8217;s tasteless comments on nationality. I want to give her comments no further credence, so I make the point only for the record. This Government bases its policies and position not only on what is best for all the people of Scotland, no matter where they come from, but in the interests of all humanitarian interventions across the world in order to meet our international obligations. The approach is not about nationality; it is about the human condition and helping everyone.</p><p>Many Labour speakers chose to ignore the legislative programme. Instead, they sought to indulge in negative speeches that did little to comment on or scrutinise the programme. Not for the first time in the chamber, it will take an SNP MSP to scrutinise the Government&#8217;s legislative programme. The Labour Party needs to be mindful of being fit for opposition, never mind being fit for government.</p><p>In doing my bit for scrutiny, I will talk about the bankruptcy consolidation bill. I ask colleagues to look closely at the bill. The bill could be vital in improving debt solutions for some of the most vulnerable people. The bill will build on the good legislation in the previous session&#8212;the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Act 2010&#8212;that I helped to scrutinise at committee stage.</p><p>I want to comment in detail on a problem that still exists, and I ask for the chamber&#8217;s indulgence in doing so. There are three core debt solutions for those who have no realistic hope of finding a way out of their personal debt. Those solutions are bankruptcy via a sequestration or the low-income low-asset route, the debt arrangement scheme and protected trust deeds. There may be others, but those are the three core routes that I will focus on.</p><p>Which debt solution is appropriate will, of course, depend on individual circumstances. For example, home owners with substantial debt might benefit from a protected trust deed, which could protect their family home from repossession and enable them to achieve a workable debt solution. This Government brought in the relevant legislation. Other people&#8212;non-home owners with a certain level of debt&#8212;might be best served by the low-income, low-assets route to bankruptcy. It is evident that it would be wholly inappropriate to offer a protected trust deed to someone who would clearly benefit from the LILA route.</p><p>I believe that protected trust deeds are being offered irresponsibly to vulnerable tenants in Scotland. Protected trust deeds can lead to debt repayment schemes that cost tenants many thousands of pounds and take them several years to pay, and which leave them struggling financially. I put it on record that there will be many good advisers in the marketplace, but some of those who provide advice on protected trust deeds might not give the best, or clear, advice. Such advisers get finders&#8217; fees of more than &#163;1,500 to put people through the protected trust deed process, which they may do inappropriately. I hope that the Scottish Government will use the proposed bankruptcy consolidation bill to regulate debt advice in that area and to ensure that any debt advisers who offer such flawed advice are driven out of the sector. Such inappropriate advice might be offered as a result of incompetence, but it might also be offered by cowboys in the marketplace, whom we should drive out. The Parliament has the regulatory powers to do that.</p><p>Debt advisers who offer other debt solutions have to be registered with the Scottish Government&#8217;s Accountant in Bankruptcy. We could stipulate that those who offer advice on protected trust deeds also have to be registered with the Accountant in Bankruptcy and that, if they did not fulfil their functions properly, they would no longer be registered with the AIB. That is just one way of improving people&#8217;s situation.</p><p>In the time that I have left&#8212;with the Presiding Officer&#8217;s indulgence&#8212;I would like to refer briefly to two other aspects of the legislative programme. I had hoped that people would come forward with ideas for measures to improve the quality of housing that could be included in the proposed housing bill instead of sniping from the sidelines. I would like to offer one thought on how we can improve the quality of housing in Scotland. We must go a lot further in the private housing sector. We must find ways of rewarding good registered private landlords&#8212;we should incentivise them to improve their stock, where we can&#8212;and of clamping down further on the cowboys. I also think that we must do more to put an obligation on landlords in the private rented sector as far as electrical safety is concerned.</p><p>Finally&#8212;do I have time, Presiding Officer?</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695490", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the announcement of additional cash from the Scottish Government to mitigate some of the terrible refugee problems in Syria.

I also welcome the fact that it will be a draft strategy, which will give all interested stakeholders the opportunity to work constructively to develop the strategy in a collegiate way. That is the right way in which to proceed.</p><p>We all want to ensure that the potential legacy from Glasgow&#8217;s Commonwealth games is maximised, as it should significantly increase youngsters&#8217; interest in getting involved in sport. However, just as significant, as the motion states, we want to create a lifelong habit of being active. It is not just about getting young people active; it is about keeping them active. If I have time later, I will say more about that.</p><p>Undoubtedly, investment in sporting infrastructure and funds for specific initiatives to support schools and sports clubs to get many more young people active are crucial. I will note one or two of the investment priorities alongside community sport hubs, which deliver a significant cash saving to many clubs that work together. The &#163;7.4 million capital spending budget to transform local sports facilities throughout Scotland is money that local clubs can access, and the &#163;10 million legacy 2014 active places fund has already awarded cash to 24 community projects. Those are two examples of funding being leveraged in.</p><p>I want to talk about how we should direct future investment. We need a full audit to determine where there are lower levels of sporting participation among young people. Just as important is how we tackle the problem that exists. Is it an issue around volunteers or the range of sports clubs and sporting opportunities that are available? Is it a lack of access to qualified coaches? Is it a facilities issue? Is it to do with the cost of access? Is it down to the fact that there is a weak sporting culture in some areas? Those are potential barriers to participation in sport, and we must have that information before we can direct funds to tackling the issues through the opportunities provided by the Commonwealth games.</p><p>We need a baseline against which to measure any future success in terms of sporting participation and, crucially, to inform future investment. As part of that baseline to inform future investment, we should consider how we can prioritise investment in areas of particular deprivation and areas with particularly poor health outcomes. Unfortunately, those are often the same areas, but those are two clear criteria for the direction of funding to get young people more physically active.</p><p>There have been some really good signs. For example, there has been an investment of &#163;2.2 million in developing a paddlesports centre at Pinkston in Glasgow, with &#163;1 million coming from the Scottish Government. That crucial initiative is driving regeneration in a deprived area. Just as important, a network of youth clubs in the area are now forming their own canoe club to get physically active. Those are opportunities that would not otherwise be available to the people of Maryhill, Springburn and beyond. I am delighted by the joint work that Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government are doing on the bid to host the youth Olympics in north Glasgow. We will see 400 new social rented houses delivered in that part of the city because of the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment, irrespective of whether the youth Olympics bid is successful. We all want the bid to be successful, but it is important that that investment is leveraged in irrespective of that.</p><p>I will say a little bit about the cost of accessing sports facilities. I recently met the football club North Kelvin United, which told me that it was trying to keep costs as low as possible. However, even if the club charges only &#163;3 or &#163;4 a week for young people, the cost for a family with two young boys to get them actively involved in sport can add up to &#163;10 a week if they are bought a can of juice as well, and a lot of families on benefits do not have that money. We must think carefully about that. I give credit to that club because, for the first time, it is launching a girls&#8217; football team. We all want young girls to get more physically active.</p><p>We need to consider how we support success in deprived communities, where there are examples of sports clubs that are doing well, and how we help them. It is incumbent on me to mention the formidable Alex Richardson, from the gladiators weightlifting project, who gave quite dramatic evidence to the Health and Sport Committee. He has informed me that, in the recent championships in Austria, young kids from the east end of Glasgow won two gold, four silver, and four bronze medals and that others were highly placed. He pointed out that, should the 2018 youth Olympics bid be successful, many of those young people will qualify for it. However, those young people should be taking part in the 2018 youth Olympics irrespective of where it is held. Therefore, my plea is that sportscotland, the Scottish Government and others work strategically to ensure that young people who could be sporting icons in their local communities can excel at the highest level. In gladiators, we perhaps have an example of how that could be done.</p><p>My final point concerns the oldies. We want young people to get physically active, but they eventually get old. I therefore suggest that Glasgow should put in a bid for the 2021 world masters games for the over-35s. Young people will&#8212;we hope&#8212;reach 35 at some point in their lives, so I hope that the minister will back that bid. I have written to Glasgow City Council about that, too&#8212;I have asked that it sees those games as part of the legacy to keep people physically active throughout their lives&#8212;so that we can work in partnership to deliver for the city and for Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693450", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the forthcoming Scottish Government strategy on youth sport.

I do not understand how he managed to bring independence into a consensual debate like this; that was a complete non sequitur and a bit insulting to the substance of the debate. It might be out of character, but there we are.</p><p>As other members have done, I pay tribute to Susan Archibald and her petition, and to all those who are involved in the wider campaign to improve the situation for those who live with chronic pain. I have not followed the issue particularly closely, so today&#8217;s debate has given me the opportunity to find out more. Having said that, a number of individual constituents have made representations to me in the past on chronic pain issues. Indeed, I am sure that we all have, as I have, a family member who lives with chronic pain, so we can all see the social and emotional consequences of it as much as the medical consequences.</p><p>I welcome the progress that has been made with regard to chronic pain. In doing so, I note the concerns of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on chronic pain, which supplied a briefing for this afternoon&#8217;s debate, and those of the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland. Those groups have raised concerns about the pace of implementation of recommendations that started as early as 2007 with &#8220;Getting to GRIPS with Chronic Pain in Scotland&#8221;, and about the progress that has been made by each of the 14 health boards. I believe that progress has been made, but we must draw attention to the fact that concerns have been raised about that progress.</p><p>Of course, it is right for passionate and committed campaigners to be in a hurry for quick progress to be made on chronic pain management&#8212;that is the role of doughty campaigners, for which I pay tribute to them. Health boards and the Government must take a planned approach to developing new or improved services. The important date for many will be April 2014, by which time each health board will need to have in place a chronic pain service delivery plan.</p><p>Since 2009, we have had a national lead clinician whose job it is to spearhead and champion the development of pain management services. A national chronic pain steering group has been developed, as well as a Scottish service model for chronic pain. I would welcome information from the Scottish Government on the degree of preparedness for the April 2014 deadline. Many people see that date as an end point for having a comprehensive system in place to tackle chronic pain, rather than a starting point. More information on the preparedness of each health board would be welcome.</p><p>There is a new set of SIGN guidelines that should underpin any managed clinical network and how it will work. I note that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde now has a managed clinical network for the management of chronic pain.</p><p>I am interested to know how the care pathways will work for those who live with chronic pain. How will sufferers seek support? The documentation may be available on file and briefings may have been provided to MSPs, but what will be the reality for those who live with chronic pain?</p><p>I would welcome more information on how the Scottish Government will ensure a consistent approach in the quality of service that is provided across all health boards. However, although I mention the need for a consistent approach, I accept that there is a need for localised delivery models and that is what I want to concentrate much of my speech on.</p><p>One of the organisations that I work with in Maryhill is Revive MS Support&#8212;multiple sclerosis is a significant cause of chronic pain for many&#8212;which provides services such as physiotherapy, aromatherapy, reflexology, counselling, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and speech and language therapy, including swallowing and cognitive advice. I could cite many more examples of the services that Revive MS Support provides, but the important point is that the organisation provides an holistic approach to help those living with chronic pain, such as MS sufferers and their families, by supporting them in the community.</p><p>Revive MS Support is based in the north of Glasgow, but it also does outreach work in Paisley, Douglas, Hamilton, Glasgow&#8217;s south side and beyond. Therefore, as others have said, in looking at the network of support that is available for those living with chronic pain, it is important that we consider the support that can be provided by the third sector or voluntary sector.</p><p>I want to put on record the words of a lady called Jenny Wilson Best, who is an ambassador for Revive MS Support. She said:</p><p>&#8220;REVIVE offer many different therapies but for me it was the &#8216;Fatigue Management Group&#8217; that allowed me to find myself again.

Clearly, he has a knack of getting people and organisations with similar interests and passions together to achieve change. That fact that he has got me&#8212;an unreconstructed city boy who, in my earlier years, did not pay much attention to nature&#8212;speaking in the debate shows the strength of the idea of a national tree. I will say more about that later.</p><p>Rod Campbell talked about the importance of symbols. As a multinational state, the symbols of the United Kingdom&#8217;s constituent countries tend to be recognised by general public agreement, rather than in any official way. The example of the national anthem is an obvious one. &#8220;Flower of Scotland&#8221; is widely recognised as Scotland&#8217;s national anthem, although officially we share&#8212;for the moment&#8212;&#8220;God Save the Queen&#8221; with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. England and United Kingdom also share a national tree&#8212;the pedunculate oak, which is more commonly known as the royal oak.</p><p>I am one of the MSPs who have made representations on behalf of Mr Hamilton to Paul Wheelhouse, the Minister for Environment and Climate Change. I am sure that we will hear from him shortly on how he wants to progress the matter. Although there is no formal mechanism in place for designating an official national tree, that is not a reason not to do it. It can be done and it should be done, and with willingness it will be done.</p><p>The process to date has been constructive. It has certainly got people thinking about our natural world, and appreciating the wonderful wildlife and scenery of Scotland, which are two of our most internationally recognised assets. At times, some of us&#8212;as I said at the start of the debate, that includes me&#8212;can easily take that for granted.</p><p>Joan McAlpine mentioned the boost to our timber industry that having a national tree would bring, and others have said that it will reinforce Scotland the brand. I think that the process by which we choose a national tree is just as important as the tree that we choose, so I would like to say a little about that.</p><p>As we have heard already, the Woodland Trust conducted a poll about what tree Scots would go for; two thirds went for the Scots pine, with the rowan coming second. I understand that the winner got 414 votes. I commend the Woodland Trust for that initiative, but I think that we will be talking about thousands of votes when we take the debate forward nationally on a structured and engaged level. That is the key bit that I would like to talk about. After we eventually decide on what our national tree will be, why not reaffirm that, say, every 10 years and let the people decide whether they wish to stay with the Scots pine, which seems to be the favourite, or whether they wish to replace that? In the time that I have left I want to talk about that process.</p><p>I would like to see our schoolchildren, for example, deciding what they prefer. Would they prefer the Scots pine, or would they think that perhaps it should be the birch, because the birch covers twice the area of Scotland that the Scots pine covers?</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Tree"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Joan McAlpine on securing the debate.

I am pleased that there are now fines of up to &#163;1&#160;million, but fines are to be capped at 1 per cent of turnover. For local and regional titles the impact of fines, if not applied proportionately, could be greater. I do not see that as being an excuse for any local or regional title that deserves a fine, because practice should be of the highest standard, but we must ensure that any system of fines following arbitration is not only consistent, but proportionate.</p><p>I smiled throughout the chat about incentives. I agree with incentives, but I have never in my life seen a carrot that looks so much like a stick. It is not really an incentive to say that we will let a newspaper publish public information notices if it signs up to the voluntary regulatory system and that we will not ask the courts to take into account who pays the legal expenses, although we might if it does not sign up to that system. We must be honest and say that that is as much a stick as a carrot; it is to compel the sector as much as it is to incentivise it. I think that it is the right thing to do, but we should not pretend that it is an incentive.</p><p>On public information notices, I wonder how much local and regional titles, compared with national titles, rely on that income. Perhaps we might look at whether public information notices could include advertising for appointments to various public sector bodies, higher education establishments and that kind of thing.

As we have heard, it estimates that &#163;1.6 billion will be lost to many of the most vulnerable Scots each year as a result of the reforms. People in every local authority area will suffer, but my constituents in Glasgow will suffer more than most. In absolute terms and in per capita terms, Glasgow will be hit more than any other area. The reforms are a brutal attack by the UK Government on the very people whom all Governments have a duty to support where they can.</p><p>My constituents ask me how the Scottish Government and Parliament can protect them from that attack and what we can do to help. The bedroom tax features prominently in my constituents&#8217; list of concerns, but they mention a variety of other changes, including the abolition of disability living allowance and move to personal independence payments and the reform to incapacity benefit. Those two actions alone will affect about 200,000 households and will, if combined, take up to &#163;6,500 away from individual households across Scotland. Again, those changes will impact more on my constituents than on people anywhere else in Scotland.</p><p>Last night, I attended an initial meeting to establish the greater Maryhill food bank in the north of Glasgow, which aims to provide support for families who are in financial and food crisis and who have only three days&#8217; worth of non-perishable food provisions in their home and no way to get additional food. That is a response to current real hunger in Maryhill. The initiative was inspired by local police as the key stakeholders. They do not want to spend their time seeking to prosecute vulnerable individuals who commit crime because of poverty; they want to chase real criminals.</p><p>Last night, I heard a story about a police van driving round Maryhill with a number of police officers inside. They saw a young guy running out of the Lidl supermarket being chased by a security officer. They were heading to an unrelated incident, but they pulled up and cornered the guy, who ran into a garden and was found under a bush. He had stolen a bar of chocolate. That was not petty pilfering&#8212;he had not eaten for a number of days. The local community police shared that story with us at the greater Maryhill food bank meeting last night.</p><p>That cannot be right, but the situation will get a lot worse as the reform continues. I fully accept that such cases are a tiny minority at present, but they will not remain so for long if we do not do something about the issue. I am therefore delighted that housing associations, churches, charities, community councils, youth groups and others are coming together to address the situation. They should not have to address it, because that is up to the state but, because of their community spirit and solidarity, they are compelled to do what they can to provide support.</p><p>I have constituents who, right now, are being asked to move out of their homes and communities so that their housing benefit will meet their rent. Local links are being destroyed, support networks are being broken, childcare provision is being wrecked and lives are being placed in turmoil. Of course, they can move only if another property is available and, often, it is not. In many cases, even when a property is available, families do not for understandable reasons feel able to move.</p><p>In Glasgow, the SNP opposition group is seeking to get the Labour-run council to increase the housing benefit discretionary fund by the maximum permitted under the legislation, which is by two and a half times. The shortfall in housing benefit in Glasgow will be about &#163;10 million per annum, while the discretionary fund from the UK is less than &#163;3 million. I hope that the council will listen to those constructive representations from the SNP and I urge the council to increase the discretionary fund by the maximum allowed, if it can do so.</p><p>That would be a form of mitigation. We have heard about a number of other forms of mitigation by the Scottish Government, such as the &#163;9 million for the welfare fund; the &#163;40 million, with our local authority partners, to deal with the council tax benefit cut; and the funding for money advice services. However, the changes to council tax benefit are a &#163;50 million per annum cut from Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable people, out of a total cut to those people of &#163;1.6 billion.</p><p>Can we get real? Those who call for us to plug every gap from the UK Government&#8217;s attacks on our most vulnerable people are deceiving themselves and the people of Scotland. Only giving this Parliament powers over tax and benefits with full independence will ever protect Scotland&#8217;s most vulnerable people.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the members of the Welfare Reform Committee for the on-going scrutiny that they provide.

Just as Labour members have said that they are keen to reintroduce prescription charges, they have said that they want to pick away at the universal concessionary travel scheme and take bus passes off some over-60s, although they will not say whom. For many, the scheme is a lifeline in relation to not only balancing household budgets but preventing social isolation. What about the well-off pensioner? The argument has been made many times in the chamber that they should not get a free bus pass, but have pensioners not paid taxes throughout their lives? Also, any pensioner who does not use the bus pass will not cost the state a penny&#8212;that is important as well. I do not want to live in a society in which the absolute poorest get free medicine at the point of need but no one else does. I do not want to live in a society that divides our pensioners into the haves and the have-nots. That is corrosive and, ultimately, it undermines the social provision of services.</p><p>That is the real point that I want members to take from my speech. I do not want people in Scotland to pay taxes to the state and get little in return, as they might see it. Universal service provision benefits all in society and is a social contract between Government and communities. I say to Mr Rennie that that is not a new concept. The idea of no taxation without representation was not invented by the SNP, but there we are&#8212;we will take credit for that as well, if he wants. If we really want a society in which Scottish people, by and large, feel that it is a duty to pay tax for service provision not just for the weakest in society but for everyone, we must preserve certain core universal services that are paid for by all via general taxation.

She was the first white woman to cross the Kalahari desert, and she did so while she was pregnant. That is no mean feat in itself. There is the active role that she played herself, not just the support that she offered to David Livingstone. She is an inspiration to many women. Often in history, the roles of great men overshadow the significant contributions of remarkable women. As has been said, we have to tease out Mary Moffat&#8217;s role to women today. There are some sacrifices that they should simply not have to make as they go forward in life. I think that many of the young girls from St Blane&#8217;s primary school who are here will take that on board. It is not an either/or question when somebody is committing to a relationship or ploughing their way in the world. People should be able to do both.</p><p>We can take the fact that David Livingstone came from a humble background and went to university as a strong theme. We all think that Scotland&#8217;s steadfast commitment to free education for all is vital.

[Applause.] I hope that I said that we are proud of Scotland&#8217;s Kurds, that their contribution to our society is valued by our nation, and that Scotland will never forget the horrific events at Halabja and the brutal Anfal campaign that brought many Kurds to our shores.</p><p>The debate is an opportunity to pay tribute to them and to thank them for all that they do for Scotland. It is also important that we stand in solidarity with Scotland&#8217;s Kurds and recognise the pain and suffering that led many of them and their families to come to Scotland in the first place. As it is now 25 years since the horrors of Halabja and the Anfal campaign, it is both right and timely for Scotland to show solidarity with them.</p><p>We must all do what we can to prevent such genocide and such acts against humanity from ever happening again. For me, never forgetting those events and recognising them as genocide are fundamental to ensuring that that is the case. Two other motions before the Scottish Parliament seek to do likewise.</p><p>The genocide has been recognised. In 2005, the International Court of Justice in The Hague recognised it and, in 2007, it again said at an appeal that there had been genocidal intent. Between 2007 and 2010, the Supreme Court of Iraq ruled that the 1988 attacks on the Kurdish population constituted genocide. That they were genocide has been acknowledged by members of the Swedish, Norwegian and Westminster Parliaments.</p><p>On 16 March 1988, indiscriminate rocket, phosphorus and napalm attacks fell upon Halabja. Chemical weapons that are likely to have included mustard gas, various nerve agents and cyanide were carried by Iraqi MiG and Mirage fighters. Up to 5,000 Kurds died and 10,000 were injured. Most were women and children. Many died instantly. Others did not&#8212;they died painfully from their injuries, in some cases much, much later. No one can ever quantify the physical pain and mental anguish of those who survived, but other long-term effects can be quantified, such as higher probabilities of miscarriage, infertility, birth defects, blood malignancies and cancer.</p><p>Al-Anfal in 1988 was part of wider attacks that were carried out on Kurds between March 1987 and April 1989. During that two-year period, Kurds were forced to endure great pain. That evil campaign was led by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s first cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, who was notoriously known as Chemical Ali. The scale of the horror was massive. Thousands of Kurdish villages&#8212;perhaps 90 per cent of all Kurdish villages in Iraq&#8212;were destroyed. Official figures document that 100,000 persons disappeared in 1988 alone, although some Kurdish sources claim that the figure could be as high as 182,000. Those who were abducted or arrested were often sent to concentration camps, where women and children were separated from men of military age. The elderly and infirm were also separated from others.</p><p>Many Kurds across the world&#8212;many of whom were displaced because of these very events&#8212;live with the memory of those atrocities. Younger Kurds in Glasgow and elsewhere have heard stories about the events, and it is vital that the younger generation grows up with the knowledge and understanding of the previous generation&#8217;s suffering. I know that many of them have done so. However, it is not only Kurds who should remember such terrible events, but all of us.</p><p>Before today&#8217;s debate, Fergus Ewing MSP told me about his work with Kurds in Glasgow in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He recalls attending a ceremony in Queens park&#8212;which is one of Glasgow&#8217;s large parks&#8212;where a tree was planted by Kurdish families in remembrance of those whose lives were lost at Halabja. That small gesture is a powerful symbol of solidarity with Kurds not only in Glasgow but everywhere.</p><p>I am sure that there have been similar events across Scotland over the years in remembrance of Halabja and Anfal. Perhaps the Scottish Government will consider how to support and co-ordinate such activities in the future.</p><p>I said that such genocide must never be allowed to happen again. Looking at the world, we see how troubled it can be. Remembering the history of pain and suffering is crucial to that, but so is how people respond. Peace and mutual respect are vital ingredients in that response, too. For Glasgow and Scotland, that should be about celebrating our Kurdish communities&#8212;not only the Kurdish doctors, lawyers and engineers who contribute to our society, but the asylum seekers and refugees who still need much support and assistance.</p><p>I began by mentioning Shakha Sattar. His response to the atrocities when he came to Scotland as a boy was to grow up steadfast in the belief that helping his community in Glasgow was how he could play his part in ensuring a positive legacy from such terrible crimes. It is a privilege to work with him and others on that task.</p><p>Scotland is a more rich and vibrant place because of the contribution that many new Scots have made to our nation. Glasgow&#8217;s Kurds are a powerful part of that mix.</p><p>I note that today we commemorate with sadness the events of Halabja and Anfal. It is crucial that we also celebrate the contribution that Glasgow&#8217;s and Scotland&#8217;s Kurds have made to our nation.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687810", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Kurdish Contribution to Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by welcoming my Kurdish constituents from Glasgow&#8212;and, in particular, a young man, Mr Shakha Sattar&#8212;who inspired me to secure this debate in Scotland&#8217;s national Parliament.

As Mr Hepburn said, that figure is estimated to be about 17 per cent today, so dramatically fewer children are living in poverty. When the figures are calculated in the same way, I notice that the UK figure is 18 per cent.</p><p>I draw that comparison for a reason. I am not quibbling over a percentage point, but I raise the idea of competition across the UK and beyond on tackling child poverty. Let us have competition&#8212;absolutely&#8212;because the only winners when we tackle child poverty, anywhere in the UK or in the world, will be the children. Let us have some good old competition to raise the bar for life expectancy and the quality of life that children in Scotland and beyond experience.</p><p>I will focus for a bit on the UK context, because we cannot and never will be able to deal with Scotland in isolation, whether we are independent or otherwise. We must look at welfare reform. It has been said that 50,000 children face being plunged into poverty because of the UK Tory Government&#8217;s welfare reform proposals. In the process, &#163;2.5 billion will be taken from Scottish households&#8212;households that often do not have enough money currently, never mind after further cuts from the UK Government.

A Labour spokesperson at the UK level is also not listening now on the bedroom tax. I heard Mr Chisholm talking about a Twitter account called LabourNoBedTax. Perhaps that should be LabourNoConsistencyOrHonestyOnTheBedroomTax. Perhaps Labour should change its Twitter account.</p><p>Such situations drive me towards thinking that it is not a matter of waiting for independence, but that only independence can guarantee that the Scottish people and Scottish families see the future that we need for our children.

That was what Jackie Baillie put forward in that debate. We need a greater role for the third sector, not the dominance of local government.

This is fast becoming Malawi March in the Parliament, with the state visit by President Joyce Banda next week and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association reception the week after that. In addition, James Kelly, who is present this evening, will be having a debate on the theme later this month.</p><p>Other than the legacy of David Livingstone, the inspiration for having the debate was Councillor Bert Thomson, the councillor for Blantyre, who told me about his fondness for the connection that the area he represents has with David Livingstone, and about his experiences as a boy&#8212;which I am sure were not that long ago&#8212;in relation to the work carried out. Also, Jim Hume has a strong family connection with David Livingstone, and a number of members who are in the chamber have strong connections with Malawi and have done a lot of work on that. I pay tribute to them for that.</p><p>By way of introduction, I would like to reflect on Scotland&#8217;s special relationship with Malawi. That is the most enduring legacy of Dr Livingstone, who was undoubtedly one of the most renowned Scots of the 19th century and is surely Blantyre&#8217;s most famous son. Unlike his devout, Sunday school teaching father, Livingstone was convinced of the compatibility of religion and science and he hoped to use one to advance the other, although his emphasis was always more on exploration and humanitarian concerns than on straight missionary work.</p><p>It was those humanitarian concerns that led Kenneth Kaunda, the first President of Zambia, to describe Livingstone as Africa&#8217;s first freedom fighter. A staunch opponent of slavery, Livingstone strongly believed that promoting enterprise and commerce would help to bring social justice, self-government and light to what was unfortunately still described in Europe as the dark continent.</p><p>Dr Livingstone&#8217;s navigation of the Zambezi on one such expedition in the 1870s took him to what is now known as Malawi. The visit opened up the interior of the sub-Saharan region to European trade and watered the seeds that have flowered into the modern nation of Malawi. The trade settlement that Livingstone established has since grown into the country&#8217;s commercial capital, and his influence is made plain in the city&#8217;s name, Blantyre.</p><p>Although Malawi became independent in 1964, it has retained its close links with the United Kingdom and Scotland in particular. Those links were fostered by Jack McConnell when he was First Minister in what was the devolved Scottish Administration&#8217;s first high-profile international engagement, and I think that the move represented a coming of age for the Parliament and the then Executive. The co-operation agreement that was signed in 2005 by the Scottish and Malawian Administrations codifies the role of the Scottish Government in international development in Malawi in the areas of health, education, the economy and governance. Under the agreement, the Scottish Government ring fences a minimum of &#163;3 million from its international development fund for projects in Malawi. However, I am delighted to say that since 2010 the average has been about &#163;4.5 million per year.</p><p>The bicentenary offers a chance to build on that fantastic legacy. Throughout the year, a number of grass-roots and Scottish Government-supported activities are being held both here and in Africa to mark the anniversary. Perhaps most significantly, Zambia, which is arguably the country after Malawi that has been most influenced by Livingstone, will host the Livingstone 2013 festival, which will include an exchange programme with Scotland for medical students at Zambia&#8217;s Livingstone hospital. The programme will allow the countries to share expertise in what are, given Livingstone&#8217;s background, particularly appropriate fields.</p><p>The David Livingstone bicentenary scholarship programme, which I mention in my motion, is a central part of that legacy. In my research for this debate, I was surprised to find that Malawi has the lowest rate of university enrolment in the world; only 51 in 100,000 Malawians are in higher education and most of them are in liberal arts courses. Although that is in many ways a positive sign and suggests an improvement in standards of living and the emergence of a middle class, Malawian universities need to produce graduates with the skills to contribute directly to the country&#8217;s economic and social development and this &#163;100,000 programme, which is funded by the Scottish Government and managed by the Scotland Malawi Partnership, will help to support up to 50 gifted but underprivileged Malawians through a masters degree.</p><p>Although the scholarship is a one-off, it should, if done correctly, have benefits that endure long after the bicentenary year. To achieve that&#8212;and I understand that the partnership is still fleshing out the details of this&#8212;it has suggested that one of the criteria for the awarding of the grant be that applicants contribute via their studies to the wider community, perhaps by teaching in a school or working in the development sector. In that way, the investment will have a knock-on effect beyond the students who will benefit directly.</p><p>The National Trust for Scotland&#8217;s David Livingstone centre, which is based in Livingstone&#8217;s childhood home in Blantyre, is at the heart of the bicentenary celebrations, and I am pleased to welcome some of the centre&#8217;s staff to the chamber. This year, more than 80 years after its establishment, it has been awarded official museum accreditation, and I know that the centre hopes that another legacy of the bicentenary will be a major repair and refurbishment programme for its buildings.</p><p>Next week, on the bicentenary itself, children from local Blantyre primary schools will bury at the centre a time capsule containing a mixture of historic materials, some of which have been provided by a primary school in Malawi. Later that day, the centre will unveil one of Livingstone&#8217;s newly discovered diaries. I pay special tribute to the centre for this activity because I think that teaching children about and encouraging them to participate in Livingstone&#8217;s legacy is a wonderful way of ensuring that the special links between Scotland and Malawi remain strong into the next generation and&#8212;I hope&#8212;for centuries to come.</p><p>As a Glasgow MSP, I feel it a privilege that boundaries were changed to bring Blantyre into the Glasgow region. It enriches the geographical area that I represent in the same way that David Livingstone&#8217;s legacy enriches Scotland, Malawi and, indeed, the world. I am sure that when we celebrate David Livingstone&#8217;s 400th birthday in 200 years&#8217; time, those bonds will be stronger than ever.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686494", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: David Livingstone Bicentenary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to host this debate on the legacy of David Livingstone, who would have been 200 next Tuesday.

Committees have served the Parliament well in taking things forward in conjunction with the Government.</p><p>I am delighted to speak in a debate that ain&#8217;t the debate that we had yesterday. Many members who are here took part in yesterday&#8217;s debate, which did not cover the Parliament in glory&#8212;I see that Jackie Baillie is muttering, and perhaps we should both reflect on the tone of that debate. The tone of today&#8217;s debate is much better and the Parliament is the better served for that.</p><p>There are, however, strong links between the two debates. Why are accident and emergency units getting busier? Why do more people need a hospital procedure? Part of the answer is about demographic change, but it is also about getting things right in the community, through preventative spend. There are things that can be done quite easily in communities to reduce slips, trips and falls among older people, for example, which would drastically reduce the number of people who turn up at A and E or who need a hospital stay. We need to integrate and co-ordinate strategy for matters such as care at home and prevention work, to reduce presentations to hospital and ensure that people can be treated in the community.</p><p>We also need appropriate discharges from hospital. I do not like to use the terms &#8220;delayed discharge&#8221; or &#8220;bed blocking&#8221;, because I do not want discharges to be quick or slow. I want people to be discharged from hospital at a time that suits their care and medical needs&#8212;their discharge should be neither fast nor slow, but appropriate. We all need to reflect on that.</p><p>That approach needs a single accountable officer, so that the buck cannot be passed on getting the strategy right, and there have to be clear lines of accountability.

The Committee therefore welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposal for a clear line of accountability to rest with a single individual for each health and social care partnership. The Committee also considers it essential that the governance arrangements for each local partnership should retain strong links with local government through representation of councillors on partnership boards.&#8221;</p><p>Local authorities should have a clear core role, but not a dominant one. Of course, local authorities are democratically elected bodies, but I say gently to some of my Labour colleagues that saying, &#8220;Just leave it to the cooncil,&#8221; results in a shiver of fear running through Glaswegians, given what is happening in Glasgow, particularly regarding protecting the most vulnerable. Just yesterday, three day care centres were earmarked for closure without there having been any proper consultation with the community. I needed to raise that point; had I not done so, vulnerable people in Glasgow would think that I had betrayed them.</p><p>We have heard a lot about national care standards and Duncan McNeil made some important points. I ask the Labour Party to reflect on the use of expressions such as &#8220;postcode lottery&#8221;. In its report, the committee said that it</p><p>&#8220;welcomes the intention of the Scottish Government to provide flexibility within a legislative framework which will prescribe minimum standards.&#8221;</p><p>We absolutely need core minimum enforceable standards, but we must ensure that minimum standards do not become the extent of our aspirations. We must ensure that local health boards and local authorities can, if they decide, invest more money and go beyond a basic minimum standard. That is my issue with the Labour Party wanting to take local democracy away from the system and leave minimum standards as the only standards that people receive. There is a threat to local democracy in that.</p><p>Taking forward this agenda will need significant service redesign. I agree with Duncan McNeil that we should do that to improve the outcomes for all people in society, irrespective of the demographic challenges and the financial situation. However, those two things are clearly drivers for change.</p><p>The point has been made that when we redesign services, the voluntary and third sector should be seen as an equal partner. There is a fear that if local authorities and health boards come to the table with millions and millions of pounds, the third sector will find itself squeezed out of service redesign and the commissioning process, which often looks at what parties can bring to the table, rather than what they can do for the people most in need in our society.</p><p>I will use some of the time that I have left to mention a couple of excellent projects.

That is the Opposition&#8217;s duty. It is in sorrow rather than in anger that I call into question the motivation behind the Labour motion. I hope that we can unite across party boundaries where possible to support our NHS. However, I believe that the current Labour strategy deliberately seeks only to create conflict. That strategy can serve only to potentially demoralise many hard-working NHS employees and disengage the public, whom we all seek to serve.</p><p>The first sentence in the motion refers to a &#8220;hidden waiting times scandal&#8221;, which, as I shall go on to prove, is clearly a preposterous and demonstrably erroneous statement. When Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government abolished the shameful hidden waiting lists that were inherited from the Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive, waiting lists received the full glare of public scrutiny for the first time since devolution. Let us not forget that up to one third of patients were removed from regular waiting lists altogether and were left languishing on hidden waiting lists, sometimes for many years, without treatment.</p><p>That was the unacceptable situation that the current Government inherited. That previous system treated patients as an irrelevance, and an accounting process was used so that patients on waiting lists simply disappeared, in a fashion of which even David Copperfield would have been rightly proud. Labour must apologise for that if it is ever to start to regain any credibility with the NHS.</p><p>What progress has been made since Labour was kicked out of power in 2007? Under the new ways system that the SNP Government introduced, for the first time all patients were accounted for on waiting lists in a system that was open to public scrutiny. There is now nothing hidden about waiting lists under the Scottish Government. Labour would do better to have a constructive discussion on how we improve matters further.</p><p>The Labour motion notes, wrongly, a supposed &#8220;waiting times scandal&#8221;. I will focus on the period during which Audit Scotland said that there were issues with the recording of data. There were shortcomings and many of the matters that needed to be addressed have either been attended to or are currently being attended to. However, let us consider the waiting time experiences of all patients during the period in question.</p><p>I refer to ISD data, which includes patients who were designated as socially or medically unavailable and who may have had delays as a result. Irrespective of social or medical unavailability, we find that 94.3 per cent of all patients&#8212;including those who had delays&#8212;were treated within 18 weeks. That is a figure to be proud of, but I stress that it is not one to be complacent about.</p><p>Record levels of achievement against waiting time targets is not my definition of a scandal. It is a scandal only in the parallel, alternative universe of the Labour Opposition in the Parliament.</p><p>Audit Scotland did not suggest that there was a lack of progress on waiting time targets. It rightly suggested that there was a need to improve recording of reasons for patient delays. That is what the NHS seeks to address. I am pleased to hear much of the Scottish Government response to date.</p><p>The Labour Party tends to ignore the vast majority of patient experiences. Every negative patient experience that has been put to the chamber today should be taken seriously, but the Labour Party completely ignores the vast majority of patient experiences. It completely ignores the 88 per cent satisfaction rating that the NHS in Scotland has. I stress again that I want to consider how we further engage with the 12 per cent and improve the quality of service to them, but Labour completely ignores the vast majority of people, who are happy with the NHS.</p><p>I will give members one example, because Jackie Baillie gave us many examples. How about the patient from the area that I represent, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Splendid! Many thanks to all at southern General and Glasgow Royal for looking after my 83 year old mother during her operation on Jan 10th. Splendid care from splendid staff in a splendid organisation. No wonder our NHS is the envy of the world.&#8221;</p><p>That is completely ignored by the Labour Party, which puts a cheap tabloid headline ahead of patient care. That is absolutely scandalous.</p><p>I will say something that the Labour Party could do to shine some scrutiny on the matter. At the Public Audit Committee, the Auditor General mentioned a particularly good use of waiting time targets: she said that, when they are not achieved, it identifies a financial or provision gap and Audit Scotland would expect the NHS to act on that. It is in that light that I look at NHS targets for waiting times of four hours in accident and emergency&#8212;I point out that they are considerably better than they were under the Labour Party, although, to be frank, they are still not good enough&#8212;and the &#163;50 million of investment in the unscheduled care action plan to address that.</p><p>Where targets are met, we should be proud of our NHS; where we fall just short, we allocate and reallocate resources to address the fact. That is a quality NHS, well funded by the Government, which the Labour Party would not have supported financially had it got into power and been where we are standing in the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Labour Party motion adds to the growing evidence of that party&#8217;s decision to use the NHS overtly as a political football to seek party advantage, whereas a responsible Opposition would use the Parliament to improve the NHS for the people of Scotland.

I signed his motion, and I had been thinking of putting my name down to speak in the debate, without quite getting around to it until I was contacted by constituents who reminded me how important the issue is to them. That was a reality check and reminded me that some of what we say in the Parliament does not go unheard to the extent that we sometimes think that it does. People sometimes listen to every word of a debate that chimes with them, and the debate about fathers certainly chimed with the constituents who contacted me.</p><p>Constituents wanted me to raise the idea of shared parenting, on which Families Need Fathers has produced a briefing. Let me be clear: I am talking not about fathers and mums each getting 50 per cent of the time, but about dad&#8212;or whoever is the so-called absent parent&#8212;being more than a weekend visitor and being a core part of the family, with a proactive role in the child&#8217;s life that is about more than just taking them out for a day here or an hour there. Many fathers feel that they are denied that role.</p><p>We must consider the whole idea of access to children, which seems to be interpreted restrictively in some cases. People think that if someone is guaranteed access to their child for a couple of hours once a week, that is the maximum time that they are allowed to spend with their child. That is not the case, and I think that Christine Grahame also said that it is not the case in law. I find that attitude worrying.</p><p>We also need to consider the whole idea of custody of children, which comes back to children&#8217;s rights. Children are not assets to be divided up on the breakdown of a marriage. We can miss that point.</p><p>Christine Grahame talked about how the Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Act 2006 seems to have gone unnoticed by many people in the education sector. Why should a dad not attend their kid&#8217;s parents night, whether with mum or not, to find out how the child is doing? Why should they not be an active member of the parent teacher association, if they choose to do that? Why should they not take part in school life? After all, school is a major part of their child&#8217;s life, from which they should not be excluded. We will have to return to the 2006 act and ensure that it can be properly and appropriately implemented. I will be interested to hear the minister&#8217;s views on that.</p><p>As we heard, the issue is not just about guidance for schools and the laws and rights that exist. There is also an issue to do with access to healthcare information and how the national health service treats fathers&#8212;or absent parents, whoever they are. I point out that, in a minority of cases, fathers are sometimes the main custodians, and it is the mums who are seeking access. That does happen. These matters concern absent parents, not specifically fathers.</p><p>We must consider whether or not sheriffs are skilled enough in how they deal with access and custody arrangements and with the rights of fathers and mothers.

I also welcome former service users&#8212;and their family members&#8212;of the Accord Centre in Glasgow&#8217;s east end, which was one of the three centres that Glasgow City Council previously closed.</p><p>In Glasgow, there are seven day centres for adults with learning difficulties. The Summerston, Hinshaw Street and Berryknowes centres have all been targeted for closure. Each of those centres is cherished by the users and those who care for them, as it provides a sense of community, fosters friendship and underpins peer support. The centres also provide vital support to families and carers, many of whom&#8212;if they do not mind my saying so&#8212;are entering old age.</p><p>The closure of the centres means that roughly 320 learning-disabled people will move to alternative day services. The problem is that no one has any idea what that will involve, as no details have been given. The council&#8217;s proposal paper says:</p><p>&#8220;The capacity to use community venues throughout the city is currently severely constrained by the availability of appropriate toileting and changing facilities.&#8221;</p><p>Members can see our concern about whether, even if other facilities were used, they would be appropriate. The situation will come as no surprise to some of the people who relied on the Accord centre before its closure. The people who are here today tell me that they are still waiting for adequate provision to be offered following that closure.</p><p>The Learning Disability Alliance Scotland reports that one Glasgow mother whose daughter used one of the now-closed day centres said:</p><p>&#8220;Now I take Megan to a church hall, where for &#163;5 we can sit from 11 to 3. For lunch she gets a sliced ham and white bread sandwich and a chocolate biscuit but at least it&#8217;s warm and dry. There&#8217;s pens and colouring books to keep her occupied.&#8221;</p><p>If that is the level of ambition for some of Glasgow&#8217;s most vulnerable adults, I urge the city council urgently to reconsider its position.</p><p>The proposals will also affect the 200 adults with the most profound learning difficulties who will be left using the four remaining centres. They are part of a wider community in the day centre network. They have friends with a range of learning difficulties; they thrive in one another&#8217;s company and there is a clear benefit to all. That will be lost, and the danger is that we will marginalise and isolate the most vulnerable in society. I do not believe that that is the council&#8217;s intention, but the plans could well achieve that.</p><p>I will look briefly at the council&#8217;s financial position. The council has recently published plans to cut &#163;70 million from its budget over two years, but I clarify that it does not have a &#163;70 million cash shortfall in its coffers and that it has a &#163;2.3 billion budget. The city has the money to retain the centres, so the closures are a political choice.

More important, the decision fails to consider our learning disabled adults as a community in which individual choice is important but the group&#8217;s needs are also respected.</p><p>The Parliament will be aware that choice is a fundamental principle that is inherent in self-directed support, which empowers service users to extend, terminate or retain services as appropriate. However, the council&#8217;s proposed actions will restrict choice dramatically. Personalisation can involve retaining an existing service, but the plans will not provide for that.</p><p>I do not oppose reform and the families to whom I have spoken do not object to it. However, they have not been included in any meaningful discussions about what a future service might or might not look like. Families and service users feel that the council has frozen them out. Surely any service redesign proposals should place current users and carers at the heart of the consultation process.</p><p>Unfortunately, Glasgow City Council has a dreadful track record in that area, whether in respect of the school estate, the plans for George Square or the most vulnerable people in our society.

Ahead of the games arriving in Glasgow, the Commonwealth baton relay will be a wonderful opportunity and we can do so much with it. A fanfare will surround the baton relay across all Commonwealth countries and a positive message will be sent about what awaits the athletes, their families and tourists when they arrive in Scotland.</p><p>I am delighted that the Commonwealth 2014 team plans to initiate related events for the diaspora of people from Commonwealth countries who are in Scotland. Working with that diaspora in Scotland is vital. We can produce as many glossy brochures as we like that say how wonderful Scotland is, but it will be what the diaspora in Scotland of Pakistanis, Indians, Sri Lankans and Cameroonians&#8212;we could go on and on&#8212;tell sportspersons and tourists from Commonwealth countries about their experiences of living in Scotland that really sells Glasgow&#8217;s and Scotland&#8217;s games to the rest of the Commonwealth. I am delighted that deep and meaningful engagement will take place, as that is vital.</p><p>Linked to that is the &#163;4 million cultural fund that has been announced. I was delighted to hear about the variety of cultural events in Angus that Graeme Dey referred to, which will include work in schools. I am sure that that will be significant. I should plug the organisation of the former MSP Anne McLaughlin&#8212;the African Caribbean centre in Glasgow, which the minister has visited. That is an example of a community hub for a diaspora of people from the Commonwealth who are vibrant and active and who enjoy living in Scotland. We must make the link between people who travel to Scotland and the diaspora in Scotland. The cultural fund provides a wonderful opportunity to develop that.</p><p>Health inequalities have an impact on black and minority ethnic groups, as they do in significant ways on a range of groups in Scotland. Specific needs arise from the mental health issues that many minority ethnic communities face. In looking through my briefings in preparing for the debate, I was delighted to see that the Scottish sport relief programme has started to give out meaningful awards. It is a partnership between sport relief and the Scottish Government, and an additional &#163;1.2 million has recently been put into the pot of cash for it.</p><p>I note that the Glasgow Association for Mental Health recently got &#163;120,000 from that programme for training and advocacy work for black and minority ethnic mental health service users in the area that I represent. On dealing with ethnic and gender inequality, I note that &#163;117,000 was awarded to the Rape Crisis Centre in Glasgow to support women refugees who have experienced rape and that Freedom from Torture Scotland got &#163;120,000 for therapeutic support for women who have experienced torture and who are refugees or asylum seekers. That is a meaningful legacy and work that is taking place in relation to the Commonwealth games that is not just sport related. The games provide an opportunity to do much across society.</p><p>I chair the cross-party group on racial equality in Scotland. At our annual general meeting in October, we were addressed by Paul Zealey of the Glasgow 2014 team. His presentation was impressive and comprehensive, and the BME stakeholders who were present&#8212;of whom I assure members there were many&#8212;unanimously welcomed it. As Hanzala Malik knows, getting unanimous support at a meeting of the cross-party group on racial equality is a pretty tough bar to reach, but the consensus was that things were proceeding well.</p><p>We will seek tangible outcomes in, say, six months&#8217; time and one year&#8217;s time on delivery of Mr Zealey&#8217;s vision. Part of that delivery will involve engaging further with the cross-party group, which I hope will happen at a stakeholder event in Glasgow in the new year, to ensure that black and minority ethnic groups are suitably consulted and engaged with on the games. In our cross-party group, Mr Malik has something to offer in relation to that.</p><p>I will widen out the discussion about volunteers. It is wonderful news that 40,000 people have volunteered to be volunteers, although we need only 15,000. I agree with the minister about keeping the volunteer registrations coming. I am keen that we do not have the usual faces as volunteers. We have a professional class of volunteers in Scotland and across the UK&#8212;sometimes that involves MSPs, too. We must ensure that the people who are least likely to volunteer are the most likely to be given support to volunteer.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by focusing on the race equality and community cohesion opportunities that will be created by the Commonwealth games coming to Glasgow and Scotland in 2014.

Irrespective of where the volunteers come from&#8212;whether they are from Scotland or the rest of the UK&#8212;we should ensure that there is a vibrant ethnic mix. We should ensure that some of the volunteers from the rest of the UK who will come to Glasgow and offer their services, for which we are grateful, come from deprived communities in which people are least likely to volunteer.</p><p>I will make a couple of brief points if I still have time. With regard to the games legacy, we have heard that increased sports participation is already happening due to the success of the London Olympic games. Many young people have presented at sports centres throughout Scotland and the UK, but coaching staff have not necessarily been in place to handle that demand. I am sure that the sports inquiry by the Health and Sport Committee, on which I and Nanette Milne sit, is considering that issue.</p><p>We must ensure that we find a solution so that there are enough coaches in place to meet the demand for increased participation in sport. Some leisure trusts in Scotland&#8212;including Glasgow Life from time to time&#8212;have slightly restricted practices with regard to who they define as a coach to allow that person to use the facilities. Perhaps, in the short term at least, we need to find more innovative ways to get volunteer coaches in to help to meet that demand. Of course, that is no replacement for fully qualified coaches, which would be my first preference.</p><p>I do not care who takes the credit for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth games. I note that Jack McConnell and Steven Purcell, as well as Scotland&#8217;s First Minister Alex Salmond, led the way on the games, along with Glasgow City Council. However, there should not be a bunfight over who gets the credit.

A friend of mine was at the garden lobby reception, so I know that people who have children and other family members with cerebral palsy know about the awareness raising activities that are taking place right now and are grateful for them.</p><p>The number of people with cerebral palsy in Scotland has never been definitively recorded, but Capability Scotland is in the process of establishing a register for that purpose. Currently, it estimates that about 15,000 people in Scotland&#8212;approximately one in every 350 in society&#8212;have cerebral palsy.</p><p>Although cerebral palsy is not directly life-threatening, certain associated conditions, such as epilepsy and respiratory complications, can be. The primary debilitating effect is on movement and reflexes. The Bobath approach is particularly important, as it addresses the issues directly by focusing on improving motor skills, posture and speech, and helping people to live more independently. The therapy that is offered is highly flexible and tailored to the specific needs of the individual.</p><p>The main aim of Bobath therapy is to encourage the child and increase their ability to move and function in as normal a way as possible. Normal movements cannot be achieved if a child stays in a few positions and moves in a limited or disordered way. The intervention of Bobath therapy, which helps to change a child&#8217;s seemingly abnormal postures and movements, can lead to real progress. Bobath involves a transdisciplinary approach that includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy that enable children to participate in daily activities.</p><p>In preparing for the debate, I read Bobath Scotland&#8217;s annual report and found the case of five-year-old Katie, which is a particularly good example of the Bobath approach. Because of underdevelopment in Katie&#8217;s leg and arm muscles, she tended to bottom shuffle around the floor, which led to further muscular problems in her hips. Following just two months of treatment at the Glasgow centre, the problems were alleviated and she was able to pull herself up using furniture. To some people, that might not seem a great deal, but that sort of thing can be revolutionary for families and can improve the quality of life in their homes.</p><p>I was pleased to meet with people from Bobath Scotland at the recent exhibition in Parliament and to sign their petition calling for equal access to Bobath treatment throughout Scotland. I was comfortable with that and relaxed about it. The Glasgow centre provides a world-class service and caters for people from throughout the country. It was established 17 years ago and so far has treated 700 children. Of course, their families have also benefited.</p><p>We have heard much about the provision of Bobath therapy across Scotland. It is right to draw that to the minister&#8217;s attention but, from my discussions with Bobath Scotland in the Parliament, I understand that the issue is not just about Bobath Scotland doing what it does so well as a centre of excellence; it is about skills transfer to teams throughout Scotland to allow allied health professionals in all of Scotland&#8217;s health boards to act appropriately and to provide such a holistic service.</p><p>We cannot and should not take away the independence of health boards to make clinical and care decisions, but we need a co-ordinated approach to ensure that we share best practice and systems across the country, and the minister has a role in ensuring that that happens. That is not just about supporting Bobath Scotland as an organisation but about ensuring that the various allied health professionals have the support and time that they need to care and treat.</p><p>I mentioned that we are not sure how many people in Scotland have cerebral palsy and that Capability Scotland is carrying out an exercise on that. To plan services we have to capture need, and to capture need we have to know the numbers. Therefore, anything that the Government can do to assist Capability Scotland in that work would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>I again thank Patricia Ferguson for bringing the motion to the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679307", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bobath Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As others have done, I thank and pay tribute to Patricia Ferguson for bringing the motion to the chamber and for hosting Bobath Scotland&#8217;s visit to the Parliament ahead of this debate.

A few of us mentioned then the evidence that Margaret Cassidy gave to the Health and Sport Committee. In the limited time available to me, I want to ensure that I put her views on the record again, because what she said is so powerful. When asked what life was like before personalisation and before she could direct her own budget, she said:</p><p>&#8220;It was so-so. I will tell you a wee thing. One time I wanted milk and the woman who was helping me said that that was not her job. I was only asking for a pint of milk, but she said, &#8216;By the way, that&#8217;s not my job.&#8217; I said to her, &#8216;What is your job?&#8217; We had a falling out and I told her, &#8216;There&#8217;s the door. Don&#8217;t come back.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 29 May 2012; c 2358.]</p><p>Margaret Cassidy now has a personal assistant and is doing wonderfully because she is directing the resource for her care that best meets her needs. That is what self-directed support is all about.</p><p>Following today&#8217;s stage 3 consideration, during which we had constructive engagement&#8212;and some disagreements&#8212;on the best way to improve the bill, it is important to remind ourselves that we are all travelling in the same direction. The bill has been improved&#8212;not always in the direction that some would have wanted&#8212;but I think that we can agree that it has been improved. Putting to one side my amendments, which were agreed to, I listened with interest to what Jackie Baillie said about charging. I think, however, that we all welcome the proposed regulations. If the minister is correct&#8212;and I believe that he is&#8212;we will be in a far superior position on charging when the bill is passed than we were beforehand. That is what legislating in this place is all about.</p><p>We have reinforced the principle of independent living and we now have greater transparency on the cost of the various options for self-directed support and the cash that follows that cost. That may not be in the way in which Richard Simpson proposed, but the Government has moved to improve the process. At every step of the way, the Parliament has come together to improve matters.</p><p>However, we will need to ensure that the changes that we are proposing sweep through every local authority in the country and that we back the culture change that will be needed in local authorities to make the bill work. For example, in my local authority&#8212;I do not always agree with what Glasgow City Council is doing, but in making this point I am talking about not self-directed support, but the local debate on the best way in which services should be delivered&#8212;the personalisation budget for those who would receive a resource allocation under self-directed support has been cut by 20 per cent. I have consistently disagreed with that, but it was a local political choice; it is not connected to the principles of self-directed support.</p><p>If members do not like what is happening in their local authority areas, they should challenge that and fight to improve the situation to make self-directed support work. However, no action that a local authority takes will undermine the principle of empowering people through self-directed support.</p><p>The other night, I promised a constituent who came to my surgery that I would mention the reform of day centres for adults with learning difficulties that is taking place in Glasgow. The reform will reduce the number of day centres from seven to four. That is a move away from the traditional service, but my understanding is that there was no consultation at any point with the clients who use the day centres and that the centres are to be closed, possibly as early as January. If self-directed support is to mean anything in service redesign, there must be consultation with service users to find out what type of service they want.</p><p>To return to the bill&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678418", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo the thanks to the minister, his team, my fellow committee members and all those who gave evidence to the committee, who have helped to shape and improve the bill.

At that level, the industry is far more susceptible to dramatic peaks and troughs than it is in comparable countries with a greater output.</p><p>The Scottish industry tends to be quite top heavy and is often driven by one or two blockbusters. In 2006, Scottish films took &#163;7 million at the UK box office, which was in large part due to Kevin Macdonald&#8217;s &#8220;The Last King of Scotland&#8221;. In 2005, however, Scottish films took only &#163;400,000 in the UK. That kind of instability discourages investment, and that can lead to greater instability.</p><p>Creative Scotland has noted that Scotland&#8217;s facilities for large-scale studio productions are fairly limited compared with those in similar countries and that they need to be improved. To compound matters, those countries often have more attractive tax incentives for investors. On that front, Ireland has often been cited as an example. Unlike Scotland&#8217;s average of five or six films per year, Ireland&#8217;s average is around 20, despite Ireland having a smaller population. Scotland has a globally recognised brand that is arguably more distinctive than that of countries such as Denmark, yet Denmark&#8217;s film industry is several times the size of ours.</p><p>I welcome tax breaks that exist at UK level. For instance, film production companies can claim significant additional tax relief for films with a core expenditure of more than &#163;20 million. Indeed, in the last UK budget, George Osborne announced that that would be extended in April 2013 to high-end UK drama, animation and video games. However, I see a structural flaw in that tax relief. It denies Scotland a specific competitive advantage and it denies Glasgow the advantage that it needs to become a creative centre of excellence. Whether we believe that an independent Scotland should be able to create bespoke tax conditions to attract the finest international production companies to Scotland or whether we believe that the UK Parliament should do that, we should all agree that it needs to be done, for the benefit of Glasgow and the benefit of Scotland&#8217;s film industry.</p><p>The Scottish Government has sought to target tax support to Glasgow for the promotion of the Scottish film industry by designating Creative Clyde, which encompasses Film City Glasgow and Pacific Quay, as an enterprise zone for the creative industries. Businesses based there can claim 100 per cent business tax relief, which represents an estimated injection of &#163;275,000 by the Scottish Government. Scottish Enterprise is also keen to attract a purpose-built film studio to Scotland that could rival the likes of Pinewood in England. I am sure that having enterprise zone status in Glasgow will give us the competitive edge in chasing that investment. I note that Creative Scotland is keen to contribute to that if it can do so. There are huge opportunities for Glasgow and for Scotland.</p><p>Glasgow City Council is also keen to promote film within the city, to its credit. It founded Glasgow Film Office for the express purpose of attracting international investment, and it has been successful. We have heard about the investment, the money and the exposure that &#8220;World War Z&#8221; brought to my city.</p><p>I believe that the Scottish Government, Creative Scotland, Scottish Enterprise and the city council are all focused on delivering film and production facilities for Glasgow and for Scotland. I am sure that Glasgow can become a film-making and production hub to rival any in Europe, but I ask the cabinet secretary, in her closing speech, to assure me that our Scottish Government is helping to co-ordinate those efforts. I look forward to a bright future for film production in Glasgow and across Scotland.

I do not think that members have said much about that in discussing television exposure.</p><p>The basic principle is that someone is innocent until found guilty. Donald Findlay asked the Justice Committee:</p><p>&#8220;If someone is acquitted, why should they have their image blasted into every home by the television?&#8221;</p><p>He also said:</p><p>&#8220;The lives of people who are convicted or acquitted of serious criminal charges could be put at risk, because there are people out there who want to seek vengeance.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 2 October 2012; c 1781-2.]</p><p>I associate myself with those concerns.</p><p>I would also like to comment on the position of victims of miscarriages of justice. I have specific constituency experience of that from two cases in particular. At the times of the trials, there was significant media interest. A victim of a miscarriage of justice has a statutory right to appeal, and the appeal can again be subject to significant media interest. One day, with almost no support, the person is released from jail and told that they can walk free, yet they receive less support from society than someone who was guilty and has served their time.</p><p>Such people are a tiny minority, thankfully, but their individual human rights need to be protected as well. Are we saying that their images should be blasted across the television? If we allow that to happen, it could create danger as well as compounding the miscarriage of justice. I have seen at first hand how such people&#8217;s mental and emotional wellbeing is damaged by the lack of support. I wanted to put that on the record while we are discussing media exposure.</p><p>I want to say something about the vulnerability of witnesses. Detective Chief Superintendent Cuddihy said in his evidence to the committee:</p><p>&#8220;When the due process of law results in judicial proceedings, we must ensure that victims, witnesses and their families are protected from the fear of intimidation and influence&#8212;perceived or otherwise&#8212;and that they are free to give evidence without any undue pressure being applied to them that may result in the integrity of the evidence, the trial and justice being compromised.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 2 October 2012; c 1793.]</p><p>Again, I associate myself with that concern.</p><p>Without going into any details, as that would be inappropriate, I am convinced that I have witnessed intimidation of witnesses in a courtroom simply by the fact the accused was in the same courtroom&#8212;never mind what would happen if greater exposure was shone on witnesses in the schemes and communities from which they come. I have significant concerns in relation to that.</p><p>I have significant concerns about the concept of someone who willingly gives evidence being labelled a grass by a minority of people in some of our communities and how that plays out in those areas. We should be doing what we can to support people to give evidence rather than putting barriers in their path. I am concerned that, although we want to see as much transparency as possible in the judicial system, we might not meet the ends of justice for people who are vulnerable by shining more of a light on the system.</p><p>On the other side, there is the issue of conniving witnesses. Not all witnesses go to court to tell the truth. If someone agrees to be a witness, there could be a concern that they will play to the audience when giving evidence. The criminal defence solicitor Aamer Anwar stated in his written submission that potential safeguards will do</p><p>&#8220;little to tackle how the filming of witnesses will stop them embellishing their evidence or tailoring it, due to the fact that they will be judged by millions watching at home&#8221;.</p><p>Indeed, witnesses may follow the trial via whatever media platform in advance of taking to the stand. That is another concern of mine.</p><p>I am concerned about how things will play out in the reporting of serious and organised crime. I tend to think that those involved at the very top of serious and organised crime do not like light to be shone on their activities, as they can be quite secretive. However, their henchmen are not that secretive and have a swagger in some of our communities. At times, they have been quite impudent when they have been on the witness stand or, indeed, been the accused. The idea of giving more exposure to that behaviour causes me significant concern. The issue is reducing, but it is still the case that in some of our communities glamour is associated with the gangster&#8212;the person who derives an income from criminality. I worry that the more exposure those people get, the more antiheroes we may create in some of our vulnerable communities. I therefore have a series of concerns.</p><p>Flipping completely on the issue, I go back to the core position that the more information we can get into the public domain about how the judicial system operates and the process of trials, the better. However, there is a huge array of significant issues, some of which I have outlined, which I am sure that the minister will consider when she weighs up her personal views on what will of course be an independent judicial review of the role of the media in the justice system.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of the Media in Criminal Trials"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will say a little about the role of the accused in the process.

I am delighted to see that there is a &#163;100,000 investment from the Scottish Government to try to progress that further.</p><p>One of the issues with the GP referral system is that there is sometimes little or no choice. Dr Cindy Gray, who is a research fellow at the institute of health and wellbeing at the University of Glasgow, agreed with that and said that a real choice for patients is vital. Dr Gray is an important person to hear when we are considering whether we can justify additional spend in this area, as she is currently analysing the football fans in training programme that is supported by the SPL Trust. The programme involves SPL clubs working in partnership with GPs and patients, and uses the clubs&#8217; brands to get more people physically active. That sort of approach can be pursued not just in football but in basketball, cricket and rugby. We should roll out that model in community sports. Choice is key. The analysis that the University of Glasgow is doing is also key, because we have to justify spending taxpayers&#8217; money. Early intervention and getting people physically active rather than leaving them to suffer from ill health is the way to go, but we have to quantify the benefits of that approach.</p><p>I will finish with a suggestion of my own. During the evidence-taking sessions, there was much discussion of which sports gained benefit from cashback for communities and which did not. John Park mentioned apprenticeships and talked about the focus on that, as did Margo MacDonald. I suggest that we leverage a weighting of proceeds of crime funds into areas with great health inequalities. If we can invest more money in the areas and groups that suffer from health inequalities&#8212;whether through GP practices or community sports&#8212;we could make a real difference. Our committee might consider that issue.</p><p>The debate has been excellent.

If the Scottish Government gets the bill right, I firmly believe that history will show that the legislation was the most empowering law for local communities for many years. As Scotland quite rightly seeks more powers for herself, it is only right that we should all consider how we can give other powers directly to our communities.</p><p>I want to use two local issues in Glasgow to highlight how the bill could empower Glaswegians and ensure that councils across Scotland do better to ensure that there is real community planning locally, not just a tick-box exercise at the end of a process, once decisions have been taken. We must ensure that community priorities are implemented as a result of real consultation, at the start of the process, rather than there being consultation at the end, confirming a local authority&#8217;s view that it knew best all along.</p><p>The two examples that I will use involve situations in which Glasgow City Council has not achieved a high standard, and I hope to show how the bill could help it to do better in future. In doing so, I do not intend simply to lambast the council for its past shortcomings; rather I intend to offer pointers on how we can work together constructively, so that it can do better in future.</p><p>The first example concerns the more than 20 primary schools that the council closed a few years ago. The issues with that programme are well documented. There was no real consultation process; it was seen as a done deal&#8212;a fait accompli. Indeed, the only school that received a reprieve from the mass school closure policy was Ruchill primary school, which moved to a new campus a year or two later&#8212;the local authority had forgotten that it contained a co-located autism unit and that, if the school closed, the unit would be left sitting on its own.</p><p>I do not want to open the can of worms of the rights and wrongs of the policy; I want to consider what happened to the school buildings that were closed. Most of them were deemed to be surplus to requirements and were demolished. In some cases, there was an option to transfer them to City Property, but the fact is that the consultation document that was issued at the beginning of the process presupposed that the schools would be demolished. Where was the community empowerment in that?</p><p>St Gregory&#8217;s primary and Wyndford primary, on the Wyndford estate in Maryhill, were closed and were scheduled for demolition. However, such was the strength of the local campaign that the council decided to set up a task force for the area. The outcome of that was that one of the schools was relaunched as a community hub&#8212;indeed, it was nicknamed the Wyndford hub. It is now run by Glasgow community and safety services and it provides some vital facilities for local areas. However, to be honest, it is limping along financially. That is because it was set up as an afterthought in the community planning process.</p><p>If community empowerment is to mean anything, communities should be engaged at the outset in issues around the school estate, such as whether schools stay open or close and whether their use should change. However, that did not happen in Glasgow. A similar situation may have happened in other local authority areas, too, and the bill will ensure that there is a statutory duty to ensure genuine community empowerment. Further, where possible, let us not have Glasgow community and safety services running a building; let us have it run and managed by the community.</p><p>I will give another example of where Glasgow City Council took the wrong approach. All politicians would agree that the Cadder community centre has been run down over many years, first by Glasgow City Council and latterly by Glasgow Life, one of the council&#8217;s arm&#8217;s-length organisations. When, a few years ago, its doors were locked&#8212;again, a fait accompli, without any consultation&#8212;there was a local campaign to save it. I am delighted to say that the council listened, but it listened at the end of the process. I am thankful to community campaigners and Cadder housing association, who took on responsibility for running the building.</p><p>If a community asset such as a community centre has been run down in a planned fashion over five, 10 or 15 years, which is why it is underutilised, why does the community have to wait until the local authority puts a padlock on the door before it is allowed to take it over? I believe that if the bill is to mean anything, a community should have a statutory right to take over a community facility if it does not agree with the council&#8217;s strategic plan for a community facility or thinks that the council is managing its planned decline. Further, that right should be followed up by funding&#8212;as has been said already, the policy should not be about disposing of community assets as part of planned decline and de-investment on the part of local authorities.</p><p>Those two aspects are vital if local authorities are to get community empowerment and community planning right. Glasgow has not always got it right. I think that that is not because it does not want to get it right; I think that there is a cultural problem. We have to support improvements in that culture, and the bill is the way to do it.</p><p>I commend the considerations that I have outlined to the minister as part of the consultation on the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in this debate on the consultation on the proposed community empowerment and renewal bill.

I thought that it was the job of an Opposition party to scrutinise the legislative programme, but Labour Party members have singularly failed to do that at any point over the past two days. I will talk about the legislative programme that is before us, unlike Labour members, who have been more obsessed with the constitution than SNP members have been, which is quite remarkable.</p><p>We have 15 pieces of legislation before us. First, I want to look at the rights of children and young people bill. I welcome the bill and, in particular, how it will build on the 20 per cent increase in nursery provision for three and four-year-olds that has been delivered since 2007. It will guarantee a statutory minimum of 600 hours of childcare per year, which once implemented will represent a 50 per cent increase in nursery provision since 2007. That level of growth is remarkable, and we should all welcome and support it.</p><p>Some people have levelled the accusation that there might not be a need for legislation, but I believe that it is because childcare must be practical and flexible to maximise the benefit to parents, to children and to the economy that we must legislate. We must ensure that, when local authorities deliver that childcare, they meet their responsibilities to provide it in a flexible way. That is why I believe that legislation is necessary. Therefore, I will follow that aspect of the bill closely, to ensure that such flexible provision is offered to our communities.</p><p>I also welcome the move to include vulnerable two-year-olds within the ambit of such nursery provision. Labour members were shamefully disparaging of that move and demanded more provision without highlighting how any additional provision could be funded. It is not the job of the Opposition to do that. I strongly believe that expanding early years provision is the right thing to do and that the Scottish Government&#8217;s move to provide childcare for vulnerable two-year-olds should be welcomed.</p><p>That move can, of course, be built on. I would be keen to know whether there is any prospect of the &#163;18 million for families from the early years change fund that was announced yesterday being used to extend the provision of early years childcare for two-year-olds in some areas of the country. Another avenue that is open to the Scottish Government when it comes to identifying a potential funding stream is to consider using some of the European structural funds for the period 2014-20 to help to deliver additional care for two-year-olds&#8212;if Parliament chose to do that.</p><p>I would be keen for such an approach to be piloted in a small number of deprived areas in Scotland, and I can think of areas in north Glasgow that would be ideal for such a pilot. I fully accept that, in difficult financial times, the lion&#8217;s share of such funds is likely to go to attempts to boost employment and infrastructure, but a long-term approach to early years investment could be partly funded from any pot of cash that is spent between 2014 and 2020.</p><p>I therefore welcome the rights of children and young people bill, which, importantly, will also make provision for a new kinship care order. I will follow the bill&#8217;s progress through the Parliament and will help to scrutinise it carefully, which the Labour Party does not seem to be capable of doing.</p><p>I also welcome the integration of adult health and social care bill, which is essential to break down the barriers to integrated provision that are often spoken about but not always acted on. Those barriers are often budgetary&#8212;I will come back to that in a second&#8212;and cultural. It is vital that the public money that is used to support our ageing population is used to keep people happy and healthy in our communities and in their homes for longer. Issues related to when older people are discharged from hospital&#8212;indeed, their early discharge from hospital&#8212;need to be addressed. Does cost shunting go on from time to time? Many people think that there is cost shunting between local authorities and health boards.</p><p>The money that it costs to look after an older person in hospital, at home or in a residential care facility should ideally come from the same budget, and services and budget should be seamlessly integrated. Under the legislation, that will happen. Of course, community health partnerships were supposed to take that forward but, despite some efforts, there has been cultural resistance and progress has been slow.</p><p>Placing such integration on a statutory footing is vital to drive change. With Scotland&#8217;s over-65 population set to rise by 62 per cent by 2031, and the cost of health and social care predicted to rise by an additional &#163;2.5 billion over the next 20 years, it is important such integration happens, and happens very soon. There is no other option.</p><p>I was genuinely disappointed that when the ruling administration in Glasgow looked at health and social care integration last week it was seethingly negative towards it. It identified two aspects that it did not particularly like, which were integrated budgets and accountable officers in charge of the money. It was shying away from those two things, which are fundamental to making the integration of health and social care work and on which Jackie Baillie&#8212;Labour&#8217;s health spokesperson in this chamber&#8212;agrees with the Scottish Government. I ask Ms Baillie and her national Labour Party colleagues to have a word with Glasgow City Council. We need that council to be on side for health and social care integration, or it will let down the constituents in Glasgow whom I represent, which would be simply not good enough.</p><p>I hope that we have some positive and constructive scrutiny of the Scottish Government&#8217;s legislative programme. If Labour cannot provide it, I will be happy to do so.

I have written to Mike Russell and Fiona Hyslop about my concerns.</p><p>I have been in regular contact with lecturers in recent months and, having met them, I am well aware of how change at North Glasgow is affecting them. Nobody wants courses to be reduced anywhere, but duplication of course provision and cuts to the Scottish Government&#8217;s revenue from Westminster have led to tough choices.</p><p>It is worth noting that the number of full-time equivalent courses at the college has increased since the Scottish National Party came to power. The college received around &#163;8.5&#160;million for course provision and student funding in 2012-13. Although that does not negate the current financial challenges that are faced by the college, some of which where outlined by Patricia Ferguson, it is important to put that investment on the record.</p><p>I note gently that no other political party has proposed a different budget settlement on further education and that the FE sector is stronger than the one that was inherited in 2007 by the SNP Government. Once more, although that does not negate the current challenges, it is important to put it on the record.</p><p>I want to look past party politics and to voice my specific concerns, following meetings with the sound and music department at North Glasgow College. I met the college&#8217;s principal, Ronnie Knox, and sought a clear explanation from him on the rationale for course alterations in the college. Many believe that with a reduction of around 10 FTE staff to around five FTE staff, the sound and music department has taken more than its fair share of course reductions.</p><p>A final round of cuts was recently announced, and &#163;45,000 worth of cuts was identified in the sound and music department. Staff were interviewed to find out which staff member may have to be redeployed. Staff were also informed that 20 places on courses would be reprovisioned to other colleges in the sector. However, staff were constructive and formulated an alternative business plan that would not only have allowed the department to maintain its current staffing levels and course provision, but would have raised additional revenue, including using money from individual learning accounts and other funding streams to make up the shortfall. Unfortunately, the college rejected the plan.</p><p>I stress that all staff members in the department remain loyal and committed to the college and the students. I welcome North Glasgow College&#8217;s on-going commitment to a policy of no compulsory redundancies. There is an understanding that course reductions may be a reality in the short term. However, many people feel that the process has not been handled as well or communicated as effectively as it could have been.</p><p>Ronnie Knox has assured me that he will provide additional information about how the process was taken forward. He has also given reassurances that the sound and music department has a future at the college.

I welcome the idea of having a third members&#8217; business debate, which will be embedded in a plenary session rather than being an add-on at the end. I genuinely welcome that, although the slot after First Minister&#8217;s question time might be seen as an add-on in itself. We will have to monitor that. I am disappointed that the person who secures a members&#8217; business debate will not have a right to reply after other members have had their say, but before the minister sums up. However, I take on board the Presiding Officer&#8217;s concerns that that might change the dynamic of members&#8217; business debates, and that it would have to be handled quite seriously.</p><p>I have one or two further comments to make. We will have a plenary session on Tuesday afternoons. Some MSPs do not come to Parliament until Wednesday, although it is not because they are not working; they are working in their constituencies. That can mean that Tuesday afternoons and evenings are a bit of a graveyard slot when it comes to wider engagement with the public and evening events. If more MSPs are here on a Tuesday afternoon, it might mean a more vibrant Tuesday evening and more engagement with civic Scotland. That could be a benefit.</p><p>Paul Martin talked about holding ministers to account. The Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&#8217;s report says that we favour fewer questions being asked of ministers but more supplementaries. If a member is dissatisfied after asking their question and their supplementary question, rather than another member getting to ask the next question, the original member could get a second or third attempt at a follow-up question. The Presiding Officer has said that she will consider allowing that in the future once the current reforms have bedded in.</p><p>This is quite a dynamic set of reforms, which contains a lot of good news. Although I might wish the reforms to go further, it is important for the Presiding Officer and the Parliamentary Bureau to take a balanced approach.

Andy Kerr is no longer here, but one thing that has not changed is Labour&#8217;s absolute hypocrisy in relation to the taxing of supermarkets and their profits. In Parliament, the Scottish Government has proposed a Scottish public health supplement.

Dr Simpson has sought to rubbish the Sheffield study at every turn, but he has spectacularly failed to do so. He now points to one part of it that he completely misunderstands. The Sheffield study does not talk about windfall profits but about potential increased revenue. From Dr Simpson&#8217;s contribution, we can see that he clearly does not understand the difference.</p><p>Let us look at the potential increased revenue from a minimum unit price of 50p. Nowhere is &#163;124 million mentioned, as Dr Simpson suggests. The figure is &#163;98 million, but that is for both the on-trade and the off-trade. The supermarkets could get a share of &#163;69 million but that figure will be reduced because of the small amount of off-sales and the small proprietors out there in the economy who will take additional revenue. It is additional revenue, not profit.</p><p>I far prefer what Jackson Carlaw and Gil Paterson said. We must take a balanced view and approach to taxing supermarkets appropriately.

He has accused SNP back benchers a number of times of being overtly evangelical in promoting the potential benefits of minimum pricing. Perhaps at times we have been, Mr Carlaw.

I learned lots of interesting things that I did not anticipate finding out this afternoon. For example, I now know what the baby diets of both Hanzala Malik and Nanette Milne were. I did not expect to learn that, nor did I expect to find out that Mark McDonald was a highly active person until he started obsessively tweeting Alison Johnstone, or that Gil Paterson&#8217;s real reason for being physically inactive is that he secretly watches &#8220;Hannah Montana&#8221; with his daughter.</p><p>Much of what has been reiterated this afternoon was not alarming; many of the poor health statistics are more predictable than alarming, if we are honest about it.</p><p>I welcome the tapering off of the decline in healthiness and of the increase in obesity, and the gradual increase in physical activity that we have heard about, but poor health and diets and low physical activity levels are not inevitable in Scotland. I am reminded of recent conversations about alcohol. Harry Burns has already been mentioned. He talks about a relationship with alcohol as not being inevitable and takes us back just a few decades to when Scotland was seen as a moderate nation in its drinking habits. He has significant information to pass on about how we can promote positive health outcomes in Scotland. He speaks about people not necessarily being born healthy, getting older and having their health decline, but about the need for Scottish people&#8212;indeed, all the people in the world&#8212;to nurture and develop their health as they go through life. That is vital as we take forward any initiative to tackle obesity and promote physical activity.</p><p>I want to say a little bit about the work that goes on in schools. Other members, including Mark Griffin, have shared their school experiences. I concur with part of what Mark Griffin said. It is hard to believe, but I was quite a fit and healthy person at school, as I had a teacher who promoted Gaelic football&#8212;not football&#8212;in it. I bought into that and was a fit and healthy young man as a result. It is about giving additional choice in schools to young people rather than offering just traditional sports, which, for parts of the west of Scotland, seems to have always meant soccer. In that context, I will give a little mention to St Roch&#8217;s secondary school in Springburn, which has developed quite a successful rugby initiative, which is good to see. It diversifies the team sports agenda there, although much of the work is done on a voluntary basis by staff and parents.</p><p>I would like to mention the success of the active school networks and the &#163;12 million per annum investment to give a structured approach to physical activities in schools, not only the traditional sports. Excellent work is going on in schools.</p><p>We have heard about the transition between school and later life, particularly for young females, who tend not to stay physically active as they get older. There is a similar but not identical trend for boys; it is just not as marked. The transition between school and the life of work is a key point and the Government has to find a way of taking more action to keep people physically active at that point. Physical activity is a habit that many people get into at school but do not retain, for whatever reason, once out in the world of work. It would be good to hear more about how we can take that forward.</p><p>On the strength of community sports clubs, I have been remarkably impressed by the organisation of running clubs across Glasgow and Scotland. Earlier this year, I had the privilege of attending the Nigel Barge 10K race for Maryhill Harriers. I say to Patricia Ferguson that I did not participate in the race&#8212;I am impressed that she has done 5Ks regularly in the past few years&#8212;but a plethora of running clubs took part, and there was a junior section, which was fantastic to see. We have to find a way of promoting such things across Government.</p><p>Many community sports initiatives have been supported by cashback for communities, which I welcome. I give a small plug for the twilight basketball initiative in Glasgow. I know that Glasgow Rocks has been quite heavily involved in that.</p><p>Another fitness initiative that has been successful and which has received a lot of publicity recently is the football fans in training initiative, and I had the pleasure of visiting Parkhead to see it in action. I want to plug the general work that all football clubs do, not only with the FFIT programme, but in throwing open their doors and facilities to the wider community to promote a range of activities for young people in the local area and their staff. I think that Gil Paterson mentioned the world of work, and Dennis Robertson mentioned that the world of work does not sit well with a fit and healthy lifestyle. Whether we are talking about Glasgow city chambers, Parkhead, town halls across the country or large employers, perhaps workplaces must do more to promote fit and healthy options and lifestyles for workforces and the general public who stay in the area. They have the facilities. They can throw them open, and people can get benefits from them.</p><p>Finally, the football fans in training initiative that I mentioned is carried out in partnership with the University of Glasgow. I hope to see for the first time real and robust data on the benefits of using sporting clubs as preventative spending champions in the positive health agenda to provide evidence for investing more in that. We should invest more in that approach, but I realise that we must get evidence to monitor its effectiveness.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667320", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been an interesting debate.

I understand why some people argue that the more responsible a Parliament is for directly raising its own income, the more responsibly it is likely to use those powers in governing and marshalling finances. On one level, I cannot fathom why a UK Government does not want to go further in giving Scotland even more borrowing and fiscal powers within the UK, as it would not shoulder any of the risk. The Parliament and Scotland would have to borrow. If growth did not come, the Parliament would shoulder the risk. However, some of the gains when unemployment fell and from income tax receipts, national insurance, VAT, increased fuel consumption and the related duty that would be collected, profits from businesses, and benefits that would come from growth would also accrue to the UK Exchequer.

It was exceptional in outlining the devastating effects that these reforms will have and she correctly identified the fact that the landscape for benefits in Scotland is changing. Other negative changes are coming. For example, nearly 85,000 households in Scotland will no longer be eligible for tax credits from this April, and that is before one starts to mention the disability living allowance and incapacity benefit reforms. It is important that we view the housing benefit cuts within that context.</p><p>As we have heard, there will be draconian sanctions such as the underoccupancy penalties, which will see the UK Government introduce cuts to the amount of housing benefit tenants can receive if they are deemed to have a spare room in their council or housing association home. That reduction will essentially mean that households deemed to be &#8220;underoccupied&#8220;&#8212;another term that I have issues with, like others who have spoken&#8212;will be charged a penalty as the reduced amount of benefit will become rent paid directly by the tenant through additional top-ups from any other benefits or incomes that they have.</p><p>I will look at the area where I stay and at how these changes will affect people there. According to the SFHA, the average weekly rent charge for two-bedroom households in north Glasgow is &#163;63.88 a week, or about &#163;283 a month. For households that are deemed to be underoccupying a property by a single bedroom in that area, the proposed 14 per cent benefit cut equates to an additional &#163;465 a year&#8212;the equivalent of seven and a half weeks&#8217; rent&#8212;that they will have to find from their own resources. The Tories are actually saying that if people need a year&#8217;s shelter, they will pay for 10 months but for the other two months that person is on their own. That is not acceptable and we should not be accepting it in Scotland.</p><p>In north Glasgow alone, the SFHA estimates that the change will affect almost 1,700 households. I will talk about a couple of constituents whose experience relates directly to this point, although I will not name them. One is about to reach retirement age and they are currently underoccupying their accommodation as they have a spare room. They are worried about their benefits being cut. They are also looking perhaps to go into sheltered accommodation but, because they have not reached retirement age, they are worried about being reassessed for personal independence payments and other benefits. They are unsure whether they should move to sheltered accommodation as they are worried on a number of levels about whether they will be able to sustain their income and stay there. It is not merely a question of the housing benefit reforms, but of how they will impact on other wider welfare reforms.</p><p>Another constituent who came to see me just the other day needs a two-bedroom property but is seriously considering whether he should get one or not. His son, who sometimes stays with him, will be deemed not to be entitled to that bedroom and housing benefit will therefore not cover it. Those are real people who will suffer real and direct impacts from these ill-considered, inappropriate reforms.</p><p>The UK Government has chosen to ignore exemptions in such areas and the most vulnerable people in society are likely to suffer. If someone&#8217;s partner has come back from hospital and needs a spare room because of their medical condition, they will not have that spare room. If someone&#8217;s child has been taken into care and they want that child to return to their accommodation, they might no longer have the benefits to support that child in their home. Those are the most vulnerable people in society, whom we should be defending.</p><p>I will refer briefly to the Labour amendment, which talks about mitigation. From what I can see and from the search that I have undertaken, a lot of mitigation activities are already taking place. For example, in November, &#163;100,000 of funding was announced to support three strands of activity involving the Chartered Institute of Housing, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and local authorities to see what they can do to mitigate the worst aspects of housing benefit reform and its impact on the most vulnerable people in society. Unfortunately, the key phrase is that we should mitigate &#8220;where possible&#8221;. Anyone in the Parliament who pretends that we can mitigate all the effects is in absolute denial.</p><p>I say to the Labour Party that the only Trojan horse in the chamber today might be a Scottish Labour Party that is giving succour to UK Tory welfare reforms by telling us that if we mention independence and a better way we are not in solidarity with other people in the UK. However, if we could kill the reforms stone dead in Scotland, no one else in the UK would accept them either, so give us the controls now.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663621", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Benefit Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will start by paying tribute to Margaret Burgess for her speech.

The Sheffield study is not a single piece of evidence; it marshals a wide range of the evidence available to analyse the link between price and consumption, and between consumption and harm. All parties on the Health and Sport Committee, including the Labour Party, acknowledged that those links existed. Indeed, all parties agreed that the University of Sheffield&#8217;s modelling work was valuable and reliable.</p><p>There is direct evidence from here in Scotland to demonstrate just how robust that work was. The university was asked to do modelling work for the Scottish Government&#8217;s alcohol multibuy ban before it was introduced. The results predicted that beer sales would fall by 8 per cent; they did. They predicted that wine sales would fall by 6.1 per cent; they fell by 5 per cent. They predicted that the sale of spirits would fall by 2.7 per cent; it fell by 3 per cent. It is clear that the impact of the multibuy ban closely mirrored the predictions.</p><p>With that in mind, let us look at some of the predictions from the Sheffield study on the potential benefit of minimum pricing if the unit price is set at 45p in the first year. It is predicted that there would be 36 fewer alcohol-related deaths, 950 fewer hospital admissions and 310 fewer violent crimes, and that &#163;36 million would be saved in related costs. Those are estimations of course&#8212;the real numbers may vary to a greater or lesser extent within a margin of error&#8212;but those are impressive statistics, which are backed up with robust evidence. Of course, no price can be put on the benefit to an individual whose life is not ruined by alcohol or to the family or community in which they live.</p><p>The committee took evidence from Canada, where various forms of minimum pricing exist.

Labour claimed that minimum pricing would not be effective with harmful drinkers. Not even the research that Labour cited substantiates that claim. The committee discovered that research from the Centre for Economics and Business Research did not look at the types of drink that each group of drinkers was consuming.

Indeed, that was the approach that our committee took to the inquiry into the regulation of care of older people. I thank the members of our committee for that approach. In my thanks, I would like to include the former members of the committee Mary Fee and Mary Scanlon, who served the committee well during their time on it. I also thank the clerking team, SPICe, all those who gave evidence, whether in written form or in person, and all those members who have made positive contributions to the debate, a number of which I will touch on.</p><p>However, I will start with a more general point. Our committee system can make a powerful contribution to driving positive change. That is exactly what I believe the Health and Sport Committee has achieved in relation to improving the system of regulation of care of older people.</p><p>When the committee embarked on its inquiry, we were determined to scrutinise the regulatory framework for some of our most vulnerable citizens in a rigorous, non-partisan and mature way, and that is what we did. Of course, our interest in the subject was raised by the tragedy at the Elsie Inglis home and the debacle surrounding Southern Cross, but it is worth stressing that our inquiry had at its core a significant degree of post-legislative scrutiny. There had been no rigorous review of legislation in the area since the implementation of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001, since when it should be noted that the tragedy at the Elsie Inglis home and the Southern Cross debacle occurred.</p><p>I am sure that fellow committee members will agree that increased post-legislative scrutiny by our committees would be beneficial to the Parliament. While admitting that our inquiry was prompted by public concerns about high-profile incidents, as opposed to being a pre-planned effort on the committee&#8217;s part, I believe that the regulation of care of older people is all the better for it.</p><p>We should put on record the committee&#8217;s unanimous belief that the current system was sufficiently rigorous, but that that does not mean that there are not always various areas in which the system of regulation must be improved.</p><p>It is also worth noting that there remains cross-party support for the use of a risk-based assessment process in the regulation of care of older people, that risk assessment should be robustly evidence driven and that the frequency and type of inspection should be proportionate to that risk. Indeed, the Health and Sport Committee made several recommendations specifically on those points.</p><p>In his opening speech, Duncan McNeil rightly pointed out that there seemed to be a lack of clarity around whether inspections should judge care against two or four quality themes. It is a minimum of two and a maximum of four, based on a risk assessment. I draw to members&#8217; attention the fact that the regulatory assessment tool&#8212;the tool by which one assesses the risk in the first place&#8212;has been reviewed by the care inspectorate and improved for the current year.</p><p>I listened with interest to Jackie Baillie&#8217;s contribution, in which she rightly identified a dramatic drop in the quality of care at the Elsie Inglis nursing home. The committee accepted in taking evidence that that could happen under any regulatory system, no matter how robust it was. What is important is how effectively we pick up on those dramatic falls in care standards. We are all working on the same agenda, which is to improve the system. I mentioned the regulatory assessment tool because that is the way in which we collect the evidence to allow us to pick up on those situations in which the quality of the care service has dramatically fallen.</p><p>Jackie Baillie also mentioned issues around procurement and the living wage. The committee was concerned about those matters, and I note that the Government has had further discussions with COSLA in that regard. It is only right that the committee will want to see where those discussions arrive at.</p><p>The complaints process has been a common theme in the debate: it was discussed by members such as Malcolm Chisholm, Sandra White, Richard Lyle, Nanette Milne and Mary Fee, to mention just a few. The committee believes that the complaints process is vital but the process should be positive. An open complaints process drives positive improvement in care homes, and those that are up for the challenge should have nothing to fear.</p><p>I note that Nanette Milne welcomed the guidance on confidential complaints that we are hoping to see in the near future, which links in with the concerns that we have heard about whistleblowing.</p><p>It is important to mention Mary Scanlon&#8217;s comments on the use of psychoactive drugs, which were a passionate display on an issue that she has been following for a number of years. The Scottish Government has said that it is in discussions with the care inspectorate and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland to improve those standards and link them to dementia standards. I sense Mary Scanlon&#8217;s frustration. Although that is the right thing to do, she wants tangible outcomes to show whether things have improved. I am sure that our committee will want to monitor that in future.</p><p>Jim Eadie mentioned the duty of care for the wider health professional groups. I know that undergraduate training for doctors and nurses will be bolstered to remind students of that. Perhaps we should extend it to training for other health professionals.</p><p>I will highlight one of the committee&#8217;s recommendations, which will, I hope, become common practice in a few years&#8217; time. We identified that the inspection process for health and social care is not integrated. Ron Culley of COSLA told the committee that the current system of regulation was centred on general service provision and that we should move to a system that is more focused on individual outcomes. Geraldine Doherty of the Scottish Social Services Council agreed with that.</p><p>As we progress further down the road of closer health and social care integration, it is particularly important that the care pathway for individuals is assessed in a meaningful way. I do not want to overplay the importance of that but, given the current legislative context in respect of closer integration, it is vital that we get it right.</p><p>Joint inspections and closer working are vital if we are to make progress. When the care inspectorate&#8212;or whoever&#8212;enters a care home, it is reasonable to hope that the inspectors will examine the care journey for some of the residents and families who use the care home and how an individual came to be in that care home, whether they or their family believe that they could have been supported in their own home for longer and, if they had a stay in hospital before they arrived at the care home, what the quality of care in the hospital was like. The care pathway&#8212;the human journey&#8212;is where we must take the care system in future. Joint inspection work is one way to do that, and it is important.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662481", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulation of Care for Older People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a privilege to sum up for the Health and Sport Committee in what, in general, has been a positive, informative and constructive debate.

I look forward to that being confirmed once the Government has considered the consultation responses. I will be interested to know what various organisations have said about station closures once the responses become publicly available.</p><p>People have been concerned about train stations, and the Evening Times has played an important role in voicing those concerns&#8212;a responsibility that I know the newspaper takes seriously. Glasgow MSPs have a responsibility to address any concerns that are raised, which is why I met the transport minister and gained the reassurances that I believed were important. However, MSPs also have a responsibility to suggest enhancements to our rail network&#8212;indeed, we were encouraged to do so.</p><p>I therefore thank the Labour Party for so generously donating its debating time to me this morning; I will use it to draw to the minister&#8217;s attention once more some of the suggestions that I made in response to the rail 2014 consultation.</p><p>One issue that I raised concerns service provision on the Maryhill line. I often use the line to go to meetings with constituents, and it has been a significant success. However, the service remains incomplete: it does not run on Sundays except occasionally at Christmas time.</p><p>I will provide some examples of why a Sunday rail service is important. In Kelvindale there is a high level of car ownership, and 50 per cent of train tickets that are sold there are season tickets, which highlights the importance of the train for commuting to work. On Sundays, residents still wish to travel, and if they want to go shopping in the city centre, for example, they may well choose to use a car instead of the train for that journey. They may even skip the city centre altogether and take a car to the out-of-town shopping centres. A Sunday service could therefore have both economic and strong environmental benefits.</p><p>At Gilshochill station, which is on the same line, passenger numbers have trebled in the past four years. The Cadder area of Glasgow that the station serves is not well served by alternative public transport links and has a lower level of car ownership. The train is an important service for that community, and extending the service to run on Sundays would meet local social need. Other stations on the line are in a similar position.</p><p>I ask the minister to be cautious about any analysis that he may receive of passenger numbers for the four Sundays before Christmas, when First ScotRail occasionally runs trains as part of its franchise commitment, as those services have been subject to cancellations. In 2011, the service ran only on two Sundays before Christmas, and in 2010 it did not run at all.</p><p>Uptake of such services depends on commuters being aware of them, and on strong service reliability. There is likely to be significant room for improvement on both counts. Consequently, any data that is received on demand for a Sunday service will be highly unreliable. I therefore ask that consideration be given to my suggestion that services on the Maryhill line be expanded to run on Sundays on a regular basis, and for that to be a potential condition of any future franchise.</p><p>I am sure that the minister will want to consider the various suggestions that I made in my submission, including the feasibility of a train station at Robroyston, enhancements on the Newton line and greater connectivity in north Glasgow. I explored the idea of connecting the Maryhill and Springburn lines; the price for that was an eye-watering &#163;40 million to &#163;60 million, but in the medium to long term, we must take a strategic look at developing the rail network.</p><p>Finally, it would be worth exploring the idea of a not-for-profit operator.

As the deputy convener of the Health and Sport Committee, I was privileged to take evidence from the voluntary sector organisations that represent many vulnerable citizens who will be affected by the UK welfare reforms. Whether they were representatives of single parents, of disabled people or of people who rely on social housing, they spoke passionately about the people whom they represent, and knowledgeably about the damaging impact of the proposed reforms to Scotland.</p><p>I want to find ways of supporting individuals back into employment and I want to identify anyone who unreasonably refuses an employment opportunity that is open to them and which would be affordable and of benefit to them. I want to ensure that the complicated web of welfare and benefits support that is given to individuals, whether they are in or out of work, is simplified. The same is true for the organisations that represent disabled people and other vulnerable groups. On that basis, the concepts of a universal credit and personal independence payments could have been welcomed. However, the reality of the proposed reforms bears no relation to those aims and objectives, which is why Parliament must reject them.</p><p>The UK Government seeks to use welfare reform as a crude attempt to reduce the UK budget deficit at the expense of some of the most vulnerable groups in Scottish society. To mask savage cuts to the benefits of our most vulnerable citizens as an attempt to support people back into employment is fundamentally wrong. Both the UK coalition partners&#8212;the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats&#8212;should be ashamed of themselves.</p><p>It is equally unacceptable that we, Scotland&#8217;s Parliament, do not have the powers over welfare and benefits that would allow us to prevent such damaging Westminster reforms from sweeping across Scotland. However, I will move away from the constitutional element of the debate. I have spoken to many of those who will be affected and know that they want the parties in Scotland to work together to do all that they can to prevent such harmful UK reforms, so I am pleased that SNP and Labour members are in agreement that the UK welfare reforms are not fit for purpose. That is the message that Scotland&#8217;s national Parliament sends this morning. The overwhelming majority of Scotland&#8217;s democratically elected politicians will reject these damaging welfare and benefit cuts. Either the UK Government must listen to that voice or Scotland must be able to decide on welfare and benefits for itself.</p><p>I will look at the details of how the proposal to move from disability living allowance to personal independence payments, which will begin in 2013, will impact on Scotland. When a change in the payments system is proposed, it is reasonable to ask what its purpose is. Is it a change in name only, from DLA to PIP, or does it have substance? If we scratch beneath the surface, we find out that everybody of working age who receives DLA must be reassessed from 2013 onwards.</p><p>The UK Government has set a target of reducing the benefits bill by 20 per cent. The UK Government expects the bill to reduce by that amount as people who receive DLA are reassessed and moved on to personal independence payments. If assessments are conducted sensitively and appropriately, they can be fine. However, the UK Government is, in effect, saying that at least one in five disabled people of working age in Scotland will be impacted negatively by the reforms. That means that 230,000 of the most vulnerable people in Scotland are in the UK Tory firing line and might experience a damaging impact from the cuts.</p><p>The Tories and the Lib Dems have shown their hand, and the result will be a 20 per cent cut. They have predetermined the results of reassessment of people who receive DLA, and have undermined any credibility in the process at any point.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657862", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will follow on from the comments of the committee convener, Duncan McNeil.

As a Glasgow MSP, I, too, have visited some of the facilities that are coming on line, in particular the velodrome and the related indoor arena. They are part of a spectacular transformation of the east end of Glasgow with which I am proud to be associated. It is a million miles from the old perceptions of Glasgow: the &#8220;No Mean City&#8221; tag that existed previously, and the Victorian sandstone gloom across the city. Modern-day Glasgow is far from that. The partnership work between the Scottish Government&#8212;and the previous Scottish Executive under Jack McConnell&#8212;and Steven Purcell at Glasgow City Council has been quite powerful and successful. It shows exactly what we can do when all parties work together.</p><p>The Commonwealth games will take Glasgow the brand to the next level and cement the city&#8217;s position as a global player. I will touch on the previous attempts to improve Glasgow&#8217;s image, which Sandra White mentioned. Those initiatives were to be welcomed&#8212;and I still welcome them&#8212;but many of them were city-centre based, with shiny new buildings and conference facilities on Clydeside. They seemed a million miles away to many deprived communities just 1 or 2 miles down the road, which did not think that the Glasgow regeneration was for them. That is not a criticism of previous regeneration attempts, but we must acknowledge that they were city-centre based and isolated some of our most deprived communities.</p><p>The difference with the Commonwealth games is that the investment is not so much in the city centre, but directly in some of our most impoverished communities. That is very different from what has happened before. It is an infrastructure legacy that is very real and direct to many vulnerable groups, and not remote from them as previous regeneration attempts may have been.</p><p>We have the games village, the velodrome, the M74, the Clyde Gateway, the Tollcross international swimming centre&#8212;the list goes on and on. It is a meaty list of successful projects that are coming on line. Indeed, there is a financial boon too: 82 per cent of all contracts that were offered were successfully tendered for by Scottish companies. I take on board Hanzala Malik&#8217;s reasonable points about small and medium-sized companies. The meat behind the infrastructure is &#163;523 million of investment. There is &#163;344 million from the Scottish Government and &#163;80 million from Glasgow City Council&#8212;which is an 80:20 split&#8212;and the rest is made up from television revenue and other sources of income. All in all, there is &#163;1 billion of related capital investment in and around Glasgow, which will sustain an additional 1,200 jobs. That is good news in these exceptionally difficult times, and we should commend the successful partnership work between the Parliament and our partners in Glasgow.</p><p>Around 6,500 athletes will be coming to the city from 71 countries, and there will be many more thousands of visitors. I hope that, instead of making a one-off visit to Glasgow and the rest of Scotland, they will be repeat visitors because of the positive experience that they have had, and that they will take that good news and their good experience of Glasgow back overseas.</p><p>Hanzala Malik talked about communities other than the indigenous white communities benefiting from the games. I am working closely with the African and Caribbean Network in Glasgow, at the African and Caribbean centre in the merchant city, which is already looking to build links with the Namibian and Zambian training camps that will be based in Glasgow for the 2012 Olympics. It wants to forge close links with the people from that part of the world who will be coming to Glasgow, including members of athletes&#8217; families, to give them a positive cultural experience right across Glasgow and Scotland. That is happening now, and I would be happy to chat to Hanzala Malik about how he could work in partnership with me to promote that work further. That is a really good success story.</p><p>Lots of good things are happening. I commend Glasgow City Council&#8217;s Commonwealth graduate fund and its Commonwealth jobs fund, just as I commend the additional 1,000 apprentices that were announced for the Glasgow Commonwealth games back in 2009, with another &#163;2 million of investment from the Scottish Government. That is all just the public pound. When Glasgow and the Scottish Government do something good, it is the same public pound that funds it. It is called partnership funding. It is not about who has leveraged in the most cash; it is about working together as a team. I want to think about how we can take that further forward and build on the legacy.</p><p>We have heard about the 15,000 volunteers. I have made this point to David Grevemberg and he has taken it completely on board. Let us make sure that those volunteers are not the same people who volunteer at every volunteering opportunity for the sake of their curriculum vitae. How can we reach into the deprived communities and ethnic communities and get those who are not the usual volunteers to volunteer? That would be something.</p><p>In the little time that I have left, I will mention the cashback for communities scheme. Who knows how much money will be available under that scheme in the future? By definition, that will be based on how much money is confiscated from criminals. I ask that the fund be monitored, reassessed and re-evaluated, with some of the money put into our most deprived communities to support youth workers and youth coaches to ensure that people in deprived communities do not just watch the Commonwealth games on television but are inspired by local coaches, youth leaders and facilities. We must have joined-up thinking so that the legacy is not just the buildings, the repeat visitors to Glasgow and the jobs that are created. We must reach into the heart of our deprived communities and ensure that there is a real Scottish legacy.</p><p>I commend the debate as one of the finest that I have been involved in at the Scottish Parliament during the current session.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657777", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Delivery and Legacy)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have thoroughly enjoyed this high-quality debate so far, and I echo the comments from John Mason and Patricia Ferguson about how inspirational some of the new infrastructure has been.

It acknowledges not just the generous settlement but the more important point that how much money is put in does not necessarily dictate the quality of the outcomes. Today&#8217;s debate is all about ensuring that we get the quality outcomes that are essential.</p><p>Despite the generous settlement, we face financial and demographic challenges. By 2031, the number of people over 65 in Scottish society will have increased by 62 per cent, and every year over the next 10 years there will be an additional 10,000 people who are 75 or older, so it is clear that the Scottish Government is right to have a focus&#8212;although not an exclusive focus&#8212;on integration of health and social care for the elderly as we go forward.</p><p>If someone is to have the best possible life journey as they get older, they need to be supported in their own home, with community health interventions as appropriate. The worst journey would involve unplanned admissions to hospital, prolonged hospital stays, delayed discharge and admission to residential care at an earlier stage than might otherwise have been necessary. We can all agree on that.</p><p>As we drive change, we are right to acknowledge that structural change as an end in itself will not achieve what we want and will be a costly distraction. What we need is cultural transformation in health and social care, underpinned by structural change where appropriate.</p><p>That is why I welcome the statutory reform of community health partnerships, changing them into health and social care partnerships. We can see that that underpinning is necessary if we look at the Glasgow experience, where a pilot project did not work because people would not get out of their cultural silos. I am therefore glad that we are taking that direction.</p><p>We have talked about pooling budgets, but I hope that that actually happens. It is easy to talk about pooling and sharing budgets, but we must insist that it happens. I believe that the mechanism that we have will help to achieve that. In the change fund for older people, which is &#163;300&#160;million over four years, the mechanism is that not one penny can be spent unless it is agreed by local authorities, the NHS and the third sector. That is an excellent model to ensure that change is driven.</p><p>Ahead of the debate, we received various submissions from voluntary sector organisations. The Princess Royal Trust for Carers stated:</p><p>&#8220;We ask for your support to ensure that the impact of these changes for Scotland&#8217;s unpaid carers is fully recognised and that the needs of carers are a central focus in the development of the new integrated structures and the legislation which underpins this work.&#8221;</p><p>The trust wants to ensure that it is &#8220;directly involved&#8221; in the formation of the new legislation and the guidelines that will help to underpin it. I am sure that the cabinet secretary will be able to give reassurances on that. Given that 20 per cent of the change fund will be specifically for carers, it is clear that the Scottish Government is mindful of that issue.</p><p>In future, the environment for carers will become more challenging. I am delighted that the Government is tackling the challenge of self-directed support, which will change the cultural landscape of care at home. The changes will affect the individual&#8217;s choice and how money is spent to support them in their homes. The issue is how we ensure that there are quality care standards at home and how that approach fits into the Scottish Social Services Council&#8217;s qualifications framework.

I checked, and Scotland will receive &#163;6 million in Barnett consequentials as a result of the spending on the UK youth contract, although I am willing to be corrected on that. If we scratch the surface of that youth contract, we see that it will provide 160,000 wage subsidies across the UK&#8212;I point out to Mr Rennie that that is a UK-wide figure&#8212;to encourage the private sector to take on young employees. Each subsidy is worth &#163;2,275. Although that could be welcomed, the initiative raises a number of questions. Will that merely be a wage subsidy for a job that would have been created anyway? Will it artificially create jobs that are not sustainable? How long will a young person need to be employed before the cash payment is made? Will there be a clawback if that subsidy mechanism is abused by employers? Will there be any training requirements? Those are all reasonable questions to ask if we want to ensure that the policy stimulates economic growth, and I hope that those issues can be resolved.</p><p>I contend that it is the Scottish Government that is best placed to resolve those issues in Scotland. I believe that it has a track record in the area. It already has experience of providing a &#163;1,000 subsidy to encourage employers to take on apprentices whose apprenticeship has ceased because of the UK economic crisis. In 2010-11 alone, that has benefited 1,295 apprentices and companies.</p><p>In April 2011, &#163;2.5 million was announced for an extra &#163;1,000 subsidy for companies in Scotland that employ fewer than 50 staff and have particular challenges in taking on extra employees. That is already happening in Scotland, under an SNP Government. Also worth noting is the hugely successful small business bonus scheme, which has helped 85,000 of our very smallest firms to the tune of &#163;1,500, on average&#8212;some have received several thousand pounds more than that.</p><p>If we add to that the opportunities for all scheme for all 16 to 19-year-olds as well as the 25,000 modern apprenticeships a year, it is undoubtedly true that the Scottish Government has created a dynamic network of support for those who are out of work and for our small business sector. Therefore, when more money is being directed at that area, I would suggest that the Scottish Government is best placed to direct how that money is spent. I say that not because I want to start some constitutional turf war but because it just makes sense&#8212;it is the right thing to do, because the Scottish Government has the appropriate track record.</p><p>Of course, we can only do so much to stimulate growth. That is why many of the SNP speakers this afternoon have been talking about capital expenditure as a lever to stimulate growth. Again, Scotland has a track record in that regard, and everyone should listen to the facts. When the Scottish Government accelerated capital expenditure in the construction sector, there was a 22 per cent increase in employment in that sector in Scotland when the equivalent figure was falling by 5 per cent across the UK. Capital acceleration and expenditure works, and the UK Tory-Lib Dem Government should learn that lesson from the Scottish Government.</p><p>I am delighted that we have put our ambitions out there for &#163;60 billion of capital expenditure in the next 20 years.

We have spoken about respite care, on which the SNP Government made progress in its previous term. That progress was substantial, but we recognise that it is still not ample. I could spend the next few minutes comparing different Administrations&#8217; records, but I will not. George Adam rightly reflected the debate&#8217;s useful tone. It is important that, although the minister said that the target for respite weeks had clearly been met, he did not shirk the challenge of the nine local authorities that did not do what they should have done. It is important to have clarity about that and a focus on where changes must happen.</p><p>I have scribbled out a whole bit of my speaking notes about Jackie Baillie&#8217;s comments on respite care in the press in the past week or so. The best thing that I can say is that I praise the Labour members who are present for showing what constructive opposition is all about.</p><p>We have identified that things are going quite well in some areas of Scotland but are rather poor in other areas. My local authority area, Glasgow, is one of the poorer areas, as Glasgow City Council has presided over a 3,000-week reduction in respite care provision. I do not say that deliberately to lay the blame at the council&#8217;s foot. The reasons why some local authorities have not met their targets could be many and varied. However, political leadership to deliver for carers must be not just national but local. Every local authority must have such leadership. Perhaps my local authority has not had that leadership in the past.</p><p>I will say a bit about how the older people&#8217;s services change fund links to the wider preventative spend agenda and to carers. Demographic changes account for a huge amount of the challenges that carers face in relation to primary care issues currently and in dealing with family members&#8217; long-term needs. When the budget is shrinking and cuts are being made, it is still important to look at the bigger picture and to use the money that we have most effectively to change the structure of the support that is available and to improve standards for people who are cared for and carers&#8217; life experience.</p><p>I am delighted that the change fund for the elderly will be &#163;80 million in 2012-13 and that &#163;80 million and &#163;70 million will be available in the subsequent years. I am particularly delighted that 20 per cent of the fund will be targeted on carers for the elderly. I want to think about what that should mean and how a quality outcome from that can be proved. I know that that is difficult to determine, other than through how an individual carer&#8217;s quality of life has improved, which is powerfully important. However, can we expect referrals to acute services in the NHS to reduce because those who are cared for are better supported at home? Can we expect speedier in-patient discharges, as those who are at home are more able to care for loved ones when they leave hospital? Is that a tangible outcome that we can measure?</p><p>Richard Simpson touched on the following issue. When an elderly loved one eventually moves to residential accommodation because they cannot be supported in their own home, will that happen later, after they have had a better quality of life for longer? Can we gather evidence to prove that the change fund money has been well spent? That brings us back to using money to drive change and not just to fill the gaps of overstretched services&#8212;many members have talked about that. Monitoring outcomes is important, as is the link to self-directed support.</p><p>I wanted to say quite a bit about kinship care. I am delighted that comments on kinship care have moved on and that we all support the agenda. I tell newer members that a bit of a bun fight took place over kinship care&#8212;Labour said, &#8220;The SNP ain&#8217;t doing enough,&#8221; and we said, &#8220;Labour didnae do anything.&#8221; The debate is no longer about that; it is now about all of us working together to deliver in kinship carers&#8217; best interests. We must deal with what can be a postcode lottery. Supporting kinship carers is not just about the money. It is about giving them access to local psychological services and supporting the cared-for person as well as the carer. Without adequate psychological support, a carer&#8217;s anxiety for their cared-for child, for example, can be quite stressful.</p><p>We should acknowledge that kinship care payment is a benefit. Through local authorities, the Scottish Government is funding a benefit that will impact on universal credits, perhaps personal independence payments and other benefits. We will have to monitor the effects of that very closely.</p><p>I finish off as we have all done by congratulating members on the consensual tone of the debate and for not shirking the challenges that lie ahead.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655398", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers and Young Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members across the chamber agree on the need to recognise carers&#8217; role further in Scottish society.

Labour fails to tell us that fact. I also acknowledge that Labour&#8217;s fellow London-based colleagues have since given increasingly damaging cuts to Scotland.</p><p>I am disappointed that the Lib Dems are not here this morning to share the blame.</p><p>That point is vital for a number of reasons. First, at the last election, the Labour Party in Scotland refused to commit one additional penny to Scotland&#8217;s NHS, despite being asked repeatedly and directly to do so in interviews with Iain Gray, the party leader. I thought that he, and not Jackie Baillie, spoke for that party. Perhaps she is making a belated leadership bid&#8212;who knows? The SNP Government, however, promised to give NHS boards a real-terms increase and to pass on future Barnett cash consequentials in full. That is why the NHS has seen a 2.5 per cent increase in cash terms and a 0.5 per cent increase in real terms. I shall return to NHS inflation later in my speech, if I have time.</p><p>I appreciate the challenges faced by the NHS, including nurses. My wife is a nurse and she leaves me in no doubt about the challenges that she faces daily. Let the message go out loud and clear, however, that despite the continuing pressures and challenges facing the NHS in the years ahead, the position would have been significantly worse had Labour been re-elected. That is simply a fact. More nats, less cuts. Woe betide us if Jackie Baillie&#8217;s party was in power and she was in charge of the health department, as who knows how many fewer nurses there would be. Do not take my word for it, take Iain Gray&#8217;s, as he refused to pledge any extra cash.</p><p>The same element of Labour&#8217;s motion highlights a second deficiency in Labour&#8217;s thought processes as it focuses on the NHS head count before 2011-12 without giving any thought to the reconfiguration of NHS services. The staff reduction will have been due at least in part to forms of service reconfiguration. That shows that there is an underlying and complete misunderstanding of the workforce management complexities that are at play when we move NHS provision away from acute service delivery into community delivery.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654312", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protecting Scotland&#8217;s NHS"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by telling the Labour Party a few home truths about this morning&#8217;s debate, if the cabinet secretary has left me any to give following her opening speech.

That was for the breaking of a team bus window but, at the time, UEFA said that the discrimination in the songs that Rangers supporters sang was a Scottish problem and that it would not take action because Scottish society should do so. If we fast forward to 2006-07, we find that Rangers were fined &#8364;12,000 after a game with Osasuna in Pamplona after evidence was found on YouTube. UEFA changed its approach. It no longer said that Scotland should deal with the issue; it decided to step in and deal with it. On 10 March 2011, charges of discriminatory behaviour and a &#8364;40,000 fine were upheld in relation to a match against PSV Eindhoven.</p><p>I stress two points. The vast majority of football supporters, including travelling Rangers football supporters, behave impeccably. The reason why I make the point is that we currently have no powers to shine a light on the behaviour of Scottish football supporters abroad, no matter which club they support. I am not willing to have UEFA act when Scottish society and the Parliament can do so. We have a responsibility to do that. That is a positive aspect of the bill.</p><p>I have been lobbied quite a lot about a discussion between Christine Grahame and Professor Devine at the Justice Committee on the distinction between political views, support for terrorist organisations and religious sectarianism. There was a feeling that the bill would target Celtic supporters more than it would target other supporters. I have read that debate and sought clarification on it, and I can say that that is not the case. If I thought that the bill was designed to target one set of supporters over another, I would not support it. The bill is not about targeting supporters but about targeting the problems of discrimination, bigotry and sectarianism in Scotland. Even at this late stage, I hope that the Parliament can come together to do that.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654017", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill (Stage 2 Report)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sure that the member does that.

I am sure that he expects much more consensus in this debate than there was in the previous one. I commend his fortitude in leading from the front bench in that debate while having this members&#8217; business debate before him.</p><p>From my examination of the issue, I see that rogue trading has a fairly set pattern: it involves enticing people into spending money on work that is unnecessary, of poor quality or overpriced. We have known about this widespread problem for a number of years, probably mainly thanks to expos&#233; television shows, which have a great track record in exposing the practice. There has been some action by the Scottish Government and the United Kingdom Government, but there is always room for improvement. That is for sure.</p><p>I know that James Kelly agrees with me that every member of the Parliament has an interest in tackling rogue traders. They are the cause of one of the more common complaints that we get from our constituents. It does not surprise me that home improvements&#8212;in particular, roofing&#8212;still top the list. They were the subject of 30 per cent of complaints about rogue traders in the UK to the Office of Fair Trading in 2010.</p><p>I have heard of one company quoting a cost of &#163;5,000 for roof repairs that another quote said would cost just a few hundred pounds. Very few of us have the expertise to argue about the validity of a contractor&#8217;s claims. Of course, it is usually sensible to shop around and to look for a number of quotes&#8212;perhaps three&#8212;to avoid being ripped off. We must all give out that clear message, particularly to vulnerable people, who are more at risk from rogue traders.</p><p>As we have said, the elderly need to know whom they can and cannot trust when they look for key works to be done in their homes. Rogue traders are ruthless and make good money through profiting from other people&#8217;s misery. They must be stopped where we can do that.</p><p>Hard selling has become normalised in the sales culture. Sometimes, there is a fine line between a hard-nosed salesperson at the door who is a bit too pushy and inappropriate selling by rogue traders. I put in that mix energy companies that look for people to switch tariffs, which might fall into the rogue trader category&#8212;we must think about that. We must find a way of forcing the adoption of best practice and not just hope for it.</p><p>I thank James Kelly for securing the debate. Members&#8217; business debates are important to awareness raising at large. Public vigilance can sometimes do much more than Government or local authority action can to stop rogue traders, so it is important to publicise what can be done.</p><p>We must be mindful that consumer protection is an important policy area that the Parliament does not cover fully and over which it does not have full control. I assure Mr Kelly that I will not use the debate as an excuse to talk about constitutional wranglings, but it is fair to say that not all the powers to improve the situation lie with the Parliament. I will leave it sitting at that.</p><p>We must raise public awareness. There is nothing legitimate about traders who are just after a quick buck, but there is everything legitimate about traders who just want to do business. That is why we must consider accreditation schemes. The existing ones are voluntary, but we must consider a compulsory accreditation scheme. I am not one for regulation for regulation&#8217;s sake, but we have moved to formal regulation of a variety of other matters, such as factoring and tenancy deposits, when the evidence has supported that.</p><p>I thank Mr Kelly for bringing the debate to the chamber. I might not be able to stay until the end, so I apologise if I have to nip off.

I very much welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s view that the Welfare Reform Bill is not fit for purpose and would be rejected.</p><p>I want to highlight some of the potentially devastating harmful consequences of the benefit reforms that the UK Government is bringing to Scotland. In doing so, I thank the many voluntary sector organisations whose excellent briefings have been helpful. The Citizens Advice Bureaux Scotland briefing provided case studies, one of which is the example of a 40-year-old man in Glasgow who is claiming incapacity benefit and disability living allowance at the lower rate and is in receipt of housing benefit for a social tenancy. If that man is considered fit for work following reassessment and is also affected by housing benefit cuts, he could lose anywhere between &#163;60 and &#163;120 every week, which is not small change in any one&#8217;s book.</p><p>The reforms will have absolutely horrific consequences if they go through as they stand. There are over 190,000 incapacity benefit recipients in Scotland, who have every right to be worried by the reforms. The UK Government is introducing a cocktail of cuts with its Welfare Reform Bill, and its ingredients amount to a savage attack on many of the most vulnerable groups in our society. We must do all that we can as a Parliament to fend off those cuts in Scotland, although in reality this Parliament is not fully equipped to do so. The Welfare Reform Bill started from a UK Government position of cutting cash at any cost, and the attack on the most vulnerable in our society was a price worth paying for it. Let me be clear: it is not a price worth paying for the SNP or for Scotland.</p><p>To base any reform of disability benefit on a view that there should be an automatic cut of 20 per cent in that budget is not even a remotely subtle way of disguising the cuts as reforms&#8212;it just does not wash. As disability benefit is changed to personal independence payments, a combination of a 20 per cent cut and the removal of entitlement from those on lower-rate DLA is estimated to mean that 75,000 people&#8212;one in three working-age claimants&#8212;will lose their entitlement.

Some may say that an unoccupied bedroom is not an efficient use of resources, and that reducing housing benefit is a way to encourage tenants to find a more suitable home, but I fundamentally disagree with that. That imposed benefit cut from Westminster takes no account, for instance, of the fact that 44 per cent of tenants in the social rented sector require a one-bedroom house but only 24 per cent stay in one because the housing stock does not actually exist. The figures just do not stack up.</p><p>The proposed reforms could, for example, force a long-standing tenant in Springburn with a disability to move out of their home and seek a smaller property, perhaps in Castlemilk at the other end of Glasgow. That is just not satisfactory. They would lose their spare room, in which perhaps a carer would stay to provide support. They would also lose their entire support network of family and friends and would face social isolation. That is, of course, if alternative accommodation even existed. As has been clearly stated, it just does not.</p><p>Housing benefit reforms will mean that disabled people and others will have to use a greater chunk of shrinking benefits to pay for rent&#8212;that is not an acceptable choice. It will leave social housing providers in the invidious and horrible position of either dropping their rents, which they would not be able to afford to do, or pursuing vulnerable tenants for rent arrears, which is not a position that anyone should be in. However, the UK welfare reforms will bring that position to Scotland. We must prevent that.</p><p>I am delighted that we will give robust scrutiny to the LCM at the Health and Sport Committee, although I wish that we did not have to do so. Such is the detail of scrutiny that is needed that perhaps, as voluntary sector organisations have suggested, we need an ad hoc committee of the Scottish Parliament to be set up, in order that we have an adequate vehicle for scrutiny of the devastating proposals. We will have to wait and see, but we certainly have a moral duty to speak out against the UK benefit reforms and the direct impact on Scotland of changes to housing benefit, council tax benefit, the social fund and the use of passported benefits to gain access to devolved entitlements. The matter is complex and should be dealt with by the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>My heart sinks when I think that however much Scottish Parliament committees scrutinise the proposals and say how wrong they are, we will have no power to stand against them.

We can see very quickly what the impact of cutting that support to 70 per cent will be&#8212;Malcolm Chisholm fleshed that out with some figures. I hope against hope that the UK Government will look again at that matter and realise that the long-term effects of what it proposes will be completely counterproductive, both socially and economically.</p><p>Save the Children believes that to guarantee 80 per cent of childcare costs under the universal credit would cost &#163;405 million across the UK, which would represent a mere 0.45 per cent increase in the total welfare budget. I suspect that that would be a wise investment, given the long-term effects of having children grow up in fully benefits-dependent households. We are only too well aware of the damaging intergenerational poverty that can be created. There are communities in Scotland that are still benefits dependent because no support was put in back in the 1980s. We do not want to see that happen at this time of crisis in the UK economy. That is an important thing to say.</p><p>In the information provided by Save the Children, one of my constituents describes better than I could the problem that parents face. They say:</p><p>&#8220;I feel that the government is making it extremely difficult for ordinary people with children to earn an honest living. The current situation is encouraging people to give up work and go onto benefits as many people are better off that way. This is surely not the correct way to go about things. I enjoy working and would not be happy on benefits, however this is becoming increasingly difficult to manage.&#8221;</p><p>If that individual finds themselves on the dole, perhaps their grandchildren will think that being on the dole is the normal existence for human beings&#8212;it is not the normal existence; we have to support people in employment and into employment.</p><p>There are challenges not just for the UK Government, but for the Scottish Government and for this Parliament. I do not deny that the extension of entitlement to two-year-olds is a huge challenge in the current financial climate, as is providing out-of-school care for five-to-14-year-olds. However, something that we could achieve more speedily is getting the commitment to provide 15 hours a week for three and four-year-olds to work better. I do not think that local authorities are flexible enough in their approach and I do not think that they use partnership nurseries as effectively as they could do. Some people just cannot take up the entitlement because they cannot put their son or daughter into a nursery at 10 o&#8217;clock in the morning, leave their job and pick them up again at half past 12. That just cannot be done, particularly if people do not have wider family support. We must look at reforming that area to make it work better for families.</p><p>I will finish by looking at the cost of childcare. Costs are too high, but I was interested to learn that costs in Scotland are higher than they are in the rest of the UK. I have spoken to Save the Children about the issue, and I wonder whether we are comparing apples with oranges rather than apples with apples. I want us to look at the quality of the childcare and the educational experience that are provided for children when they start to follow the childcare pathway. It might be the case that the like-for-like costs are quite similar, but that, because of the involvement of more highly skilled staff, a better outcome in qualitative terms is obtained in Scotland. That might explain the differential, but more efforts need to be made to look into that.</p><p>I again commend Jamie Hepburn for bringing the debate to the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651853", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Affordable Childcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Jamie Hepburn for bringing this motion to the chamber, as it raises a very worthy issue.

He takes an international approach to the promotion of peace and does his bit to seek an end to nuclear proliferation. He has been tireless in those efforts over the years, whether at the United Nations or through the variety of networks across the globe in which he has been involved. I never thought that I would say it, but he really has gone global. We should never underestimate the amount of time that he puts into those roles, and in that respect he is an excellent ambassador for the peace movement. Such is the extent of his travels that he is also an excellent ambassador for Scotland. I will back off now; that is enough praise for Bill Kidd. I will move on to some other stuff, but I thought it was important to get that on the record.</p><p>My first real hands-on experience of nuclear weapons came about because I come from the Vale of Leven, and Faslane is within those general environs. I remember very well campaigners such as Les Robertson and Jim Bolan at the Faslane peace camp doing their bit on the local front line. Irrespective of what people think about nuclear weapons&#8212;the majority of members are against them but a minority still support them&#8212;we should never forget the selflessness of people who protest against weapons of mass destruction every day, even when it is not fashionable to do so. I put on record my praise for those individuals.</p><p>I want to talk about peace and nuclear weapons. I know about the hypocrisy whereby we think it acceptable for certain nations to have weapons of mass destruction but are hell-bent on preventing others from having theirs. Of course, the answer is that no one should have them at all. The more important point for me as a Scottish person is that we do not need nuclear weapons to start a war, although they represent the worst-case scenario and are the driving force behind a lot of wars.</p><p>On the power to go to war, as a Scottish citizen, I feel that it is a moral dereliction of duty that the decision whether Scotland should engage in a war is not in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s hands. How can we promote peace when we cannot prevent our Scottish sons and daughters from going to war, whether illegal or otherwise?</p><p>I know that there is no constitutional consensus in the chamber around independence. I strive not to be political about that. Although it would be possible for an independent Scotland to be involved in illegal wars&#8212;independence is not a magic wand&#8212;I believe with all my heart that we are best placed for that not to happen should we become independent. Irrespective of their constitutional views, I pay tribute to members of all parties in Parliament for what they have done to promote peace.</p><p>John Finnie made the important point that it is not enough just to object to wars; we have to positively promote peace both to ensure that we have stable communities, a stable country and a stable international community, and to make wars less likely to happen. That is about the nurturing of peace, which is vital.</p><p>Who is to say that Libya, pre-conflict, was a peaceful nation? Who is to say that Afghanistan or Iraq is peaceful? Who is to say that Libya, post-conflict, will be peaceful? Who knows what human rights abuses might continue irrespective of which regime or Government is in charge? Indeed, that very point has already been well made.</p><p>The best thing this Parliament can do to promote peace is to have a big vision of connection with the international community. The more barriers we break down as internationalists and the more connections we make with other countries and other organisations across the globe, the more we will get an international understanding and international co-operation.

Its Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated higher corporation tax revenues by 2013-14 than those at the pre-recession peak. It is staggering that, when the UK Government examines cutting corporation tax at a pan-UK level it does an analysis that builds in the benefits of growth, but when the work is done on a purely Scottish basis, the UK Government scurries around looking for a worst-case scenario and stretching the credibility of its projections to breaking point.</p><p>Therefore, let us have a look at some other projections. Scottish Government modelling work has indicated that setting corporation tax at 20 per cent can create 27,000 jobs and increase economic output by 1.4 per cent, with a 2 per cent uplift in overall investment. It has been suggested that Northern Ireland&#8217;s model will create 58,000 jobs, which is very powerful indeed. If Northern Ireland is to have those powers, why not Scotland? Recent work by the American Economic Journal shows that, in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, a 10 per cent reduction in corporation tax has typically raised investment rates by 2 per cent and boosted company registrations by 20 per cent. So why not in Scotland?</p><p>There is compelling evidence that the power to vary corporation tax levels can be a significant economic boost. Rather than debating whether we should have the economic powers, our nation&#8217;s Parliament should be debating how we use them once we have them. That is the debate for this place. To suggest that we should not have the power to do so is clearly constitutionally incompetent and underlines the democratic deficit that we face in trying to take Scotland and our economy forward.

We get a block grant&#8212;that is what we want to change and that is what he stands in the way of. I am delighted that the First Minister in his statement on our programme for government saw that big picture, even if Mr Findlay did not.</p><p>It was important that the First Minister made a unified case across the chamber for more powers for this Parliament while keeping central the bigger picture of our preferred option of independence&#8212;more powers to grow our economy and to reinvest that wealth for the betterment of all Scottish people. I caution people who would go only part of the way towards more powers for Scotland&#8212;the Calman generation, if you will&#8212;that having the financial powers to grow our economy, even in a very limited way, without the ability to collect the wealth that would flow in the face of a shrinking block grant would lead to financial ruin. There is no point in our having the powers to grow the economy unless we can collect the wealth that we generate. All that we would have would be a shrinking block grant and debt to pay off as a result. So, let us be careful when we consider the powers that Scotland should have and let us ensure that we get them right.</p><p>The big picture is important to our day-to-day lives&#8212;we have only to look at housing to see that, as we heard earlier. As a member of the Government, of course I want to talk about our successes in housing. I want to mention the &#163;1.7&#160;billion that was spent on affordable housing between 2008 and 2011. I want to talk about the right-to-buy restrictions that have helped, about the national housing trust and about the &#163;100&#160;million that has been spent on the more than 3,000 council houses that have been built under this SNP Administration compared to the six that were built under the previous Labour-Lib Dem Administration.</p><p>I also want to talk about progress. I want to talk about the council tax levy on empty homes and the potential &#163;30&#160;million that that could raise for local authorities besides having the benefit of bringing more homes into use for affordable housing. I want to talk about independence and more powers for Scotland. If we had the borrowing powers, we would not be just tinkering at the edges of affordable housing but would deal with our social housing problem fully. We cannot do that without those full powers.</p><p>Let us look at what borrowing powers can do. When we saw the front loading of capital investment for housing in this country, we also saw an 11 per cent fall in construction unemployment at a time when the level of unemployment was rising in England. That kind of investment works, but it is sustainable only with the real powers of an independent Parliament. People who tell me that independence does not matter to the people of Scotland should tell that to the plumbers, the sparkies, the brickies, the joiners and the labourers whom we put into work using the powers that we have. They should tell that to the people who are currently on the dole queue whom we could put back to work if we had independence for this country. That is what the big picture is all about. Our day-to-day programme is important, although we are delivering with one hand tied behind our back.</p><p>Another aspect of the programme before us is care for the elderly and other vulnerable groups. Jackie Baillie talked about regulation of care homes. None of us would ever make light of the tragedy that happened at the Elsie Inglis care home or, indeed, of the financial meltdown that happened at Southern Cross Healthcare. We should try to find a consensual way in which to pursue those issues. There is a strong need to analyse the financial assumptions that underpin private sector nursing homes. There is also a strong need for a presumption that care homes will continue to operate irrespective of those financial assumptions, whereby the state or the voluntary sector steps in to ensure that the care is still delivered.</p><p>However, there is a real danger that, if we try to regulate on that, we will impinge on reserved issues relating to trading and other matters. When a business goes belly-up, the banks will have the first call on its assets unless we can change that. We must consider the overlapping reserved issues and we cannot act with one hand tied behind our back: even if Jackie Baillie is nodding to say that we could, we could not.</p><p>Fiona McLeod spoke yesterday about the proposed bill on self-directed support, which I very much welcome. There will be challenges in it and some local authorities will have to consider how to disaggregate some provision&#8212;certainly, the ones that have been more reluctant to deliver self-directed support. If a local authority provides a service in someone&#8217;s home for three hours a week but that person tells the local authority that they want to opt out of that service and the local authority has hundreds of care workers who are the default providers of that care, self-directed support can be seen as being threatening to local authorities that do not go in the right direction. However, they should see it as an opportunity to deliver for the people who most need that care. I heard Fiona McLeod&#8217;s speech yesterday and I know that she has direct experience of that. I hope that we can come together as a Parliament on that proposed bill on self-directed support.</p><p>I also hope that we will continue to come together as a Parliament to tackle the scourge of sectarianism. Politicians cannot legislate to end sectarianism, but neither can we stick our heads in the sand. I do not know whether the bill that is going through Parliament will transform Scotland by tackling the scourge of sectarianism. What I do know, though, is that it is not enough not to try. For too long, Parliament has buried its head in the sand. I hope that we come together to sort that. The recent jury judgment for a high-profile case points to the way in which we have to change cultural attitudes&#8212;and not just west of Scotland cultural attitudes.

Denominational schooling does not foster sectarianism, but intolerance of denominational schooling can do so. We witnessed a little of that intolerance in Mr Lamont&#8217;s speech this morning.</p><p>I stress two other points in relation to tackling sectarianism. First, despite some of the comments that we have heard in the chamber today, sectarianism is not specifically a west-of-Scotland problem&#8212;that is just wrong. Secondly, sectarianism at football grounds does not occur only with some Celtic or Rangers supporters&#8212;it happens to varying degrees with different football supporters at different clubs across Scotland.

There is a reasonable debate to be had about that, but there is no black and white here&#8212;it is a judgment call. On balance, I agree that we should be fleet of foot and act quickly to get the bill on the statute book before the start of the football season. On balance, that judgment is correct. We need to focus on the start of the new season. That is why the bill has been introduced now.</p><p>I turn to how the police and the courts will use the bill&#8212;specifically, its interpretation. I strongly believe that having a list of approved or proscribed songs or actions would be unworkable and unhelpful, no matter how long we take to scrutinise the bill.

Under common law, breach of the peace is</p><p>&#8220;conduct which presents as genuinely alarming and disturbing, in its context, to any reasonable person.&#8221;</p><p>There are no specific lists of conduct that falls into that category.

My members&#8217; business debate relates to how those social ills impact on our national game and how they sometimes create havoc in our communities. However, just as important, it is about how society works together to cure Scotland of those social ills. It is an opportunity for MSPs to take an active stand against sectarianism and racism and to pledge to do all we can to take Scotland forward.</p><p>It might seem to some that public condemnation of such unacceptable behaviour is stating the obvious, but those people are wrong. My constituents in Glasgow&#8212;our constituents across Scotland&#8212;will rightly ask us as individual MSPs to speak out against bigotry and racism wherever and whenever they raise their head. To stay silent plays into the hands of the bigots and the racists.</p><p>I know that legislation from the Scottish Government on this matter is imminent. It is only right that we give that legislation a fair wind. This debate is not about the legislation. All I will say on that is that I accept that such legislation must be focused and fleet of foot for the purpose of having it in place for the start of the new football season. However, I would welcome further, more detailed legislation at a later date if it became apparent that it was needed.</p><p>We should not tolerate it when professional football managers in Scotland are sent bullets through the post; there is no place for such behaviour. Were bullets sent to Neil Lennon because he is from Northern Ireland, because he is the Celtic manager, because he is a Catholic or because he is clearly a passionate former player and now an equally passionate football coach? Were they sent because of flashpoints in previous football games?</p><p>On one level, it is absolutely irrelevant why the bullets were sent. No person going about their job of work brings on themselves the threats and abuse with which Mr Lennon has had to cope. There are no mitigating factors to justify bigotry, racism, threats and intimidation. It makes no difference whether it is directed towards high-profile individuals or ordinary members of the public. Likewise, our former Deputy Presiding Officer does not encourage threats towards her person because she wears a football top on her last day at work in the Scottish Parliament. There are no mitigating circumstances.</p><p>However, I have heard some in wider Scottish society make comments such as, &#8220;I know it shouldn&#8217;t happen, but what do they expect if that&#8217;s how they behave? They bring it on themselves&#8221;. If we are honest, we have all heard those comments. No one&#8212;absolutely no one&#8212;brings that on themselves. I reiterate once more that there are no mitigating circumstances when abuse&#8212;verbal or physical&#8212;is directed towards any other human being. We must not unwittingly give succour to the bigots and racists.</p><p>My motion stresses partnership working. On that front, I very much welcome the on-going work that has followed the anti-sectarianism summit. However, I want to ensure that the partnership working does not involve just the usual suspects talking to one another, as well intentioned as that clearly is. It must be wider and reach every part of civic Scotland.</p><p>I believe that bigotry and racism often overlap. We live in a society in which&#8212;wrongly&#8212;the distinction between, for example, a Pakistani and a Muslim person often blurs. In Scotland, that overlap and blurring sometimes relate to Catholicism and Irish ethnicity, and that is also wrong. For me, prejudice is prejudice, irrespective of the label, and it must be stamped out with equal vigour. For instance, why is it that we rightly celebrate the cultural traditions of third-generation Pakistanis or Bangladeshi families as enriching Scottish society, and yet some in Scottish society do not extend the same welcome to our Irish diaspora? We must not shy away from those awkward questions.</p><p>Of course we need a strategy to tackle those issues as they present themselves in and around football, but we need a wider social strategy. We need to ensure that any discussion is inclusive and challenging. This is society&#8217;s problem, not football&#8217;s problem.</p><p>That is not to say that football does not have to put its house in order: it does, and I am confident that it will. Football is a key part of the solution because that sport unites us more than it divides us. That is why the Show Racism the Red Card charity has been vital in challenging racism throughout Europe and working with football effectively to do so. I hope that its sister organisation, Show Bigotry the Red Card, will be able to do likewise&#8212;indeed, it is giving a presentation in committee room 2 after this debate, and I hope that some members will be able to come along.</p><p>I said that this debate was about taking a stand&#8212;a clear public stand&#8212;against bigotry and anti-Irish racism, and it is, but I also said that it is about partnership working. I am proud that our Scottish Government is showing leadership, but that leadership is a personal responsibility for every one of our MSPs in our constituencies and regions throughout Scotland. Just as it is unacceptable to ridicule someone because of their colour, it must be unacceptable to ridicule someone because of their religion or their Irish ethnic background.</p><p>If we say &#8220;Zero tolerance&#8221; and we live and believe that in our communities, we can truly change Scottish society. That is a responsibility that I am proud to shoulder for the next five years, and I ask my fellow MSPs to do likewise.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648581", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sectarianism and Anti-Irish Racism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is essential that politicians of all parties state clearly and categorically that we will provide active and vocal support in Scotland&#8217;s fight to tackle sectarianism and anti-Irish racism.

I also welcome the elevation of Michael Matheson and look forward to working constructively with the front-bench team.</p><p>It is important that Nicola Sturgeon has health as well as cities in her portfolio, and it is particularly appropriate given the significant health needs and inequalities that are faced by many in our home city of Glasgow. It is important to say that health is improving in the round, but significant inequalities endure. For instance, men in Glasgow&#8217;s north and east community health partnership area still live for eight years less than those in East Dunbartonshire, which is not acceptable. I therefore read with great interest the submission from the British Medical Association, which is keen for additional support to be given to general practices in areas with the greatest need. I am keen to hear more about how the Scottish Government seeks to ensure that there is an appropriate resource balance in relation to healthcare provision between general practices in communities with very different health needs.</p><p>I very much hope that, as cities minister, Nicola Sturgeon will look at whether further positive health and social care interventions can be made in order to close the health inequality gap, building on the work that has already started with the equally well initiative. I know that work is in progress in that area.</p><p>The reintroduction of minimum pricing legislation will be particularly important in addressing health and wider social concerns in our cities.

It will provide the young mothers and fathers I know in deprived areas of Glasgow with intensive support for six months before their baby is born and for up to two years afterwards. It has been successfully rolled out in Edinburgh and Dundee, and I look forward to hearing more about what will happen in my city of Glasgow.</p><p>Turning to the regeneration of our cities, I believe that it is true that our cities are drivers of the country&#8217;s economic wealth. For instance, I welcome Glasgow&#8217;s key role as Scotland&#8217;s premier retail and conference destination and its growing significance as a financial and renewable energy centre. However, in seeking to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s cities are key drivers of our economy, we must not forget the long-standing communities outwith the city centre that suffer from the significant health inequalities that have already been mentioned, as well as from high levels of unemployment that are way above the Scottish and UK averages.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in the first debate in the new parliamentary session to have a focus on Scotland&#8217;s cities.

Those are the four worst areas in the country, and three of the four are in the north of our city. That is simply not acceptable, and the cabinet secretary now has a crucial cross-Government remit in ensuring that appropriate investment is made not just in Glasgow&#8217;s city centre but in the outer areas, such as those in the north of the city that I have mentioned.</p><p>I have two suggestions for the cabinet secretary. First, I am keen to discuss with her how Glasgow can get an appropriate share of the &#163;50 million of the joint European support for sustainable investment in city areas&#8212;or JESSICA&#8212;fund, which is specifically for urban regeneration. Such moves will be crucial not just to regeneration and anti-poverty strategies but in promoting a pro-health approach in our city.</p><p>Secondly&#8212;and perhaps more significant&#8212;I understand that John Swinney is currently considering four new enterprise zones for Scotland, a matter that has been brought into sharp focus by the UK Government&#8217;s decision to progress 21 such zones in England. I fully appreciate the complexity of ensuring that in such zones there is a balance between attracting new businesses to locate and grow in the area and displacing business from elsewhere in Scotland, but I have every confidence that John Swinney can iron out such complexities.</p><p>Given her cities remit, I seek the cabinet secretary&#8217;s support in ensuring that deprived areas in Scotland&#8217;s cities get an opportunity to be designated as one of those enterprise zones. Given the very real problems of ill health, deprivation and unemployment, I believe that the case for exploring the prospect of north Glasgow being one of the four enterprise zones is powerful, and I am arranging for early meetings with John Swinney and Glasgow City Council to explore the idea further. By tackling poverty and joblessness we can promote positive health in our communities. Our cities are central to economic prosperity across Scotland, and we must ensure that our deprived communities share in the wealth creation that is evident in our city centres. Such moves are vital to public health.</p><p>I very much welcome Nicola Sturgeon&#8217;s new cities remit, I look forward to working with her and her front-bench team in the years ahead and I hope that we can make progress with the issues that I have raised this afternoon.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I completely agree.

That is only right. I am sure that the Scottish Government will welcome that scrutiny. I want to ensure that we look not only at what we can achieve in the short term in relation to the issue but at how much we could achieve given the right conditions. For absolute clarity, I note that the right conditions include additional powers for the Parliament. I will say more about that later in my speech, but I want to begin by saying a bit about the here and now.</p><p>I am delighted that the cabinet secretary has reinforced his commitment to the small business bonus scheme. I see the scheme&#8217;s effect on the ground locally&#8212;in Maryhill Road in Glasgow, in Springburn shopping centre and in the town centres of Rutherglen and Cambuslang. I could list business after business that has stayed afloat simply because of the scheme. There are 64,000 businesses that no longer pay rates. The scheme has made a real difference in difficult times. I am delighted that the cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment to it has been reiterated here this afternoon.</p><p>I am also delighted that we are going further. The small business jobs plan seems rather exciting. It is eye watering to think that there are 200,000 one-person companies in this country. Think of the jobs that would be created here if just a small fraction of those individuals were able to take on a second employee. I am delighted that the small business jobs plan will look at ways of supporting them to do that by showing them how to get through the complexities of the tax system, how to design and frame contracts, and how to get additional finance to make a business grow. The plan is an essential job creation measure. I am delighted to see it.</p><p>I am also delighted to see the re-emphasis on investing in our skills base and the 100,000 training opportunities per year that the Scottish Government will roll out. Of course I am delighted by the 25,000 apprenticeships, but I am also delighted to hear more information on flexible and non-age-specific apprenticeships and other training opportunities, which are vital. In the past, some people have felt frozen out of training opportunities. It is important that we widen the possibilities and opportunities that are available to them.</p><p>I will be closely following the progress of the proposed procurement bill. It is important for local authorities and the public sector throughout Scotland to get best value through the procurement process. I am reminded of the Scottish Futures Trust&#8217;s first annual outturn report, which said that, over the lifetime of contracts negotiated in the first year, there would be a saving to the taxpayer in Scotland of &#163;100 million. It is important to get procurement right, and the procurement bill can do that.</p><p>The procurement bill can also do much more. We can ensure that local jobs form a key part of the procurement process. I hear time and again&#8212;from the construction industry and right across the board&#8212;that, because of procurement rules and European regulations, some people are squeezed out when attempts are made to fill vacancies locally. It would be good to get more information on that.</p><p>We need to do more to leverage in cash. Tax increment finance and joint European support for sustainable investment in city areas are exciting developments, but mention should also be made of the work that Alex Neil did as a minister in leveraging additional cash into the housing sector. I hope to hear good news soon about UK pension funds investing in the Scottish social housing sector. I am sure that the whole Parliament can get on board and support a can-do attitude on the part of the Scottish Government in that regard.</p><p>We must think ahead for the longer term. We must ensure that, when the economy grows&#8212;and grows strongly&#8212;again, everyone in society benefits. Parts of society never benefited from the previous good times, and inequality endured. As we create wealth for all in society, we must ensure that everyone can access it.</p><p>We must be honest: the majority of members believe that the UK Government has taken a wrong-headed approach to economic recovery in this country: where it would rather cut to bolster the economy, we would rather invest. Joe FitzPatrick illustrated how such investment works. For the financial year 2010-11, &#163;3.3 billion of capital projects have sustained or created 50,000 jobs in the Scottish economy. Investment works.</p><p>However, with UK cuts coming to Scotland and with our desire to invest, the existing funding gap is accentuated. We must borrow to invest, and I am delighted that members on all sides of the chamber now agree&#8212;I think&#8212;that we must go further than the Calman proposals on borrowing.</p><p>The thing about borrowing is that the money that is borrowed has to be paid back. My question is: who retains the wealth that is created when we borrow to invest? The Scottish Government will take the borrowing risk, but who will get the borrowing reward?</p><p>Every time the Scottish Government invests and takes someone off the dole or stops someone going on the dole, that brings a cash benefit to the UK Exchequer. Every time someone is put into employment, they pay tax and national insurance into the UK Exchequer. We borrow to invest, and we bring a cash benefit to the UK Exchequer. Every time someone feels confident enough to spend an extra pound in the shop, the 20 per cent in VAT&#8212;part of their spending power&#8212;brings a cash benefit to the UK Exchequer. Every time someone fills up their tank with petrol&#8212;because they can now afford to&#8212;it brings a tax benefit to the UK Exchequer.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In this debate, we will hear much from all sides of the chamber about whether the Scottish Government&#8217;s methods of focusing on economic recovery and job creation are working.

By more responsive I mean not just better service provision in general, but also an integrated system that will promote modal shift from car to bus and other forms of public transport.</p><p>I will illustrate my point using the example of my commute. On my return from Parliament in Edinburgh, I get off the train at Queen Street station and have a variety of choices of ways in which to make my way back to my home in Maryhill. I can go for a 10 or 15-minute walk to the bus stop and wait in the city centre for an indeterminate period of time for a bus that will provide a debatable quality of service. Alternatively, I can jump in a taxi&#8212;in bad weather, when nights are dark and when time is short, I have done that, but for many of my constituents that is an unrealistic option, due to cost, and, further, it does not meet our desire to effect a modal shift in commuter culture. My third option is to get on the subway at Buchanan Street, disembark at St George&#8217;s Cross and get a bus to Maryhill from there&#8212;indeed, when I am not pressed for time, that is my preferred option, and it represents joined-up and clever public transport provision.</p><p>That option best sums up an integrated transport network&#8212;a journey using train, subway and bus seamlessly. That is the vision that we all strive and aspire to achieve. However, the issue with that option is that the infrequency and the overcrowding of the subway service make it an undesirable option for many. However, that will all change, and I am proud that an SNP Government has committed public funding to the full modernisation of the subway system. I am proud of how the SNP has delivered for Glasgow on that front.</p><p>That financial commitment will deliver new rolling stock, refurbished stations and an integrated ticketing network across all public modes of transport. That will drive integrated provision, with buses at new key interchanges, such as St George&#8217;s Cross, and buses being taken outwith the city centre and not having to start their journey in the city centre in the first place. That is what this is all about.</p><p>I see progress already, with Glasgow City Council and SPT moving to introduce a statutory quality partnership scheme for all bus services within the city boundaries. It will consider routes, waiting areas, emissions and air quality, under the current regulatory powers that exist.</p><p>We all need that can-do attitude to public transport. When Labour MSPs were standing outside underground stations with petitions for subway modernisation, I was meeting the former transport minister, Stewart Stevenson, with that can-do attitude, and when they were putting out alarmist press releases, I was meeting the new transport minister, Keith Brown. When they were talking complete nonsense, I was meeting the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, John Swinney, to discuss how we could secure financial funding. When they were full of bluff, bluster and alarm, we were delivering on public transport for Glasgow. The SNP has a can-do attitude, and we will deliver further using the regulatory powers that we have and by working in partnership with bus companies and representatives of other forms of transport.</p><p>I urge members to support the amendment in the name of Keith Brown.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bus Services Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to talk about ways in which we can make bus services more responsive to the needs of the communities that I represent in Glasgow.

Given the significant cuts of &#163;800 million that have been made to Scotland&#8217;s capital budget in the coming financial year alone by the United Kingdom Government, it will be ever more difficult to meet housing need within the public sector alone.</p><p>We do not want it to be that way, but we have to acknowledge that it is. Therefore, we need the private sector and we have to work in partnership with it. As has been pointed out, most private sector landlords are excellent. Our discussions with the Scottish Association of Landlords show that those at the top of their game in the private sector can be a power for good in meeting housing need. That is why the bill must ensure that we regulate effectively to achieve the highest standards. Regulation under the bill will allow us to move a significant way towards doing that.</p><p>The lack of prosecution of unregistered landlords has concerned us all for a while. The only prosecution that we have had of an unregistered landlord resulted in a derisory fine being handed out. The issue has been mentioned, but it is important to reinforce the point that there is a need for better and more effective prosecution and more significant fines. I therefore welcome the increase in the maximum fine for unregistered landlords to &#163;50,000, which I hope will drive change, although time will tell on that. I look forward to seeing the guidelines that the minister has talked about on best practice in securing prosecutions and engaging in enforcement.</p><p>Fines that are given to unregistered landlords should be retained in Scotland and used to pay for enforcement and the regulation of the private rented sector. The money should not simply flow to the London Exchequer, as currently happens. To put it bluntly, why should Scotland&#8217;s local authorities have to pay to enforce regulation while any profit&#8212;if I can use that terminology&#8212;from court fines travels south? Perhaps that is an argument for another day, but if prosecutions become increasingly successful, as we all hope that they will, that situation would surely stick in the craw of Scottish councils. Regulating the sector is hardly inexpensive, but local authorities get no cash benefit to reinvest in that area. I draw the distinction that the cash benefit would not cross-subsidise anything else; the money would come back to pay for effective regulation of the sector.</p><p>I welcome the introduction of landlord registration numbers, which should be a driver for consumer change, as I have said previously. I would hope that no one would buy a car that was not MOT&#8217;d, so why do people move into houses that are unregistered and do not have all the safety features that they should? We must drive that consumer change and ensure that there is consumer responsibility.</p><p>I would like to know more about how the tenancy deposit scheme, which would secure deposits for tenants should they leave a landlord, will work. I am interested in whether registered landlords will be the only people who will be able to opt into that scheme. I would also like to know how the benefits system will interact with landlord registration. The minister has spoken about considering greater tenancy security for social tenants in the private sector to meet affordable housing need. There is a lot of work to do as we move forward. I cannot say whether the housing minister in the next Scottish Government will be male or female, but I am content with the one that we have. Of course, I suspect that appointing the next housing minister will be Alex Salmond&#8217;s job as First Minister.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647273", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by saying something that I think that we all agree on: the private rented sector must become increasingly important in the provision of good-quality, affordable housing.

It is the sign of a good Government that priorities are decided on the results that make Scotland a better place to live in, and with recorded crime at a 32-year low, I tend to think that most people in Scotland would prefer policies that focus on protecting their rights as citizens to live free from the horrors of crime over cutting police. The crime statistics tell me that there are about 1,100 extra police officers since 2007. They are simply not expendable, so a responsible Scottish Government has to take steps to maintain those numbers.</p><p>I welcome this debate, as it is of course the stated intention of the Government to listen and to consult widely before enacting any proposals.

In particular, I put on record my thanks to Patricia Ferguson, the member who has driven the bill forward, and the Minister for Housing and Communities, Alex Neil, for the way in which they have conducted themselves, in particular at stage 2, when the bill was improved in a positive fashion, with partnership between the Government and the member in charge. This afternoon, at stage 3, Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendments have once again involved working constructively with the Government to make the bill as good and watertight as it can be. That is to be welcomed.</p><p>There has been such consensus on the policy intention behind the bill that a feeling of d&#233;j&#224; vu will arise during this afternoon&#8217;s debate, as certain themes will come up again and again. Given the level of consensus, it is puzzling why new legislation has taken so long to reach the statute book&#8212;as it will, I hope&#8212;as Patricia Ferguson said in her opening speech.</p><p>I want to use the short time that is available to me to mention a few of the strengths of the bill. The bill will do a number of things. Rogue factors will now have a choice: they will need to shape up or they will have to ship out. I know from my constituency casework that many people who approach me with factoring issues are factored by social landlords, with the Glasgow Housing Association, in particular, featuring among the complaints that I receive. It is vital that social landlords, as factors, are covered by the bill.</p><p>There are drivers to achieve change in the bill. Under section 12, factors that fail to register as such can be fined &#163;5,000. Under section 9, factors that are deregistered or that fail to register will not be able to recover charges and costs that they have levied or incurred from owner-occupiers. I note the partnership working, once more, on amendment 11 earlier this afternoon, which allows for the on-going recovery of costs for actual works that have taken place. That sums up the way in which the bill has progressed through the parliamentary process.</p><p>The powerful sanctions that are contained in the bill should mean that cowboy factors will leave the business and that others will drive up their standards. Driving up standards is indeed an important issue. Most factors are not bad factors. They might be complacent or sloppy, but they are not necessarily bad. We must shine a light on better customer service, which has perhaps been neglected by many a factor in taking their core business for granted. They should not do that.</p><p>I note that deregistration is viewed as a last resort under the bill. That relates to driving up standards, rather than driving people out of the sector. We have now opted for a private rented housing panel and private rented housing committee over the alternatives that were presented. The future will show whether or not that is the right decision, but let us monitor the mechanism and get it right. The principle that underpins it is the idea of mediation and negotiation before escalation and deregistration. It is about factor and consumer working together to reach a positive solution that makes everyone happy.</p><p>There is a responsibility, within that, on home owners. I am able to help out nearly every home owner who comes to me raising issues about factors, but there are always one or two people who are simply unwilling to pay, and who will use any procedure to avoid paying. We have to ensure that a bureaucracy of the non-paying is not created under the bill. I am sure that early monitoring of the bill&#8217;s implementation will be most welcome in that regard.</p><p>I want to finish by talking about one final group, who I mentioned at stage 1: those who get factors&#8217; bills and cannot pay. I seek not to make a party-political point but merely to state on record that there are many people who bought their properties under right-to-buy legislation in the 1980s and who now receive huge factoring bills, but who could never afford to maintain their properties. Those people must be assisted in meeting their responsibilities to make repairs on their properties.</p><p>I commend the bill to the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22645935", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Property Factors (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I did at stage 1, I put on record my thanks to fellow committee members, the clerks and everyone who gave evidence to our committee during the scrutiny process.

Had he died in the waters off the English coast, there would have been a coroner&#8217;s inquiry. If a person normally resident in England had died off the coast of Margarita Island, there would have been a coroner&#8217;s inquiry. The difference in the case of Colin Love&#8217;s tragic death is that, because he was from Scotland, a fatal accident inquiry was not legally allowed. Not only is that crazy; it is wrong.</p><p>Julie Love, co-petitioner Dr Kenneth Faulds and I have all given evidence to the committee on the issue. The committee gave Julie Love the voice and platform that she rightly deserved and provided me as her MSP with a focus for my efforts to push for reform to the law. I thank the committee for that.</p><p>I worked with Julie Love to make a submission to the Cullen inquiry on fatal accident inquiries, calling for the lifting of a legal barrier that prevents FAIs into overseas deaths. Cullen agreed, and a response from the Scottish Government to the report is now pending. The committee has continued Julie Law&#8217;s petition until the Scottish Government responds&#8212;I understand that that happened just yesterday.</p><p>If I am privileged enough to be re-elected in May, I pledge to bring forward a member&#8217;s bill to reform fatal accident inquiries and to lift the restrictions that prevent investigations in Scotland into overseas deaths. I pledge to do that unless whoever forms the Scottish Government in May 2011 acts otherwise and lifts that bar. That is the position that we are in&#8212;, Julie and I, and the workers in my office, who have done much work on the issue.</p><p>Julie Love has a powerful motive for pushing for fatal accident inquiries. FAIs give recommendations, such as that travel companies should not send travellers to an island where people die, that there should be lifeguards or that the British Foreign Office should do things better in handling overseas deaths. They are powerful recommendations and drivers for change. Julie Love is fighting not just for Colin Love but for all the people who are resident in Scotland but who die abroad in future.

Through the four budgets that we have had passed, we will have delivered 76,000 new apprenticeships. I note that that contrasts rather favourably with Labour&#8217;s last four years as the Scottish Executive, during which it delivered 73,000 apprenticeships. We should remember that the Labour Party delivered fewer apprenticeships during a time when the budget was rising significantly, and that we are delivering more apprenticeships during a time when the budget is shrinking drastically.

It is timeous, because it has been a while since I have been to my local science centre, Glasgow Science Centre. I assure the staff and patrons of the science centre who are here today that I will ensure that I visit the centre again in the near future. The debate will reignite my interest in the centre. I apologise to them for not being as active in following their successes as I could have been.</p><p>I want to talk about the role of science in my life. I drifted into teaching modern studies&#8212;social sciences rather than science. However, two of the most exciting lessons that I had as a child were science lessons. In one lesson, I stood in a plastic tray with one hand on the Van de Graaff generator and the other pointed at a Bunsen burner, and lit the Bunsen burner. It was great fun. On another occasion, we were taken down to the local rugby field, where we watched children in the distance banging their cymbals and we had to time how long it took the noise to reach us. It helped us to understand the speed of sound.</p><p>Those are two little examples of curriculum for excellence methods of teaching that have always existed in Scottish schools. It is the kind of good practice that the curriculum for excellence is recognising properly for the first time. Glasgow Science Centre&#8212;and, I am sure, the other science centres&#8212;ignites that kind of excitement and imagination in young people. That is why the centres are so important. We must continue to invest in them because they capture the imagination of people who might otherwise not have been interested in science.</p><p>In preparation for the debate, I looked at some recent data for Glasgow Science Centre. I was hoping that it would be good. It was not good; it was fantastic. Here are some basic figures to begin with: 24 per cent of those who visit Glasgow Science Centre are from Glasgow itself but, as Willie Coffey has rightly pointed out, many, many more come from other parts of the west of Scotland. However, 24 per cent of visitors are from overseas, which shows that, for many people, it is a premier tourist attraction. It is also not the case that the same people in Glasgow and the west of Scotland go time and again, because 59 per cent of those who go to the centre are first-time visitors. Moreover, these are not people who have always been interested in science; the evidence indicates that 37 per cent of those who go through the centre&#8217;s door consider themselves as knowing almost nothing about the subject. They have gone to learn. Finally, in the last year for which figures are available, 104,000 schoolchildren accessed a positive learning outcome via the centre.</p><p>Traditionally, science has been seen as a male-dominated field. That is certainly not the case according to the figures for Glasgow Science Centre, where half the visitors are female. The service that it provides is not gender specific. On every access, delivery and outcome point, the centre is delivering for people.</p><p>I also noted in the recent report on Glasgow Science Centre that it carried out a survey on what it could do better&#8212;Jeez, if we politicians asked what we could do better, the list would be very long. However, half the people who were surveyed could not think of anything that they wanted to be done better; in fact, 67 per cent of people thought that the service that they had received from the science centre was what they had expected or better.

It is vital. Michael McMahon and Patricia Ferguson rightly pointed to the 2007 elections debacle as the reason why action is needed. I do not think that anyone should forget Professor Ron Gould&#8217;s comments that in the whole process the voter was &#8220;an afterthought&#8221;. I will come back to that point.</p><p>We should remind ourselves of the problem areas: combined elections, spoiled papers, electronic vote counting and the single ballot paper design. The problems went on and on, but at their heart was fragmentation&#8212;in the planning, the powers involved, the responsibilities and the accountability. Who was to blame? Where did power lie? Where did the buck stop?</p><p>Since then, action taken by the Scottish Government&#8212;in a consensual way with parties across the Parliament&#8212;has dealt with some of those problems. The Parliament supported the decoupling of Scottish Parliament and local authority elections, which is to be welcomed.</p><p>When we look back on today&#8217;s debate, we will see it as the point at which we started to deal with the fragmentation in the system. Whether or not that is seen as the motivation today, the bill is about dealing with fragmentation. Putting the interim electoral management board on a statutory footing is vital in the process. Also vital is the independence of the board from Government. It will not be accountable to ministers, although its annual reports will be scrutinised. The minister said that the annual report will relate to the board&#8217;s activities and not its competence. I would like more information about that. How will we drill down to scrutinise the effectiveness of the board, and what will the parliamentary procedure for that be?</p><p>Nevertheless, I welcome the bill and think that it brings a coherent structure to the expertise in running Scotland&#8217;s elections that clearly exists throughout the country in the returning officers, the deputy returning officers and the various council officials who have generations of experience of running good elections. None of us should forget about that. The bill will allow information sharing and the sharing of best practice right across our nation and will provide a powerful framework for all elections&#8212;not, I hope, just council elections.</p><p>I will finish on the broad, cross-party consensus that we have achieved today. The Secretary of State for Scotland has intimated that the Government is poised to give the administration of Scottish elections to the Scottish Parliament, and the minister has said that he would speedily change the provisions in the bill to ensure that that was within the competence of the electoral management board. However, I would go further than that. We need full legislative competence over Scottish elections, and administrative competence in relation to UK elections. Of course, I would rather have the great efficiency saving of eradicating UK elections altogether&#8212;of not having any.</p><p>I mentioned the idea of fragmentation because, as far as the bill goes, the buck still does not stop in the one place. We must ensure that we have one Government, one minister and one management board with direct responsibility for all Scotland&#8217;s elections. That is the only way in which we will get direct accountability and drive up standards in the process.</p><p>In terms of a respect agenda, it is an absolute farce that the Scottish Government&#8212;never mind Scottish voters&#8212;was not consulted on whether an AV referendum should be held on the same date as Scotland&#8217;s elections. We should never forget the main reason for the problems with the AV referendum: in UK law, the chief counting officer for the UK determines certain things at 1 pm on the Friday, and certain other things must be done with the AV referendum at 4 pm. That shows complete disrespect to the Scottish Parliament, to Scotland and to democracy.</p><p>However, we cannot deal with the AV referendum just now.

My lasting impression of landlord registration is of how committed and professional the vast majority of landlords in the sector are. The vast majority of landlords&#8212;those who contribute significantly to addressing housing need in our country&#8212;sign up for registration. The landlords&#8217; representative body, the Scottish Association of Landlords, typifies the professional and constructive approach that registered landlords take to meeting housing need.</p><p>However, the registration scheme&#8217;s strength should be its ability to tackle rogue landlords who do not bother to register and who provide accommodation for tenants that we would not consider to be safe or acceptable. I suspect that we all agree that the enforcement power against unregistered rogue landlords is a muscle that has never properly been flexed. I am well aware that barriers exist to potentially successful prosecutions by local authorities and I know that the minister has a working group that is looking at such matters. I would very much appreciate more information about progress on that.</p><p>As we heard earlier, the City of Edinburgh Council put effort, time, finance and commitment into securing the conviction of an unregistered landlord. The court imposed a derisory fine, which must have left the council thinking that there had been little point in pursuing the prosecution in the first place. Ironically, such an example is a real disincentive to local authorities to prosecute unregistered landlords. The bill will increase fines to a maximum of &#163;50,000, which I welcome. There is now a potentially strong, financial incentive for rogue landlords to register. I say &#8220;potentially&#8221; because if convictions are difficult to achieve and rarely occur, and the fines that are imposed are tiny, raising the maximum fine to &#163;50,000 may make little difference.</p><p>However, I take a far more positive view than that. I believe that increasing the maximum fine will send a clear message to courts about how seriously we expect them to treat cases involving rogue landlords. We must ensure that courts perceive landlords who refuse to register as being guilty of serious criminality. After all, councils indulge in prosecutions of unregistered landlords not as a first action but as a last option.</p><p>When councils are aware of a potentially unregistered landlord, they encourage the landlord to apply for registration, to register and to meet the minimum acceptable standards for private rented properties. The question that courts should ask themselves when prosecutions take place is why the landlord did not register in the first place and what a landlord who refuses to register has got to hide. What other forms of criminality might that landlord be involved in? Are some landlords trying to avoid the light that registration would shine on their business? That is why I welcome the bill&#8217;s extension of the fit-and-proper-person test criteria.</p><p>Our courts and our sheriffs need to be aware of such matters. Sheriffs who do not regularly deal with housing-related matters may not be aware of the social context and the damage that is done by rogue landlords&#8212;the misery that they can cause to tenants and the wider community, which we heard about from several members.</p><p>The fine increase should emphasise to sheriffs the importance that Parliament places upon the offence. Reform of the system of prosecution may also help. It has been suggested that we could have special housing courts involving people who are experts in the sector. Such courts could deal more appropriately and swiftly with a range of offences and disputes, including unregistered landlords. Perhaps that could be considered by the Government if it is re-elected. I seek the minister&#8217;s opinion on that.</p><p>We should make it socially unacceptable to use unregistered landlords. I accept that there will always be vulnerable sections of society, such as exploited immigrants or people who, for a variety of reasons, have chaotic lifestyles, that end up renting from unregistered landlords. That is unacceptable, but the rest of us, as consumers, should never knowingly accept accommodation from an unregistered landlord. Consumers would not knowingly buy a dodgy motor or a gas boiler, so why should they rent a dodgy flat? Consumers must exert a degree of responsibility for themselves. Indeed, the example of a dodgy boiler is quite pertinent because there is every chance that that is exactly what someone might end up with if they choose an unregistered landlord. However, we can expect consumers to make an informed choice only if they are given the correct information, which means a public awareness-raising campaign and the possibility of checking whether a landlord is registered. I would appreciate information on that from the minister.</p><p>I would also appreciate the minister&#8217;s views on whether newspapers should be allowed to advertise the properties of rogue landlords. Our newspapers can be great campaigning forces for social good, but they also have a social responsibility, which should extend to not advertising the properties of unregistered landlords. I am not suggesting that we require legislation on that, rather that we have a voluntary code and partnership with the newspaper industry. I have no reason to believe that the press would not sign up to that&#8212;in fact, I am sure that it would welcome such a code.</p><p>There is much more that I wanted to say but, given the limited time available, I will leave it at that.

When we talk about the opportunities in harnessing Scotland's green energy capacity, we tend to think about electricity generation in rural and offshore settings. However, fabrication, supply and maintenance of equipment are also required, and there are a number of spin-off benefits that will establish our urban areas as key players in the Scottish renewables revolution.</p><p>Just before Christmas, I met the chief executive officer of Gaia-Wind Ltd at Port Dundas, in Maryhill, Glasgow, which has just announced an initial investment of &#163;5 million in an assembly plant for small wind turbines, which will create at least 50 high-value jobs. Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government have been praised for their approach in bringing in that investment ahead of other European locations that were going for that business. I also met last week the head of Ofgem in Scotland. Both meetings were incredibly interesting and have given me a real sense of how mistakes in energy policy at this time could have serious consequences for the growth of the sector as well as for the future sustainable growth of the Scottish economy.</p><p>Members will recall that there was a closure announcement not that long ago in Port Dundas, with more than 200 jobs going from Diageo. That gives an idea of why I am keen to get jobs to that part of my constituency. That is my direct constituency interest, and I would like to see Gaia-Wind and others like it investing not just in Glasgow but right across Scotland. I believe that energy policy&#8212;particularly reform of the feed-in tariffs&#8212;may impact on that.</p><p>Gaia-Wind produces small wind turbines that are eligible for the feed-in tariff at the level of 26.7p per kilowatt hour. There was broad political support when that was introduced in April to promote the development of microrenewables, and it has made it more economically viable for small producers, such as farmers and community initiatives, to invest their capital up front in the technology. However, I understand that there are concerns that the scheme is being highly subscribed to by larger commercial interests, particularly in solar panel electricity generation in the south of England. That is not in keeping with the policy intention to boost microrenewables production throughout the UK. David Cameron has also mentioned that in the press recently. With fixed budgets for that FIT scheme being drained, that could have access implications not just for Scotland but for other parts of the UK. I cannot comment on the matter in detail, but I have written to the Department of Energy and Climate Change for more information, saying that I believe that the administration of that scheme is a potential concern and needs to be scrutinised fully by that UK department.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21178165", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will focus on the relationship between electricity market reform and microrenewables and how it may affect funding for Scotland and jobs in my constituency.

I was about to say to the minister that I hope that the Scottish Government will work in partnership with the UK Government to achieve that outcome and to address the possibility of uneven access to the FIT scheme for microrenewables across the UK. Although I am delighted to see renewables investment in all the nations and regions of the UK, as I have just said, I want to ensure that Scottish tax pounds go to foster that market, particularly in Scotland, and that we get our appropriate share. Also, if there is any dubiety about the affordability and long-term management of the FIT scheme because of administration issues or other factors, investor confidence could drain from the scheme, which is not what we want. The sector needs certainty in relation to that.</p><p>FITs for microrenewables are to be reviewed again in 2012, but the current review may impact on that. We have already heard about ROCs and a FIT subsidy for wider, larger-scale electricity investment, and there are direct links there. The FITs must be reviewed, and we hope that that review will move the situation forward. The current level of uncertainty is not helpful, which is why I have written to Chris Huhne on the matter. It seems to be sensible to look at feed-in tariffs across the sector.</p><p>Another aspect of the feed-in tariff subsidy is how European law, as interpreted by the UK Government, affects feed-in tariffs in the nations and regions of the UK. For example, if a farmer or small community-based housing association wanted to build some small wind turbines to lower their carbon footprint and cut electricity bills, they could do that but would perhaps need to find grants for it. Highlands and Islands Enterprise may be in a position to provide a partial grant to help, and the Scottish Government's climate fund could perhaps provide a partial grant.</p><p>Under the UK's application of European law, however, it would not then be possible to apply for a feed-in tariff. Scotland would be using its block grant to lower carbon footprints in communities, but feed-in tariffs would be squeezed out. I am not suggesting that I want individual owners of turbines to get a double subsidy, but I want to consider how feed-in tariffs are accessed across the UK and whether Scottish block grant investment could divert some of the feed-in tariff subsidy from Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"32239\"/></p><p>Those are a couple of issues that are of interest to me&#8212;to be fair, they have only recently become of interest to me because there are 50 new jobs coming to my constituency&#8212;and, as I feel my way ahead in the dark and try to get a grasp of the subject, they are the issues that I would like to be developed and which I believe the minister should consider.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21178165", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome that.

Scotland has been enriched by immigration, just as its people have enriched other countries across the globe. Indeed, homecoming Scotland in 2009 welcomed our Scottish diaspora back to our shores to celebrate that cultural heritage and identity.</p><p>It is only right that Scotland pays tribute to the many races and nationalities from across the world that have made that similar contribution to Scotland. My members' business debate pays tribute to one such group, which is Scotland's Irish community. There is no typical Irish immigrant, but it would be remiss not to mention the mass immigration from Ireland during an gorta m&#243;r or the great hunger, which is better known today as the potato famine. For instance, in just 10 days in August 1847, more than 11,000 new immigrants arrived in Scotland fleeing the great famine. However, the Irish came to Scotland's shores to settle for many years before that and they still do so in modern times for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Irish immigrants often provided blood, sweat and toil to help fuel the industrial revolution here. In Garngad in Glasgow, which has been renamed Royston, the area was transformed by Irish immigration. Whether it was digging the Monkland canal basin at Garngad Hill in 1790 or building the <place-holder colnum=\"32096\"/> St Roch's to Stepps railway in 1831, the impact was massive. Indeed, the area became known as little Ireland.</p><p>Scots know something about culture and identity forged in adversity from our experiences in history. We all know about the thirst that Scots the world over have to preserve our culture and traditions. From Burns nights to St Andrew's days and from highland games to music and dance, there is a strong positive national identity that has been undiluted by passing generations and distance from the homeland. The Irish in Scotland are, rightly, no different.</p><p>As a teenager, I played Gaelic football with a club that was formed by a proud Irish immigrant. I thank all those who were involved with the club, as that experience benefited me as a child. In the city of Glasgow, Tir Conaill Harps provide similar opportunities for youngsters today to play sports such as Gaelic football, hurling and camogie. I pay tribute to the club's work and to the work of others who do good jobs with young people, sometimes in the most deprived parts of my city.</p><p>I often attend Scottish National Party meetings at St Columbkille's church hall in Rutherglen, where at the same time the David Smith School of Irish Dancing is training. I have to say that the Irish dance is often far more enjoyable than the meetings that I attend. The passion, commitment and enthusiasm of the dancers are clear. I congratulate them on their high rankings at the world championships, which were held in Glasgow last year. Such dance classes thrive across Glasgow and beyond.</p><p>The thriving music scene in Scotland is also hugely enriched by our Irish communities. Many of us will enjoy this month's Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow. Irish musicians are well represented at the festival and Glasgow's Irish musicians tell me that they are keen to perform at future Celtic Connections with their distinct flavour of Irish music. I am sure that the festival organisers will want to promote that in future years. Whether it is traditional Irish sports, music, dance or important community work, Glasgow and Scotland are more vibrant, colourful and better places because of our Irish communities.</p><p>We have no idea of just how many Scots of Irish descent there are in Scotland. At the last census, just under 50,000 people living in Scotland were identified as white Irish. However, Scots with an Irish heritage had no way of expressing their ethnic identity. As Scots, we should be proud of and embrace our multiple layers of identity. I am pleased to say that, for this year's census, we will have that option for the first time. For the first time ever, people will be able to express their Scottish and Irish identity in an ethnicity section, which has an Irish category. Irish groups in Scotland will <place-holder colnum=\"32097\"/> rightly campaign to raise awareness of the Irish ethnicity census question. They want to urge people to tick that box. I support that campaign and I encourage all Scots of Irish descent to tick that box with pride.</p><p>I touched earlier on the history of immigrants to Scotland. History is important, but people in Scotland's Irish community are very much looking forward, as active citizens within Scotland, proud of their commitment to our nation of Scotland, but rightly unflinchingly proud of their Irish ethnicity and their roots. They are proud of their multiple layers of identity, which is as it should be.</p><p>The Irish Government, even in the current financially challenging times, continues to invest in and support its diaspora right here in Scotland. It has four development officers who support projects in sport, music and dance. I thank Danny Boyle, Ciaran Kearney, Evin Downey and Patrick Callaghan for their hard work in serving the community. They are all based in Glasgow and paid for by the Irish Government. I pay tribute to the Irish Government for providing that support.</p><p>I support plans by Glasgow's Irish community to establish an Irish centre in the city that would act as a hub not only for the city's Irish communities but for Scotland's Irish communities. Such a hub could have facilities for Irish sports, music, dance and a variety of other cultural activities; serve the wider community; provide real educational benefit to our schoolchildren; and be at the forefront of wider efforts to integrate the various migrant groups that now call Scotland their home. It could also be a force for good in tackling bigotry and sectarianism. Plans are at an early stage but I ask the Scottish Government to provide what support it can. I assure the minister that this is not an early bid for cash in the face of United Kingdom cuts&#8212;at least not at the moment; it might be at some point in future&#8212;but it is a genuine appeal for the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council to meet representatives of the Irish community to find out what support can realistically be provided.</p><p>In welcoming the Scottish Government's plans for a diaspora strategy, I ask that it contact the Irish Government in order to create a distinct strategy for working in partnership to support Scotland's Irish diaspora. The plans for an Irish centre could be core to such a strategy and I would be keen to be involved in that work.</p><p>I could have focused in my speech on specific health needs in the Irish community, given that it has one of the highest levels of certain types of cancer of any minority ethnic group in Britain, or on the poverty that has endured over generations in some Irish communities in Scotland and, indeed, in Britain. However, those are matters for another day. Today is all about welcoming the contributions that Scotland's Irish diaspora has <place-holder colnum=\"32098\"/> made not only to Glasgow, the city that I represent, but right across Scotland, and I am proud to sponsor this evening's debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21176028", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Irish Diaspora"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome to the public gallery my constituents from Glasgow's Irish community, as well as Susan Conlon, head of the Irish consulate in Edinburgh.

As she mentioned, I amended her motion. Peculiarly, I amended it not by deleting a single word but by adding to it. That addition talked about progress since 2007. Whenever I have spoken about such progress, I have said that it has happened because kinship carers lobbied effectively and empowered me and other politicians to promote their message. Therefore, the credit for everything that has been delivered since 2007, whether by the Scottish Government or any other body, goes to the kinship carers who have lobbied relentlessly.</p><p>There is consensus, which I welcome. A year or two ago, we had a kinship care debate that was purely party political. It turned off every kinship carer who watched it, and every party that participated in it shares the blame for its being party political. However, things have moved on. We have had a Scottish National Party Government since 2007. We have a Labour Opposition, and the Conservatives are present. I welcome the fact that Elizabeth Smith mentioned the concordat, as imperfect as it certainly is; I will talk about that. We are united across all parties and, I hope, at all levels of government on getting a better deal for kinship carers.</p><p>I will give one small example of how that can happen. When I talk about what happened in Glasgow, the praise and credit do not go to the Labour Glasgow City Council or to me as an SNP MSP, but to the kinship carers for telling us to get our act together and deliver. I met Mr Purcell when he was Labour group leader. He was, then, unconvinced about kinship care payments, which it is fair to put on the record. Following that meeting and a working group, &#163;40 per week was paid not only to looked-after children but to all kinship-care children&#8212;I say that slightly nervously, because some children have fallen through the cracks; we have to identify them and make sure that they get the money. That was an example of parties working together.</p><p>I recently met David Crawford, the executive director of social care services at Glasgow City Council, and Councillor Matthew Kerr, who has taken over the social care remit from Councillor Archie Graham. We spoke about what will happen to kinship care payments, given the cuts. The first <place-holder colnum=\"31813\"/> thing they said to me was, \"Bob, we know that more than &#163;40 should be paid. We can't reach the target that should be paid, but the least we expect is some form of increase from the &#163;40.\" Even in the face of cutbacks, in Glasgow, Opposition politicians and the Labour Council are working constructively together with me as the local SNP MSP. The issue was not thought of in 2007. We now have a focus of attention because kinship carers have forced all of us to get our act together. I pay tribute to those carers. The issue is not only about money. Of course, the money is important, but we are talking about equality, dignity and tackling poverty, too.</p><p>The issue is also about the wider support mechanisms of local authorities and other agencies. I pay tribute to the Notre Dame Centre in the west end of Glasgow for the fantastic job that it does in taking in the vulnerable children who are looked after by kinship carers. The centre does that at a very reduced rate or no rate at all; it deals with the issues that the children present.</p><p>It seems that foster carers get a first-class service for their children when compared to kinship carers. That is not equality. There is a disparity between those two sets of carers in respite care and additional support. We are all fighting for equality by raising standards.</p><p>I have drawn attention to the money, but the issue goes far wider. In looking to avoid a postcode lottery, of course we have to look at the concordat, which Elizabeth Smith mentioned. The concordat has brought a focus to these issues like never before. There has been progress, but it has not happened quickly enough and it is patchy. That is why we have to come together on a cross-party basis. We need to move forward from May 2011&#8212;no matter which Government is in power. We need to stand united for kinship carers not only before the election but after it, too.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Support for Children (Kinship Care)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the fact that Johann Lamont has secured this members' business debate.

I differ from Robert Brown on the issue&#8212;it is not about a bureaucratic fight between MSPs and the UKBA; it goes far beyond that. We represent those communities and individuals, and to say that it is a bureaucratic stushie misses the core point.</p><p>I will give members one example. A year ago, I held a surgery specifically for the Kurdish community in Glasgow. I had made a few Kurdish friends, and I said to them, \"If you've got friends, family and contacts in the Kurdish community who wouldn't normally see a councillor, an MP or an MSP, bring them along\". About 30 Kurdish individuals went to that event, and we invited police officers, interpreters and people from integration services in the city.</p><p>For about two to three hours after people had given their initial speeches to the asylum seekers&#8212;and to others, because the event was not only for asylum seekers&#8212;I was there writing up case notes on what had to be done in response to people's concerns about schooling, their housing situations or their asylum cases.</p><p>At that point, was I supposed to say to the asylum seeker, \"I'm sorry, but could you just sit at the back of the room&#8212;I'll give you the MP's name later on and they can take up the case for you\"? An asylum seeker might say, \"I'd like to talk to you about my asylum, but I'd also like to talk about the absolute pit that the city council or others have put me in for my accommodation.\" I should say that Glasgow City Council do pretty well on accommodation, but others do not. We cannot pick and choose the cases that come to us, and it is stupid, absurd and ridiculous that the UKBA forces us to do so. It is not good enough.</p><p>I would gently say that some MPs are better than others at dealing with asylum seekers.

I would not say, \"Back off&#8212;that's devolved\"; that is not how it works. It is not good enough for those vulnerable asylum seekers who come to me and tell me stories of torture, rape, exploitation and abuse, and of fearing for their lives. They are often in tears and are reaching and crying out for help, and I have to say to them, \"No. Can you just stop there? That is a reserved matter.\" On humanity, human rights, dignity, social justice and respect&#8212;all the things that make us human, and which are why we get involved in politics in the first place&#8212;we have to say, \"Sorry&#8212;that's reserved to Westminster because of some stushie with the UK Government and the UKBA\".

I thank Patricia Ferguson for introducing the bill, and I thank my fellow committee members, the clerks, and all those who gave evidence to the committee. The bill shows how members of the Scottish Parliament can work in partnership.</p><p>The bill's roots lie with Gordon Jackson in the 2003 to 2007 parliamentary session. It was introduced in the current session by a Labour MSP and it has received strong cross-party support. I and a number of my Scottish National Party colleagues have been strong supporters of the bill and I hope that its general principles will be agreed to at decision time.</p><p>As a fellow Glasgow MSP, I have been keen to support the bill. I and Patricia Ferguson have similar constituency concerns and case loads in relation to property factors, and it is only right that Labour and the SNP MSPs work jointly and constructively to assist their constituents in Glasgow and tackle the problems of poorly performing and, at times, downright cowboy factoring services.</p><p>I commend the <em>Evening Times</em> and <em>The Herald</em> for bringing the issue into sharp focus. Their <place-holder colnum=\"31313\"/> evidence is mentioned in the committee's stage 1 report, as they</p><p class=\"indent\">\"found examples of gross overcharging, allegations of intimidation and threats of bankruptcy for refusal to pay disputed bills\".</p><p>Their service is therefore noted this afternoon.</p><p>Of course, the problem is not just a Glasgow issue. We have heard from MSPs from different parts of the country. The bill sets out to address a Scotland-wide concern.</p><p>I also extend praise to the Scottish Government, which has been working with the property factors stakeholder group to achieve a national voluntary accreditation scheme. I note that work on that has been paused until the outcome of the bill is known. I hope that it will not have to continue at all: I urge the Parliament to support the statutory regulation in the bill. I am sure that the stakeholder group's work will not go to waste and that the knowledge of voluntary accreditation that was gained from the exercise will be used to inform the standards that are expected, including the code of conduct that will be made by regulation. Much of the spadework has been done.</p><p>I favour statutory regulation for a number of reasons. For instance, will rogue factors actually bother to sign up to a voluntary scheme? The committee has already heard of problems in getting property landlords to sign up to a landlord registration scheme. That scheme is compulsory, but because of significant issues in prosecutions only one unregistered landlord has ever been successfully prosecuted.</p><p>If we cannot get cowboy landlords to register for a compulsory registration scheme, what chance would we have of getting rogue factors to join a voluntary accreditation scheme? The case has been made for compulsory accreditation and I believe that it would be beneficial to place registration on a statutory footing.</p><p>There are issues in the bill, and I hope that the committee, including me, as a member, has been constructive in its scrutiny. For example, there are unclear areas around the &#163;5,000 that an unregistered factor would be fined and the enforcement provisions related to that. We comment on that in the committee report. In the financial memorandum, Patricia Ferguson rightly acknowledges that precise costs cannot currently be quantified, as the scheme will be demand led. That is not a problem, but it is one difficulty in assessing accurately the assumptions in the financial memorandum.</p><p>There are three groups of people who use factors. We are here to defend the home owners who have been wronged, given a poor service or exploited by factors. The second group is those who are unable to pay because of financial <place-holder colnum=\"31314\"/> circumstances and the third group, which we must acknowledge, are the unwilling payers who will use any mechanism presented to them to drag out and resist paying because they just do not want to pay. Whether we go for a home owner housing panel or an ombudsman approach, that group will be a difficulty, and the cost assumptions will become difficult for whichever scheme we go for. It is fair to acknowledge that in today's debate.</p><p>The bill is about driving change forward, and the best way to drive change is to make it easier for people to switch their factors. If the industry knows that people have the opportunity to switch, it will up its game. We have acknowledged in the committee report that it is not easy to switch factors. We should not pretend that those who need to switch factors have the capacity to do it: a lot of vulnerable home owners are too busy making ends meet to worry about switching factor. We must make switching easier.</p><p>I will finish by talking about the unintended consequences of deregistration. Paul Martin's point was well made that we plan for deregistration in other fields such as dentistry&#8212;that was the example that was given. The fact that there will be difficulties does not mean that we should not use the power. Indeed, it is essential to have it. However, regardless of how deregistration or other policing mechanisms work, I ask that, if the bill is passed, the next Government conducts an early review to see how it is bedding in. That will be necessary, and amendments may be needed at that stage.</p><p>I will support the bill and I pay tribute to Patricia Ferguson for introducing it.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21129301", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Property Factors (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Property Factors (Scotland) Bill at stage 1.

That sector receives most of its work via local authorities. It wants indicative figures for three years because it hopes that councils will give it more security of funding, and I understand that.

They wanted to know whether a &#163;7.15 living wage in the public sector would have an impact on the voluntary sector. They wanted to understand better whether if councils had no compulsory redundancies, that would keep more work in-house in local authorities and whether, as budgets were squeezed, work would be brought back in-house to avoid compulsory redundancies. They wanted to know how they might benefit from further challenge funding that was similar to the &#163;70 million that the NHS will deploy in social care, to promote preventative spend.</p><p>A dynamic landscape is at play in challenging times.

I might come back to it later.</p><p>This Parliament has taken steps to ensure that lessons were learned from the organisation of the May 2007 Scottish Parliament elections. As we have heard, the Local Government and Communities Committee, on which I sit, conducted an inquiry into those elections and took extensive evidence on the matter, including from Professor Ron Gould, who undertook the Electoral Commission's inquiry into the elections. The Local Government and Communities Committee and Ron Gould recommended that there be a decoupling of the Scottish Parliament and local government elections. That recommendation was made for a number of reasons, not least of which was the need to ensure that the count would run as smoothly as possible and that there would be less confusion for voters when casting their votes.</p><p>There were other reasons, of course. We must ensure that there is parity of esteem with regard to the various sets of elections that we have in Scotland. There was a feeling that the council elections were overshadowed by the fact that the Scottish Parliament elections were held on the same day. It is probable that a significant section of the electorate voted for a party based on who they wanted to form the next Scottish Government and that they did so not only when they voted in the Scottish Parliament elections, but when they voted in the council elections. In other words, for some, there might have been little consideration of the issues in the council elections because the understandably intense media focus on the Scottish Parliament elections squeezed out any meaningful debate on the various merits of individual council candidates or the track record of council administrations across the country.</p><p>That is why the Scottish Government, supported by the Parliament, decoupled those elections. The Parliament and its committees united to act in the best interests of running our democratic process as effectively as possible. I emphasise that unity because, although members of the Parliament have very different visions of how to take forward democracy in Scotland, following the 2007 elections we managed to work together, consider the evidence base and act to find a Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"30673\"/> solution to the problems that existed at that point. Decoupling was an essential part of that approach. However, at a stroke, the UK Con-Dem Government has ridden roughshod over that Scottish democracy. To have a UK referendum on electoral reform on the same day as Scotland's elections to its national Parliament is a gross insult to Scotland's re-emerging democracy and is, in effect, an attempt to marginalise not only the democratically elected Parliament of Scotland, but the Assemblies of Wales and Northern Ireland, which will also hold their elections on that day.</p><p>It is clear that the UK media will hook on to and provide wall-to-wall coverage of the UK AV referendum. Indeed, we have only to look at the leaders' debates during the recent UK election, in which questions and answers routinely focused on day-to-day devolved issues that related only to England.</p><p>Another example is the recent edition of \"Question Time\" to which Anne McLaughlin referred. The chair, David Dimbleby, ruled out of order a discussion on the construction sector in Scotland because that area is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. However, the following week the same Mr Dimbleby allowed an extensive discussion on tuition fees in England, despite the programme being broadcast throughout the UK. We cannot have confidence that our UK broadcast media will give due respect to the Scottish elections, and the Conservatives and Lib Dems cannot escape from that issue, much as they try.</p><p>Now we are to hold an AV referendum that applies across the UK on the same day as Scotland's national elections. I do not think that any Conservative or Lib Dem member really believes that the electorate will be fully informed as a result of the clash; I just do not buy the argument.</p><p>I suspect that the Lib Dems and the Conservatives very much hope that the AV elections will overshadow the Scottish elections, as they know that they cannot put up with the scrutiny that they will face in the latter.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21091954", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alternative Vote Referendum Date"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I normally enjoy listening to Mr Brown, whether or not I agree with him, but I thought that his speech was, by his standards, quite poor.

Both groups have done a fantastic job.</p><p>In the small amount of time that I have, I will quickly set the scene on affordable housing in Scotland. I remind the chamber that 2,609 more affordable houses were built in Scotland in 2009-10 than in 2006-07. That was the result not of a magic wand approach by the Scottish Government, but of sheer investment&#8212;&#163;1.7 billion was provided, which represented a 19 per cent increase. To that can be added the capital acceleration from 2010-11.</p><p>I mention that because we know that capital investment is starting to dry up because of cuts by the UK Government in the amount of spending for Scotland. That is why reform of the right to buy is important. The Scottish Government is to invest &#163;80 million in council housing. Up to 3,500 new council houses will be commenced in this session, not just because of Scottish Government investment, but because of reform of the right to buy.</p><p>Only six new council houses were built under the previous Labour-Lib Dim&#8212;sorry, Lib Dem; although perhaps I was right the first time&#8212;Executive. The springboard for the upsurge in that number was not just the Scottish Government's financial commitment; it was the clear signposting in the SNP manifesto of the ending of the right to buy for new-build houses, which I believe will become increasingly important as we navigate our way through UK Tory spending cuts.<place-holder colnum=\"29935\"/></p><p>That is important because local authorities can deal with a subsidy of around &#163;20,000 to &#163;25,000 in terms of a housing association grant subsidy. The reason for that is that they bring additional things to the table such as land and other assets that housing associations sometimes do not have. They would not be willing to use those assets were it not for the reform of the right to buy. I think that that is a core element of what we have in front of us, and I am proud to say that we are part of that. I, too, reject the negative, dogmatic ideology of the Conservatives on the right to buy.</p><p>The social housing charter is quite a serious issue&#8212;perhaps Mr Tolson should stop laughing&#8212;as it looks at the wider role and activities of the housing associations, local authorities and landlords and praises them for how they benefit the amenity and environmental wellbeing of local areas and for how they participate in their regeneration. Many a housing association has done that in the past, but has not always received the credit for it.</p><p>I will mention one local housing association, with which I know that Patricia Ferguson also has a relationship. Cadder Housing Association has intervened to help a local community to keep its community centre, which was threatened with closure. One of the issues that Cadder raised with me was that it has to make sure that it concentrates on its core business of providing affordable housing. Under the social housing charter and the wider role, the housing association will be able to be assessed and given credit for its positive community activity.</p><p>It is important to mention the benefit cuts. This morning, the Local Government and Communities Committee heard that some local authorities could be down by 25 per cent in housing benefit revenue and 10 per cent in council tax benefit revenue because of the Tory cuts over the next three or four years. That is a heavy impact indeed, and I am delighted that this Government and most parties in the chamber are rallying to protect social housing.

We need a long-term strategy that will support those remarkable people now and in the future. Estimates suggest that as many as one in eight of the population care for someone on a voluntary basis and that there are more than 66,000 unpaid carers in Glasgow, the area that I represent. Those figures are likely to rocket in the years ahead, and it is predicted that as many as 1 million people in Scotland will be performing a <place-holder colnum=\"29794\"/> caring role by 2037. Such statistics show why it is important that we get this right for the long term.</p><p>There is little dispute that we have an aging population, and I have already given an idea of the projections associated with that. A further projection is that there will be a 144 per cent increase by 2031 in the number of people who are aged 85 or over. Where possible, we want to keep people at home and in the community, and we will need unpaid carers to help in that regard. That means that we have to take action now, and the strategy that is set out in the \"Caring Together\" document outlines the thinking and plans in that regard of the Scottish Government and COSLA up to 2015. I think that we are on the right track and are moving forward in relation to that.</p><p>I also hope that we will gain cross-party support in opposing some of the more harmful aspects of the UK Government's cuts, which could jeopardise carers. I say that not to make a party-political point. If we are to support carers, we have to consider all the aspects that affect them. Earlier this month, even before the spending review was announced, the think tank, Demos, claimed that disabled people and carers could lose up to &#163;9.2 billion by 2015 due to the Conservative and Liberal Democrat UK Government linking benefits to the consumer prices index rather than the retail prices index. It also said that families with disabled children in which one of the adults is also disabled and is cared for by their partner could lose up to &#163;3,000. There are hidden dangers in such proposals, and the Scottish Parliament does not necessarily have the power to protect carers in that regard.</p><p>I will not say more about the UK situation, as I want to forge cross-party support, but we have to be aware of where all of the balls are on the pool table when we take a shot to help carers. We cannot miss that out.</p><p>I want to spend the rest of my speech talking about kinship carers, which is a subject that is close to my heart. I am sure that Mary Scanlon will gladly recognise that kinship carers got no structured formal payments before May 2007 and will come on board with the structure that is now in place. That structure has to be improved and made more sophisticated. I am delighted to say to Ms Scanlon that the Labour Party is moving forward in a spirit of consensus in relation to kinship care. At lunch time, I was at an event with Johann Lamont and neither of us was trying to blame the other for having a worse record in relation to kinship care. Instead, we were trying to find solutions that can be used to take forward the situation.

The Maryhill area in which I live has long been associated with some of the worst heroin addiction rates in the country.</p><p>If there was an easy way to solve the drugs problem, we have certainly had enough time to find it. There is no easy solution. There have been many initiatives in the past, but assessing whether they have had any impact is not always straightforward given that we will never know just how much better or worse the national drug problem would have been if those initiatives had not taken place. It is notoriously difficult to quantify the benefit of any individual initiative.</p><p>I accept with a heavy dose of realism that many countries have similar issues with addiction. However, our problem in Scotland is unacceptable to us and we must persist with action to tackle the blight of drugs. Our collective desire should be to reduce the blight of drugs on our communities to a <place-holder colnum=\"28541\"/> significantly lower level than we have at present and to do so at a rate that has never previously been achieved. We cannot sit and watch as the volume of drug-related crime and mortality and the range of social ills that derive from problem drug use continue to increase in the long term at enormous social and economic cost to us all.</p><p>That the problem affects everyone in Scotland at some level is in no doubt. Our hearts go out to the many families who have been directly affected by drug use&#8212;I have worked with many of them in the constituency and the communities that I serve&#8212;but let us also remember that the financial burden to Scottish society is estimated at an overwhelming &#163;3.5 billion per annum. That is the cost of dealing with drug addiction. Any strategy to attack the drugs issue must also have at its heart the financial implications for citizens, and that requires a long-term financial commitment from the Government to reduce the ludicrous cost to our nation. We need to think of spending on addiction services as a financial investment as well as a social and moral duty.</p><p>On that basis, I ask that, in the national interest, policy makers from all our parties consider the financial implications of our nation's drug problem. I contend that, even as we face unprecedented cuts in public spending, we must do all that we can to ensure that, where possible, long-term investment in addiction services is increased in line with need. That is a difficult challenge but one that we must strive to meet where possible.</p><p>We also need to consider how the money is spent and how we can provide services as efficiently as possible. Many people believe that the pursuit solely of a harm reduction approach merely fosters a drug dependency culture and that the road to recovery model is long overdue. I agree. The Government has taken a bold lead in moving to recovery-based interventions. We have set the tone on a policy level, but far more remains to be done. In financial terms, there has been a 20 per cent increase over three years in the allocation to health boards for front-line drugs services but, more important, the Government has initiated the structures that we hope will deliver more effective treatment based on the underlying philosophy that drug addicts can completely recover from addiction and live rewarding lives without drugs.</p><p>We must ensure that there is clinician and local provider buy-in to the road to recovery model&#8212;that is essential&#8212;and that no part of the country persists with a one-club strategy of harm reduction only. Addicts can get clean and addicts do stay clean.</p><p>The Government is well on the way to achieving the self-imposed target of 90 per cent of addicts who require treatment being referred to an appropriate service within three weeks. Waiting <place-holder colnum=\"28542\"/> times are down, but I accept that there is a need to look beyond the statistics and examine the quality of the treatment that addicts receive.</p><p>I would like us to develop further the process of drug recovery treatment in our prisons. I know that some of the amendments cover that. The scale of the problem in prisons is clear. I have spoken to experts in the addiction field who are keen to look at the procedures for onward referral outwith the prison service, on release, and throughcare and continued support. We must strive to do better in that area. I am sure that the Government will take that on board and look for more progressive models to enable us to do that.</p><p>I have spoken to residential rehabilitation providers who have often, because of a lack of beds, had to turn away addicts whom their services would have suited. Turning away a cry for help can mean the difference, literally, between life and death. We must monitor how we use our resources to achieve positive outcomes for individuals and rebuild their lives. I want there to be adequate provision for anyone who takes the bold move to come off drugs. We need to think of the cost of treating the addict versus the cost to society of not doing so.</p><p>Specific treatments for addictions remain controversial and subject to a never-ending debate, but members should unite and send our best wishes to those who seek answers on our behalf. I am sure that we will follow with interest the outcome of the discussions involving the Scottish Drugs Recovery Consortium and its contribution to a recovery-based strategy, which we all support.</p><p>I want to use my final moments to talk about the realise community project, which was a local drugs project in the Maryhill area of Glasgow. It was close to me and my heart, but it folded recently. It put at its centre employability, pre-employability and productive things for recovering addicts to do in their lives, and gave a huge amount of added value at very limited cost to the taxpayer. It got adult learners to go to community-based education and helped to get them clean and to sustain them in being clean. There were positive throughputs to further and higher education destinations. People rebuilt their lives. I am talking about the voluntary sector making achievements at low cost. Unfortunately, the organisation is no longer with us. I ask all local authorities and public providers to think about using the voluntary sector more appropriately so that high outcomes are achieved for small costs.</p><p>I will support the amendments this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20995658", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As an MSP for the Glasgow region, I have a long-standing interest in the treatment of drug addiction.

I pay tribute to local authorities and housing associations, which are often the main target of frustrated tenants who have struggled to get suitable accommodation, often because of the right to buy. Councils and housing associations have continued to do all that they can to support social housing in our communities. There is no better example of that than the new generation of council houses in Scotland. There will be about 3,000 new council houses in Scotland under the Scottish Government. Under the previous Scottish Executive, I believe that there were about six. The rebirth of council houses in Scotland is clearly something for which the Scottish Government should be thanked. The proposed reform of the right to buy has clearly been a major incentive in achieving that goal.</p><p>In the 1980s, the right to buy changed social housing from being a housing option of first choice for many people to being a housing option of last resort.

It is a denial of choice for them.</p><p>I turn to another aspect of the right to buy. Understandably, the Housing (Scotland) Bill takes into consideration those who have been forced to leave their homes due to demolition works. In Glasgow, there are significant numbers of them. Many of those tenants will move to new-build houses, and in those circumstances they will retain the right to buy. I ask the minister to review that, because it is possible that the record levels of investment that the Scottish Government is giving Glasgow for new-build social housing might not sustain the social housing legacy that they should provide. Ultimately, the money could subsidise a new generation of high-quality social rented houses that would be lost under the right to buy. I ask the minister to reflect on the matter and consider it further.</p><p>The provisions on tackling rogue landlords have also received much attention. More powers are needed to tackle such landlords effectively. The private sector housing bill that will be introduced in the autumn will no doubt make a significant contribution in that respect, but existing powers are not being exercised. It is important to ask why that is the case. For instance, to date there has been no criminal conviction of a rogue landlord who has failed to register and meet the standards that are required in the landlord registration schemes that councils currently operate. The fine at the court's disposal is &#163;5,000. Under the bill, fines will increase to &#163;20,000, but the size of the fine is irrelevant if there are never any prosecutions. Would a &#163;100,000 fine make any difference if there is no enforcement? It is clear that we need to tackle that issue.</p><p>I suspect that a local authority would have to spend considerable time and effort and make a considerable financial commitment to pursue and achieve a conviction, and a conviction in any criminal matter is not a foregone conclusion. However, any fine that a court imposed would not be passed to the local authority; rather, it would go to the UK Exchequer. The system should be reformed. Money that is raised through criminal fines that courts have imposed on rogue landlords should be used to support local authorities to monitor and regulate the private housing sector. In increasingly challenging financial times, we must find ways of supporting councils to meet their responsibilities. Allowing them to retain court fines would be a strong incentive and would provide such support. There would be zero cost to the UK Exchequer. I have written to our new Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, to ask him to back my calls for that money to be retained by Scottish local authorities for enforcement in private <place-holder colnum=\"27595\"/> housing.

The subway is an asset not just to our city's citizens, but to the many visitors who come to Glasgow from other Scottish local authorities for shopping or socialising, for our museums and parks, for architecture or for our range of festivals. The subway is a vital resource in ferrying not just Glaswegians, but fellow Scots across our city. Without it, both Glasgow and Scotland would be worse off, not just because of traffic and transport problems, but from an environmental perspective. There would be a significant impact on the quality of life for many people. There is also a thriving and growing tourism and conference market in Glasgow, which benefits the whole of Scotland and relies on Glasgow's subway.</p><p>The subway's importance is clear. However, more than 100 years on from its birth and around 30 years on from its previous modernisation, it is in need of some care and attention, and of some significant investment.<place-holder colnum=\"27542\"/></p><p>I was recently fortunate enough to take a tour of the subway tunnels from SPT, so at around midnight I was walking underneath the city, from Cowcaddens through to Buchanan Street and on towards St Enoch's. I was shown the challenges that the stresses and strains of near constant usage and old age present to Glasgow's subway.</p><p>Along with my colleague Anne McLaughlin, I met one of the nightshift teams that work unseen under the city's streets to ensure that the subway can operate the next day. They do a fantastic job as they attempt to battle constantly against corrosion, to replace existing parts and to battle the effects of severe water penetration in certain parts of the tunnels.</p><p>Looking at the challenges that face Glasgow's subway in the years ahead, I have to say that the situation provides a wake-up call for those who have so forcefully called for the Glasgow airport rail link to be reinstated. GARL was desirable&#8212;I said that it was a desirable project&#8212;but it was a non-essential addition to the west of Scotland's infrastructure. Let me be clear that the difference between the two is that Glasgow's subway is a vital and essential part of existing infrastructure. With GARL we cannot miss what we never had, but in the case of the subway we must value and invest in what we already have in order to secure it for future generations. That is the core of the Glasgow subway issue.</p><p>When I met senior officials to discuss the challenges and opportunities of subway modernisation, I met committed and passionate people. I have no reason to doubt their ability or their competence but, as it is part of the SPT family, I would not want the subway modernisation project to be tarnished with the persistent and serious concerns that exist over the culture and governance at the very top of SPT. I would clearly need significant reassurances that any public money that is spent during a period of public spending cuts that are unprecedented in modern times was being well used.</p><p>As a Glasgow MSP I must say that there is a lingering uncertainty and doubt over the culture that existed, and may still exist, within SPT. Let me say, however, that I pledge to work in partnership, across party affiliation and with SPT, to deliver a subway system that is well placed for the 21st century. Perhaps, rather than looking to SPT to leverage in cash, we need to consider alternative ownership options for the Glasgow subway system and thereby to free our subway system from the unwelcome shadow of the old SPT culture. Perhaps we have to think out of the box. Opposition parties sometimes demand cash that may not be there, but we must work together on this project across party political lines and attempt to identify cash, which will&#8212;let us not kid <place-holder colnum=\"27543\"/> ourselves&#8212;be difficult, and leverage it in to safeguard Glasgow's subway for the future.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20853302", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow's Subway"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a resident of and frequent commuter in Glasgow, I begin by saying how much I value the Glasgow subway.

That is the case, no matter how much one party might wish to rewrite history. That said, every party&#8212;including the party of Scottish independence, the SNP&#8212;believes in greater fiscal powers for the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>I turn to mutual respect. Every party must be able to express their views on further fiscal powers in an open, considered and respectful manner. There is a responsibility on all parties to do so. Scotland is moving beyond Calman and it is important that we do that in an inclusive way. Calman's fiscal proposals revolve around personal income tax rates. As the proposals currently stand, the UK Government would reduce income tax rates at every level by 10 per cent and decrease the Scottish block grant by a corresponding level. If Scotland wanted to reverse the cuts to our block grant, the Scottish Government would have to disapply the 10 per cent UK cut in order to maintain current income levels.</p><p>I have serious issues in relation to those proposals. For instance, how would the UK Exchequer estimate the amount of money that would be raised in Scotland in the coming financial year through income tax? Of course, in order to calculate Scotland's block grant for any financial year, any cash reduction would need to be estimated in advance. What procedures would be put in place to adjust the cash that is given to the Scottish Government in subsequent financial years should the UK Government underestimate the tax that it would collect in Scotland? Would we see a corresponding cut in income to Scotland from London in the following financial year? If so, would that be fair to Scotland, given that the lower tax take may be due to a UK Government mishandling of the economy? That is a very real concern, given the current state of the UK economy and the UK's financial predicament.</p><p>Furthermore, given the expenditure limits that the UK Government places on the Scottish Parliament, which were exposed most infamously in the discovery of the &#163;180 million fossil fuel levy that Scotland has had denied to it thus far, would any additional tax take through growth from UK Treasury forecasts actually be forthcoming to the Scottish Parliament and a Scottish Treasury? Would any increased national insurance contributions that result from growth in the economy be forthcoming to the Scottish Parliament? The great fear is that tinkering with fiscal powers, as Calman proposes, may be used <place-holder colnum=\"26665\"/> by English MPs as a Trojan horse to reduce funding to Scotland in forthcoming years, year after year. I am not saying that that will happen, but it is a very real fear.</p><p>Despite all those issues, Calman's fiscal powers are important in one vital aspect: they have created consensus between the UK parties and the SNP. The consensus is not the Calman report itself&#8212;after all, the proposals are not set in stone&#8212;but that we all want further empowerment in terms of fiscal powers for the Scottish Parliament. That is the consensus that we have in the chamber today. I want full fiscal powers within an independent Scotland. I passionately believe that that is best for us all. I want the Scottish people to vote on the proposal in an independence referendum. I also believe that it is for the Scottish Parliament to decide whether the Scottish people get a vote on the matter. That said, if the next step in Scotland's financial relationship with the UK falls short of independence but delivers further fiscal powers, let us ensure that those powers are as empowering as possible for this place and for Scotland.</p><p>Other members have referenced the Steel commission, about which many of my Liberal Democrat colleagues are supportive. The commission said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Parliament should be given responsibility for all taxes except those reserved to the UK\"</p><p>and that it</p><p class=\"indent\">\"should have the ability to vary the tax rate for each of the 'devolved' taxes.\"</p><p>In other words: purely devolved taxes for devolved services and purely reserved taxes for reserved services. The commission also suggested that devolved taxes could include income and corporation tax. The Steel commission envisaged that taxes for devolved services should be entirely designed and set by the Scottish Parliament&#8212;which is in direct contrast with Calman. The Steel commission allows for a progressive devolved taxation, with the ability to choose personal allowance levels for that system. The commission also believed that the Scottish Government should be given borrowing powers.</p><p>The Steel commission does not provide the solution that I advocate, and I will continue to push for independence, but its findings demonstrate that the fiscal elements of Calman have substantial inadequacies, not just as far as the party of independence is concerned, but for the other parties, which believe in the United Kingdom. We have all exposed those inadequacies&#8212;that has been done here this morning.</p><p>I want a financial framework that has been designed in Scotland and which allows all cash that has been raised in Scotland to go directly to <place-holder colnum=\"26666\"/> the Scottish Parliament. That means income tax, national insurance, corporation tax and criminal fines imposed in Scottish courts going not to the UK Exchequer, but to a Scottish Exchequer&#8212;and, of course, oil revenues. All those powers and more remain missing&#8212;and let us not forget that this Parliament cannot borrow one single penny.</p><p>Short of independence, the relationship that we should have is one where we sign a cheque to the UK Exchequer for reserved areas&#8212;a block grant to Westminster. Let the British parties decide whether they wish to sign a cheque for nuclear weapons, illegal wars or subsidising the London Olympic games. Short of independence, that would be a move in the correct direction, although that is merely my opinion. I prefer independence.

It predicts that Scottish Government departmental expenditure limit expenditure may not recover to last year's levels until 2022. We know that the task that we face is enormous, and Scotland's councils have as large a task as any other public body has in dealing with the cuts.

A key issue that we considered and a key aspect of the report was shared services. Michael Cook from COSLA admitted in giving evidence that local authorities could have done more in the past with respect to shared services. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we may not have waved the flag strongly enough to signal our success in driving forward efficiencies\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 23 September 2009; c 2355.]</p><p>The committee's convener alluded to that. The committee shared the feeling that the financial crisis may have forced the hand of local authorities, but they should have done much of the work on shared services before they got into the predicament in which they now find themselves.</p><p>Sharing services provides many opportunities, but it has pitfalls. On the opportunities that it provides, people in Glasgow will not be aware that, if they phone the Glasgow trading standards department, they will reach a call centre in the Western Isles. Services are being shared at the moment, and they could be shared in a range of areas, such as in council tax collection, bin collection and parking enforcement. Such things should have been considered before, but we must focus on them now.</p><p>On the pitfalls of sharing services, we have already heard that explaining things to constituents in different local authority areas will be quite difficult. For example, the same officers may levy different parking fines in different areas, or people in one local authority area may have to pay for domestic refuse uplifts, whereas people in another local authority area may not have to pay for them, although the same lorry may collect the refuse. Messages must be communicated to constituents if services are going to be shared.</p><p>The one thing that we should focus on is that any efficiency savings will eventually lead to redundancies, which could be significant. It is the rightful place of trade unions and employers to manage how those redundancies take place but, when they do, we in Parliament must be mature and must achieve consensus. We should avoid party politics. When our local authorities and trade unions try to do the best for their workers, services <place-holder colnum=\"26333\"/> and constituents, the people will not accept members playing party politics.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20808658", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police Numbers: \"Report on Local Government Finance Inquiry\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is a very good question.

Perhaps that was a vain aspiration, given that a UK general election is looming, and given some of the speeches that we have heard&#8212;I exempt Ross Finnie from that observation.</p><p>I want to consider two key aspects of economic recovery under the Scottish Government. First, I welcome the record level of social rented housing that the Government has delivered, which is an example of how the provision of essential economic stimulus and the securing of important social benefit can be combined in difficult times. In Glasgow, for example, which I represent, there has been a massive 80 per cent increase in new-build social rented housing under the Government, compared with a similar period under the previous Scottish Executive. In terms of bricks and mortar, that represents an additional 1,500 houses for social rent in my city. The approach has helped Glasgow's economy, because more brickies, plumbers, joiners, sparkies and so on have retained their jobs or had jobs created for them. More small businesses in Glasgow and beyond are being supported by the Scottish Government.</p><p>I am proud of that achievement, which is a success for the Parliament as a whole. There was no great mystery or secret to the achievement of the figures. The Scottish Government took a policy decision to increase the Scottish affordable housing investment programme by 19 per cent <place-holder colnum=\"25244\"/> over three years and to spend around &#163;1.7 billion in total. As we heard, a further &#163;31 million will be added to that, which I welcome.</p><p>As a minority Government, we sought consensus to pass our budget in order to make that investment. Although the Parliament has not spoken with one voice in many recent budgets, as a minority Government the Scottish National Party managed to gain a majority to lever in that &#163;1.7 billion record investment. We can have consensus in trying to tackle the serious economic problems that we face.</p><p>Another reason for such welcome figures on social rented housing in Glasgow, and indeed figures on affordable housing across Scotland, is that we sought to accelerate much of the capital investment from 2010-11 into earlier years. The Parliament achieved consensus on that, too, and there was general agreement that that would allow the affordable housing sector to support private companies during the recession. The sector was seeing a huge drop in available finance to build private properties and, indeed, a significant drop in demand for such housing due to the income shock that many were suffering.</p><p>The Parliament also agreed that, having accelerated capital expenditure from 2010-11 into earlier years, it would be dangerous and wrong to slam the brakes on such capital acceleration. All parties called for a further acceleration from the 2011-12 UK budget&#8212;we agreed that capital acceleration should happen for just one more year, until our construction sector became stronger&#8212;but when the UK Government's budget was presented, there was no provision for such capital acceleration. Scotland's housing sector felt badly let down by both Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, and it is private businesses, particularly in the construction sector, that will bear the brunt.</p><p>I genuinely urge Labour MSPs to approach their UK colleagues, should they be in a position to influence policy after the forthcoming general election, and to stand up once more for capital acceleration; it is important. I urge my Conservative and Liberal Democrat colleagues to do likewise and to build a consensus from within the Parliament. I certainly know that my SNP colleagues in this Parliament and the House of Commons will be carrying that message, but I hope that from within this Parliament we can start to rebuild the consensus.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20756496", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economic Recovery Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I hoped to strike a note of consensus in my speech, at least initially.

Although it was not initially intended as part of the economic recovery strategy&#8212;it was designed to help small businesses to develop and flourish&#8212;in the current difficult economic times it has become by default a key section of our economic recovery platform.

Given that <place-holder colnum=\"24559\"/> the situation is on-going, it would be inappropriate to talk in any more detail about that case.</p><p>Community activists have campaigned vocally on the ground for many years for the good of their local areas. That is quite different from people just doing their jobs. Those activists are invaluable to their communities and deserve our gratitude. So, too, do our police officers, who are the front line and who have to face up to serious and organised criminals daily. Much of their work goes unseen and unrecognised. Often, they are criticised when matters in relation to serious and organised crime are not progressed as quickly as communities understandably demand, or when people feel that individual officers make poor judgment calls on specific matters. However, by and large, our police officers do a fantastic job day in, day out and often tackle serious and organised crime head on. I record my thanks to them.</p><p>In the context of communities fighting back against criminals, and of police officers taking the fight directly to them, the Parliament has an overarching duty and obligation to work together constructively and positively. We are getting far better in our fight against serious and organised crime and progress is being made, but there is no room for complacency. Along with other members, I attended the Glasgow crime summit on Monday. I thank the deputy leader of the SNP opposition group in Glasgow City Council, Billy McAllister, for pulling that event together. I also thank Kenny MacAskill, representatives of the SCDEA and the gangs task force, Professor Graeme Pearson and many MSPs and councillors for attending the event.</p><p>As a result of attending the summit, I can assure members that our professional crime fighters are focused and proactive and are becoming increasingly intelligent about how to take on the criminals. There is no complacency. There was also no defensiveness about evaluating current performance. Continued self-analysis and best-practice improvement is vital to continued and increased success. I hope that that will be the tone in the Parliament too, so that when there are challenges to improving the performance of our police force, we join together constructively to deal with those challenges. That is what our communities expect from us.</p><p>It is important that we do not normalise the activities of organised criminals. That is one reason why it is important that we do everything in our power to prevent them or their associates from winning contracts from the public sector. Such contracts not only normalise criminals' activities, but allow them to cash in at taxpayers' expense and create opportunities for money laundering through their ill-gotten gains. I therefore welcome the Scottish Government directive to ensure that <place-holder colnum=\"24560\"/> private security operatives must be registered with the Security Industry Authority before they can bid for public contracts. That requirement for registration will ensure that the regulations on the sector squeeze out many of the criminal elements. The measure has led to security contracts for the Commonwealth games being refused. However, a number of my constituents are unhappy that some contracts were awarded before the measure came into force in December 2009.</p><p>I have had similar complaints from constituents about the signing of a contract between Network Cars and Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board, after police expressed significant concerns and said that the contract should not be awarded. The board has said that, under European Union law, it had no power to refuse to award the contract. However, I understand that the flexibility of public bodies to refuse procurement contracts can be determined by the way in which the initial tender document is drafted. Get the tender document wrong, and the ability to rule out organised criminals from juicy public contracts can be drastically reduced. Therefore, I ask the cabinet secretary to consider exploring ways of extending best practice and advice on the drawing up of tender documents to ensure that maximum flexibility is given to refuse contracts when there are concerns in relation to organised crime.</p><p>Another serious aspect of tackling organised crime is getting more bobbies on the beat. That has been vital, because for so long organised criminals have been challenged by covert surveillance organisations and local community bobbies have backed off. That does not happen any more&#8212;local community bobbies are tackling organised criminals head on in every facet of their empire. I am proud of the job that those officers do.

As someone who has signed up to Patricia Ferguson's proposal to require property factors to register with an appropriate body and to develop an effective dispute resolution scheme for home owners and property factors, I believe that it is important to debate and consider these matters. I am sure that Patricia Ferguson will agree, <place-holder colnum=\"24237\"/> however, that it is impossible for members to give a blank cheque to any future factoring bill, in particular because the precise details of the bill remain to be published and robust parliamentary scrutiny must be undertaken before the Parliament makes any final decisions. I have spoken to Patricia Ferguson about the matter and, on a one-to-one basis, I have given my support for the bill proposal.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson and I have heard similar complaints from constituents in north Glasgow about factoring services. We perhaps even share some of those constituents. Many constituents seek the maximum representation when dealing with their factors and the problems that arise; in itself, that provides a significant indication that there is a problem with poor-quality factoring. Constituents often feel helpless in their dealings with factors.</p><p>I have direct experience of just how unclear the factoring system can be. I stay in a tenement property in Maryhill. If one of my neighbours highlights to the factor that there is an issue with the lock on the secure entry door at the front of the close, I will find out about it during the following billing period, when I will have the privilege of receiving a bill for it. However, I am likely to be unaware of whether the door was given a cursory glance by a handyman or whether a specialist attended to the fixing of said front door. I will be well aware of the bill for the pleasure of having someone come out to have a look at it, although I will not know any details of what has been done. Similar situations often arise when light bulbs need to be replaced in the common close, or when something in the back court needs to be attended to&#8212;or when a number of other apparently minor matters arise in or around properties.</p><p>There is a feeling that best value is not always a consideration for factors. The more a customer is billed, the greater the management fee that is applied, so many people feel that there might be a disincentive to seek best value.</p><p>I should be clear that most factors seek best value for customers, are not cowboys and do not exploit. However, perception can be everything, and a move towards regulation could provide reassurance for householders and defend the reputation of good, decent factors. Good factors have nothing to fear from statutory regulation, and everything to gain. Their reputations will be enhanced. Regulation will be an incentive to factors to make their billing systems as transparent as possible and to achieve best value for the customer. Regulation could chase the cowboy factors out of town.</p><p>Much of my constituency casework involves disputes between owner-occupiers and factors, many of whom are social landlords. In many <place-holder colnum=\"24238\"/> cases, that means the Glasgow Housing Association. I do not intend to use my speech just to hammer the Glasgow Housing Association as I might have done in the past. Indeed, the association is improving, and the Minister for Housing and Communities, Alex Neil, and the new chief executive of the GHA, Martin Armstrong, should take some credit for that.</p><p>Although the GHA is improving, it started from a dreadfully low and poor base. I will give two examples of the GHA's work as a factor. Owners who dispute bills for major works find it virtually impossible to get a full breakdown of how bills were arrived at by the GHA or a specific scheme of works for their own properties, with appropriate costings. One of my constituents got a retrospective scheme of works&#8212;in other words, it was drafted following the completion of the works, rather than in advance of any of the works commencing or taking place. When the GHA was asked about how costs were arrived at between itself and City Building (Glasgow), it hid behind commercial confidentiality.</p><p>A second issue that I am dealing with relates to home owners whose properties are factored by the GHA. Each home owner has paid &#163;6,000 to have their home cladded to improve energy efficiency and address fuel poverty. There now appears to be a serious damp problem in those properties, which has to be investigated. We will see whether the GHA, as the factor, has let down those home owners.</p><p>I thoroughly agree with the dispute resolution approach. Because of the Conservatives' right-to-buy policy, many people who now own their home could never have afforded to own and maintain a home previously. We must consider credit solutions for home owners who cannot afford to pay for the upkeep of their properties.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20666033", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Factoring Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in this debate on factoring services.

Where genuine concerns were raised, they were listened to and the bill has been shaped by the Parliament as it has gone through. That is the way that all legislation should go through this Parliament.</p><p>I will give some context to the bill. In 2004, the United Kingdom figure for repossessions was around 8,000. Despite the fact that the Council of Mortgage Lenders has revised the figure expected in the coming year down&#8212;I think to 48,000&#8212;in 2008 the figure was 40,000, which is still a huge increase in the number of repossessions over a four-year period.</p><p>I say to David McLetchie that just as Nero fiddled while Rome burned, if the Conservatives had their way, they would be sitting on their hands while vulnerable home owners had their homes repossessed. It is vital that we act, and the bill will ensure that we do.</p><p>There should be a Scottish figure for repossessions, but we have some data. We know <place-holder colnum=\"23741\"/> that there has been a 77 per cent hike in the number of mortgages that have been in arrears for three months or more, which shows that more people are getting into mortgage difficulty. We also know that between 2008 and 2009, courts in Scotland granted more repossessions&#8212;the figure rose from 67 per cent to 75 per cent. There is an evidence base there. We also know that between December 2008 and December 2009, 21 per cent more actions to repossess were initiated in courts. The evidence is clear: we have to act.</p><p>That is why the Scottish Government has moved to introduce statutory pre-action requirements. I give credit to our neighbours in England who introduced the pre-action protocol. In looking at best practice elsewhere, we sought to improve on the pre-action protocol by putting pre-action requirements on a statutory footing.

The Scottish Government sought to put in the bill a provision that would ensure that sheriffs could award costs against lenders should they move to repossess via a court and that repossession fails. Shelter, Citizens Advice Scotland and Money Advice Scotland drew to my attention the fact that under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970&#8212;under the terms of standard conditions of security&#8212;it would be permissible for a mortgage lender to rack up thousands of pounds in legal fees while attempting to repossess a vulnerable person's home. Although a Scottish sheriff could say that it had failed to meet the statutory requirement to be reasonable in seeking a proper credit solution and could award costs against the mortgage company, under the same act, it is also permissible for the lender to introduce back-door charges, so the legal fee could be added directly to the debt of the vulnerable home owner. I find that unacceptable, which is why I worked with Shelter to lodge an amendment on that at stage 2.</p><p>However, I did not know at that point that that would impinge upon the regulation of financial services, which is outwith the terms of the Scotland Act 1998. I thank the minister for his <place-holder colnum=\"23742\"/> reassurance that he will work with me on that. He has written to Lord Myners to raise the point with him. It makes no difference to me whether the UK Government legislates to end those unfair back-door charges or whether it gives Scotland the power to do so. I just want to help vulnerable home owners and I hope that we can all unite around that. I will certainly write to Lord Myners, too.</p><p>I am absolutely delighted with one or two other aspects of the bill. I am delighted to see provision for lay representation in Scottish courts. The experts who have helped vulnerable home owners from the first point at which they access debt advice to the end point, when they face repossession of their homes&#8212;Shelter, Money Advice Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland&#8212;are the very people who should be in court. I thank the minister for his reassurance about voluntary surrender and ask him to keep a weather eye on how that process works.</p><p>I am delighted that section 10 has remained intact.

My next comment was aimed at the Labour benches but, given the pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance that is Mr Purvis on the Liberal Democrat front bench, I will instead aim it at him: arguments such as his make people look very foolish indeed.</p><p>Within the context of a shrinking Scottish budget, it is heartening to see a larger share of the spending cake being given to councils than was the case in previous years. This is the third consecutive year under this Government that that has happened. Over the past three years, under the Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive, the figure went down, down, down.</p><p>It is, however, fair to say that, even given the average real-terms increase to councils of 1.4 per cent, there are difficult times ahead for local authorities. The increase is not brilliant but, given the current financial predicament, it is not bad at all. In particular, modest&#8212;at best&#8212;budget increases are to be expected in future years. That will lead to challenges for local authorities, including my own in Glasgow.</p><p>I could put the boot into Labour-controlled Glasgow City Council by going on about the mass closure of primary schools or Steven Purcell not believing in lower class sizes, but I will, instead, look at things from another angle. Councils plan their budgets over the medium term; they must take the decisions that they feel are right for them. That is what Glasgow City Council is doing, even if I disagree with its actions. One decision that it has taken on which I agree is its democratic decision to&#8212;once again&#8212;freeze the council tax. The people of Glasgow welcome that, as will people across Scotland, hopefully in every local authority area. That is what will be achieved this afternoon if we vote for the order.</p><p>During such hard-pressed times as these, the council tax freeze is particularly welcome. Over a three-year period, it amounts to &#163;160 million in people's pockets, once baselining of the &#163;40 million per annum is accounted for. That is very welcome indeed.</p><p>I turn to Derek Brownlee's speech and his point that the funding distribution mechanism under the Scottish Government is identical to that of the Labour-Liberal Democrat Executive. If different MSPs in different parts of the country are not <place-holder colnum=\"23679\"/> happy with the settlement in their area, they should come to the chamber and say how they would unpick it. They would have to tell us which part of the country they would take money from in order to give money to their area.</p><p>This is a fair budget settlement for local authorities. It is rising in real terms and local authorities are getting a larger slice of the spending cake than ever before.

As a Glasgow MSP, I will focus on what has become the most controversial part of the budget process&#8212;the cancellation of the Glasgow airport rail link.</p><p>When the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth first announced the cancellation of GARL, I was disappointed. That was one of the toughest calls that I have known since I became an MSP in 2007. I did not want such a significant capital project to be cancelled&#8212;none of us did. I remember walking down the stairs outside the chamber to the garden lobby immediately after the statement and having a discussion with Margaret Curran about GARL. During that conversation, she asked me whether I would join a cross-party initiative to get GARL reinstated, and I said that I would be happy to do so. However, my condition was that we would campaign together on two fronts, making representations to both Westminster and Holyrood. My offer to Margaret Curran, which was genuine, was rejected.</p><p>With a reduction in Scotland's capital budget from 2010-11 onwards, and with as yet unknown cuts from 2011-12 onwards, it was unrealistic to expect that Scotland's capital investment programme could remain intact without the co-operation of the UK Government&#8212;co-operation that was not forthcoming. That gives the lie to Wendy Alexander's slippage statements, which deny the fact that the capital budget is shrinking. All indicators point to deeper cuts to the Scottish budget in future years, and there is no sign of Scotland being afforded borrowing powers to allow the Scottish Parliament&#8212;if we chose to do so&#8212;to borrow to invest in the capital projects that are <place-holder colnum=\"22912\"/> now under threat. In that context, I see no way of reinstating GARL without the axe falling somewhere else. That is how things currently stand.</p><p>That being so, why was GARL being cancelled such a tough call for me as a Glasgow MSP? It was tough because, as an MSP, many factors influence me. Primarily, I am here to represent my constituents, which means that I fight for them and stand up for them. That core responsibility of an MSP means that we all have to decide whether to try to get the best deal for our constituents or a fair deal for our constituents, which can present us with a moral dilemma. I believe that Glasgow gets a fair deal from the Scottish Government. Other members in this Parliament must also decide whether to fight for a fair deal for their area or the best deal.

Only two are left in the chamber, and I am quite concerned about their wellbeing.</p><p>I want to declare an interest in today's debate. My mother and father are in receipt of attendance allowance and carers allowance, so this is a real family situation for me.</p><p>Most people should be sympathetic to the idea of reforming the benefits regime in England and Wales to provide better services for those who are most in need: I know that I am. However, any increase in social provision must be paid for somehow, and whether the scheme is affordable will be the UK Government's main consideration when deciding whether to implement its policy. Numerous areas of Government spending could be curtailed to increase that provision. I will not make party-political points about the things that I would cut, but we are certainly starting to get a full picture of the Labour Government's staggering past and present waste. Parliament needs to send out the message today that when the UK Government goes looking for cash to pay for any new schemes, it should look elsewhere, because this Parliament will fight to protect the dignity of up to 168,000 Scottish elderly disabled citizens whose income is being put at risk by the UK Labour Party.</p><p>We are talking not about luxury items but about the most basic level of financial support for many <place-holder colnum=\"22832\"/> people who are leading considerably more difficult lives than many of us lead. It does not matter how hard the two Labour members who are in the chamber at the moment try to dress up the proposals, they will take money away from Scottish pensioners. It could not be clearer. Labour Party interests and the interests of Scotland's most vulnerable citizens are in direct conflict. It is simply not decent to come to the chamber and pretend that the green paper is anything other than a stated intention to scrap attendance allowance, and to save money by paying less to those who are in need in order to commit to higher expenditure and social care provision in England and Wales. Labour seems to be saying that somehow it will not really affect Scotland. How can that be? Where is the detail to support such claims? It is certainly not in the green paper.</p><p>What about the knock-on effects? In the city of Glasgow area that I represent, there are more than 8,400 carers allowance claimants. If attendance allowance is a required benefit for claiming carers allowance, will that knock out the other benefit? What about informal care arrangements with family members and friends? Where is the recognition of the enormous efforts of those unpaid carers when attendance allowance payments barely cover additional expenses?</p><p>The only thing that seems clear in the green paper is that Labour is getting rid of attendance allowance. I say that because I have not heard one Labour MP or MSP rule it out. If the paper is a consultation, let me hear someone on the Labour benches rule out scrapping attendance allowance&#8212;now is their opportunity. I see that two more Labour members are with us, but the quicksand seems to have been replaced by tumbleweed and silence. As I said, the only thing that is clear in the green paper is that Labour wants to get rid of attendance allowance, which I believe is wrong.</p><p>As Labour members have refused to rule it out, they must think that I am wrong and that I am misinforming people. Therefore, they think that Age Concern, Help the Aged, the Royal National Institute of Blind People and Leonard Cheshire Disability are wrong and are misinforming people. That is if we believe the Labour argument, but I do not accept or believe it. According to Labour, the institute for social and economic research must be wrong, too, when it says that the measures could force 40 per cent of attendance allowance recipients below the poverty line. Even the former First Minister Jack McConnell must be wrong. By goodness, he was wrong on many things, but on this one he is certainly right.</p><p>Let us not beat about the bush: it is not good enough simply to say that we do not yet have the <place-holder colnum=\"22833\"/> full detail&#8212;we know enough. The UK benefits system is infamously cumbersome and inflexible. If some members were not so dogmatically opposed to the Parliament having control over the tax and benefits system, we might get a real debate on how the proposals would impact on Scotland. As the system stands, I can see no workable way for attendance allowance to be removed while simultaneously protecting the income levels of people who currently receive it. It is not clear from the green paper how any Barnett consequentials from social care spending in England will come to Scotland. We are not even sure whether the Scottish Parliament would be able to reinstate any lost income.</p><p>A similar situation has arisen with the Scottish Parliament's policy on kinship care. The UK tax and benefits system has not been flexible enough to allow us to top up the income of vulnerable people who are kinship carers using our Scottish block grant. If we did that, the UK tax and benefits system would take it away. The system is inflexible and cumbersome and we have no way of knowing whether it will be any better under the robbing of attendance allowance that the Labour Party proposes. I doubt very much that it will be.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20497982", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am wondering whether there is some quicksand in the chamber today, because the longer the debate goes on, the more Labour members seem to be sinking away.

As a member of the Subordinate Legislation Committee during stage 1 and the publication of the stage 1 report, I must pay tribute to my fellow committee members, the committee clerks, the legal team and the Scottish Government bill team for their hard work and co-operation. I have to say that I found the task to be rather dry, unglamorous and challenging, so I must apologise to members on the committee who have been secretly enthralled by the process and those on the legal team who cannot get enough of this bill. To be honest, it is not really for me.</p><p>However, dry though the whole matter might have been, the bill is still very important. In a small yet significant way it represents a spreading of the Scottish Parliament's wings away from the three transitional orders that empowered it to make and interpret acts of the Scottish Parliament. As those transitional orders were based on the UK Interpretation Act 1978, it is only right that, after 10 years of devolution, we review the situation and introduce new legislation.</p><p>As members have already pointed out, in its stage 1 report the committee could not reach a clear consensus on a number of aspects. One of the key elements of part 2, which seeks to implement the recommendations of the 2007 inquiry into the regulatory framework in Scotland, is the increase from 21 to 28 days in the period after which a negative instrument should come into force. I welcome the Scottish Government's acceptance of that recommendation; however, at committee, some members decided that we should go further than 28 days. Indeed, as we have heard, 40 days was suggested. Like other members, I was somewhat surprised by the proposal, given that the recommendation to <place-holder colnum=\"22667\"/> increase the period to 28 days had been made in 2007.</p><p>I believe that a 40-day period would completely knock out of kilter the delicate balancing act between the Scottish Government's need to act with purpose and effectiveness and the need for strong parliamentary scrutiny. As Margaret Curran said, it would make it difficult to keep</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the show on the road\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Subordinate Legislation Committee</em>, 21 November 2006; c 2131.]</p><p>in ensuring effective use of subordinate legislation. Given that there appears to be no real evidence of the benefits of a move to 40 days, I suggest to Parliament that a 28-day period strikes the right balance.</p><p>Neither was there consensus in the committee about the period within which a negative instrument can be annulled. When, in response to a wish that was expressed by certain members to extend the period from 40 to 50 days, ministers outlined the kind of parliamentary timetabling problems that such a move might throw up, the same members said that the Government was deliberately picking worst-case scenarios. However, it was that very line of argument from some Opposition members that made me move towards the Government position. Put simply, I would expect any Government of whatever party to take account of worst-case scenarios and to take steps to avoid such situations. For that reason, I am minded to back the Government's current position, although I want to hear what members have to say as we go through the rest of the parliamentary process.</p><p>I have also been led to believe that under the previous Executive as well as under this Government, the spread of subordinate legislation has been rather uneven, with a glut of activity after recesses resulting in a pile of SSIs being sent to the Subordinate Legislation Committee. I do not accept that the previous Executive was, or that this Government is, incapable of improving the timetabling of subordinate legislation to avoid such surges of activity, particularly after the summer recess; indeed, the Subordinate Legislation Committee in the second session highlighted the same problem. A move to 50 days would only make matters worse.</p><p>Although I have drawn attention to differences within the committee, I have to say that members largely united around the bill's general principles. I will give it a fair wind this afternoon, and hope that Parliament will come together to support it.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20495384", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate.

The bill will be a powerful tool to protect family homes from repossession and to ensure that effective debt <place-holder colnum=\"22384\"/> solutions exist for the many vulnerable individuals and families who are caught in an inescapable debt trap. That debt trap is often due to current defective legislation. Therefore, as we enter the holiday period, we should remember that the bill provides an example of what this Parliament can do when we put our minds to it.</p><p>I hope that stages 2 and 3 of the bill can be completed very early in the new year. All of us in the Parliament have a responsibility to seek consensus where possible and to agree on a reasoned compromise where it is appropriate to do so. Indeed, I believe that ministers were in listening mode throughout stage 1, so I look forward to seeing what will emerge during stage 2.</p><p>I want to cast an eye south of the border. Some unionist colleagues might anticipate that every comparison drawn with England is an attempt to play party politics, but I can assure them otherwise. It is believed that England has had some success with the pre-action protocol, which is a list of best-practice protocols that lenders should go through before seeking repossession. Indeed, Labour members have spoken highly of such protocols in previous months. As Alex Neil mentioned, under the protocol&#8212;which is clearly a step forward&#8212;around one third of cases are still not dealt with appropriately. The move to put the pre-action protocol on a statutory basis in Scotland, combined with the provisions that will require all repossession cases to appear in court and&#8212;just as important&#8212;enable statutory pre-action requirements to be tested in court, will give this Parliament an incredibly strong and powerful framework for dealing with repossessions in Scotland. I believe that the bill will put Scotland ahead of its closest neighbours in tackling repossessions, but the progressive legislation in England is what has led us to this point.</p><p>Another provision in part 1 that I want to highlight is the right to representation in court by a lay representative. I believe that, in years to come, this Parliament will view that practice as commonplace and will wonder why it took us all so long to allow people from organisations such as debt action Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland to provide such representation in court. After all, such organisations often support families with debt and repossession issues, providing vital support, building up trust and giving advice along the way. In many circumstances, they are best placed to defend repossession actions in court.</p><p>Much has been said about part 2 of the bill. It is vital that we ensure that part 2 is as good as it can be and that all that is good about it is not lost as the bill progresses. We should not let the consultation issue get in the way of that. I see nothing in part 2 that cannot be retained, either in its current form or following further clarification <place-holder colnum=\"22385\"/> or&#8212;if need be&#8212;amendment. I believe that our committee agrees, which is why, despite the concerns about consultation, we all agree to the general principles of both parts of the bill.</p><p>Mr McLetchie was extremely critical of part 2. He evoked Bob the Builder in asking whether we could fix it. Although he hoped that we could, in much of his speech he appeared to suggest that the only tool that the Conservatives would use would be the spanner that they would throw in the works. I strongly hope that that is not the case.</p><p>I would not claim that Labour has similar intentions&#8212;I believe that its members will be constructive, even though I may not agree with Cathy Jamieson's or David Whitton's choice of language to describe the bill. It is the Government's responsibility to produce draft legislation and it is the Parliament's job to improve and amend it as appropriate, and I genuinely believe that Labour will work in partnership to achieve that aim.</p><p>I turn to the certificate for sequestration, which is vital. There are people out there who are caught in debt quicksand and are sinking fast. If someone has too high an income to make an application to the low-income, low-asset debtor scheme but does not earn enough to participate in a debt arrangement scheme or a protected trust deed, they are at the behest of their creditors. CAS has huge concerns about that and wants there to be no delay in the taking of action. It believes that any delay will result in another year of misery for many people in Scotland. The certificate for sequestration would solve the problem. So far, the biggest concern about it that I have heard is that the system might be overly bureaucratic, but I suspect that that is always the complaint whenever a new system comes in. It is for the Government to get that aspect right.</p><p>In the time that I have got left, I want to deal with the biggest red herring, which relates to protected trust deeds. It will not become compulsory to remove the family home from a protected trust deed; the bill will just make it legal to do so, which, at the moment, it is not. The bill simply provides another tool in the box for dealing with repossessions and securing family homes. I see no reason why creditors cannot make a debt arrangement to exclude a family home, regardless of the level of equity that is contained in it. I am open minded about whether we need guidelines, but I make it clear that as long as we are talking about a negotiated settlement that is not forced on the sector, there is no issue&#8212;it is a red herring.</p><p>I believe that the Parliament will come together on the bill's general principles, and I look forward to stage 2, when I hope that a constructive partnership will be developed that will save people <place-holder colnum=\"22386\"/> from repossessions and provide them with debt solutions.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20463950", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This afternoon's debate provides a fitting end to the current parliamentary term: there will be many things on which our parties disagree, but the passage of the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill through its stage 1 committee scrutiny will, in my opinion, be a shining example of the parties coming together to get the job done.

We are not there, but we are getting there. Since May 2007&#8212;month in, month out&#8212;unemployment has been lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. The success of the Scottish Government in curtailing the worst effects of the recession has been undermined by drastic cuts in the Scottish budget. The chancellor's forecasts are now something of a running joke&#8212;if only this were a laughing matter. Labour has not got a clue on the economy. Without the return of Scottish revenues to Scotland, the nation is being bled dry. Capital acceleration is needed now for housing, infrastructure projects and job creation&#8212;all the essential components of economic recovery.</p><p>History tells us that Labour in Scotland will sit back and let Labour and Tory Governments in London act without regard to the Scottish interest. Labour members are today arguing the same old line. Without the powers that the Scottish Parliament needs, no Scottish Government&#8212;regardless of the party that is in administration&#8212;can protect the nation from Westminster cuts. The &#163;350 million capital shortfall for 2010-11 will result in the loss of affordable housing, the loss of an estimated 5,000 jobs and the loss of essential projects.</p><p>When the Glasgow airport rail link was cancelled, Labour was first to point out the potential for associated job losses for the city.

Let's go and see Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown and demand that these cuts don't happen.\" Margaret Curran walked away. I now say to Steven Purcell in relation to the 4,000 potential job losses in Glasgow and the slashing of voluntary sector budgets, \"I will stand should to shoulder with you to protect vulnerable people and jobs in Glasgow, but we must take the campaign to Downing Street&#8212;to the people who hold the financial purse strings and are making the cuts.\" The offer is there.</p><p>Andy Kerr did not call for capital acceleration today; neither did Wendy Alexander.

Perhaps the Liberal Democrats think that Mike Russell and COSLA's Pat Watters should take a blood brothers' pledge to rebuild that bond of trust. I can see it now: Mike Russell could be Huckleberry Finn to Pat Watters's Tom Sawyer in some <em>Boy's Own</em> adventure. I make light of the situation for a very good reason. By talking about rebuilding a bond of trust, the Liberal Democrats overegg their argument. To suggest that local authorities, which have all agreed to freeze the council tax for two consecutive years, do not have a working relationship&#8212;sorry, a \"bond of trust\"&#8212;with the Scottish Government is clearly nonsense.</p><p>It is unfair for councils to be lumped together in such a way. Is the bond of trust broken in East Lothian or Perth, where more teachers are being employed? How about the 19 local authorities where primary school class sizes fell over the past year? Is the bond of trust shattered in East Ayrshire, where there has been a 33.7 per cent increase in the number of P1 to P3 classes of 18 and under over the past year? Of course not.

It has been challenging to work in partnership with local authorities to achieve that. The figures are clear, as are the challenges, and no one is trying to run away from that. Several local authorities could have and should have done better. That is a genuine frustration. However, tabloid headline-grabbing phrases like \"education in crisis\" and \"rebuilding bonds of trust\" are just that: they might deliver newspaper headlines, but they do not deliver any form of constructive opposition. I say again: I do not believe that the Liberal Democrats want to use education as a political football. There is a genuine opportunity to engage with the Scottish Government, but the Liberal Democrats' motion has missed it. They could have provided constructive opposition, but they have chosen not to. I hope that they will reflect on that, as there is a way forward together if they choose, dare I say it, to grasp the thistle.</p><p>We have a new education minister, and there are challenges ahead. It would be more appropriate if Opposition parties were positive and constructive. We have to bear responsibilities, as a Scottish Government, and those responsibilities are clear.

Every witness told us that they were keen to find a way forward on equal pay. Everyone said that they wanted to ensure that people who had suffered discrimination in pay over many years would be compensated and that equal pay for all workers, particularly low-paid women workers, would be guaranteed. COSLA said that it wanted to resolve the equal pay claims, as did the trade unions and individual local authorities. However, there are agreements that date back to 1987, and an agreement between COSLA and the trade unions in 1999 to resolve the issue by 2002 was subsequently extended to 2004. There was no resolution then, and there is no resolution now.</p><p>In a report in 2006, the Finance Committee said that the matter should be dealt with within 12 months, but it was not. We are still waiting.</p><p>Everyone told us that they wanted to deal with the equal pay claims, but 35,000 tribunal claims are still outstanding. Low-paid female workers need action, not just kind words. It is time for local authorities to get real with regard to their approach to equal pay claims. They must put equal treatment of their female workers on an even footing with their own financial interests.</p><p>The reality check for local authorities was summed up by Alex McLuckie from the GMB union, who said in evidence to our committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The range of offers, rather than settlements, was from about 48 per cent to about 95 per cent of what could reasonably be expected to be won at tribunal. That is quite a difference.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 11 March 2000; c 1785.]</p><p>Anecdotally, I have heard of one case in which a tribunal awarded a worker &#163;30,000, but the offer from the local authority had been only &#163;3,000. Why would a low-paid woman worker accept &#163;3,000 from a local authority when a tribunal would award &#163;30,000? Local authorities need a <place-holder colnum=\"20176\"/> reality check. If local authorities are going to offer 48 per cent of what female workers are owed, as Alex McLuckie said, why would anyone take that option? Nobody would settle for that figure.</p><p>The committee heard from Philip Barr, from the City of Edinburgh Council, who said that the city would settle cases that it could not win. He called that a \"no-brainer\", and I agree. It is also a no-brainer to acknowledge that, unless councils get real with their offers to female workers, recourse to a tribunal will be the only option for many.</p><p>At the Local Government and Communities Committee, I asked unions and COSLA whether they would consider working more imaginatively to achieve the settlement of equal pay claims. I also asked whether they would consider the option of spreading phased or staggered repayments over a number of years. Both sides said that they would consider that, and such a recommendation is contained in the committee's report.</p><p>In 2008, Audit Scotland said that council reserves were &#163;530 million. Some &#163;33 million of that was said to be set aside for equal pay claim liabilities. Staged payments, together with action by the Scottish Government to work with local authorities and the UK Treasury to raise funds via capitalisation, mean that it is finally possible for local authorities to deliver for low-paid workers. The excuses are running out.</p><p>Many members have mentioned how wary people who are involved in equal pay disputes are about showing their hand during any discussions and negotiations. We have heard that that is due to the highly litigious nature of the issue. However, that approach is self-defeating. The greater the delay, the greater the scope for lawyers to have their merry way.</p><p>It is a matter of regret that COSLA and local authorities have chosen not to deal with the issue of equal pay at national level. That was a serious mistake, which has led to an unclear, patchwork quilt approach to equal pay being taken across Scotland. With the possible consequences of the Bainbridge ruling still to be considered, it is vital that a similar patchwork quilt approach is not taken by Scotland's local authorities and unions in that regard. That is why I strongly endorse the recommendation that, in addition to the publication of advice and guidance, COSLA should consider whether a framework agreement, with the suggested payment matrix, could be put together to deal with Bainbridge. A patchwork quilt approach will fail low-paid female workers. All that such an approach will do is to keep lawyers warm and wealthy&#8212;it will do nothing to help the people whom the report is aimed at helping.<place-holder colnum=\"20177\"/></p><p>I welcome the report, and I hope that it is the last one that the Parliament has to produce in an attempt to deal with the issue of equal pay.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20200694", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Official Report 1 October 2009: \"Equal Pay in Local Government\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Local Government and Communities Committee clerks, the SPICe team, my fellow committee members and the committee convener, Duncan McNeil, for the work that they have done on the report that is before us.

The issue has also thrown up a huge challenge for people elsewhere. That is certainly the case in Fife, where there is a real prospect of an increase in Diageo's workforce as a result of the closure of the Port Dundas and Kilmarnock sites. That has placed workers, unions, communities and politicians in Fife in an invidious position. No one wanted to be seen as promoting jobs in one community at the expense of misery in another. I am pleased that that has not happened. Of course, it is only natural for people in Fife to welcome the job creation and expansion in their <place-holder colnum=\"19682\"/> area, but the workers, unions, communities and politicians there have seen the bigger picture. We have not been pitched against one another in our struggle for jobs; rather, we have remained united across party-political lines and across regions.</p><p>We must all remember that, although we are discussing proposals that affect communities in Glasgow and Kilmarnock today, it could be other members' communities tomorrow. I need not look very far to illustrate that. For instance, job losses are pending in Livingston. I wish Angela Constance MSP and the workers who face unemployment as a result of the Bausch and Lomb closure my best in attempting to protect jobs. We must remain united and ensure that we support jobs in our communities wherever and whenever they are threatened, whether that is in Glasgow, Kilmarnock, Livingston or Fife.</p><p>Much has been said about the efforts to save the Diageo jobs. Although the occasional comment might have been out of step with the united efforts, by and large, people in the task force and beyond have remained united and solidarity has been shown. I pay tribute to all those involved. I note that there is no Labour amendment, and I very much welcome the joint approach from Scotland's two main parties to dealing with job losses. It is absolutely vital that the Scottish National Party, our party of Government in Scotland, and Labour, our main Opposition party, stay united in our efforts to support Diageo workers and to mitigate the effects of the looming job losses. Dealing with those job losses is not about politicians; rather, it is about the workers, the unions and the communities around Port Dundas and Kilmarnock, who need our continued help and assistance. I am encouraged that the motion speaks about supporting the continued work of the task force, as that is vital.</p><p>I strongly welcome the fact that the trade unions are actively attempting to extend the life of the Port Dundas site beyond the closure date that Diageo proposes. I urge Diageo to review its proposed closure date and to give real consideration to the possibility that Cameronbridge will not be fully up and running by that time. I ask Diageo once more to review the risk of centralising much of its white and dark spirit distillation in one location, with a view to buying any shortfalls on the open market. A market upturn in sales or an unforeseen problem with the centralised distillation facility could leave Diageo seriously exposed in meeting spirit demand. Even at this late stage, an extended lifespan for Port Dundas might be not only socially responsible in relation to the Glasgow workforce, but prudent for Diageo in business terms. I welcome the Scottish Government's continued support for the unions in their efforts to press Diageo on that.<place-holder colnum=\"19683\"/></p><p>I pay massive tribute to the workers and unions, who, for example, showed a willingness to demonstrate wage constraint way before the prospect of closure was on the horizon. Workers and unions were already responding to challenging times, because they were realistic about the need for change, but also committed to Diageo. John Swinney has outlined how the task force closed the value gap between Diageo's plans for closure and the task force's alternatives. I have said before in the Parliament that Diageo must get the balance right between maximising its profits and meeting its social responsibilities. If that balance is not struck, we have unfettered capitalism, which benefits no community in Scotland or anywhere in the world. I believe that Diageo has got the balance wrong with the closure, but it must now ensure that it meets its social responsibilities by assisting with regeneration in the affected areas. I pledge to do all that I can to assist in Port Dundas. The site has a prime location, just north of Glasgow city centre and set above the M8 motorway. Whatever the future for the site, whether commercial, residential or mixed use, we must ensure that jobs are created for the local community and that the community is consulted on the plans.</p><p>I reiterate my strong belief that the unions still have an incredibly good case for extending the life of the Port Dundas distillery. Diageo has nothing to lose and everything to gain by doing that. As other members have said, the longer the site remains open and workers are employed there, the greater the opportunity for the task force and the Scottish Government to reskill workers and diversify employment in the area. I pay tribute once more to all who are involved in the campaign. I have been proud to be part of it and I will continue to help the communities and workers in my constituency who have lost out.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Diageo"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Diageo's proposals for closures and job losses in Glasgow and Kilmarnock have thrown up many challenges for all those who have done all that they can to save a future for workers in our communities.

I thank Partick Thistle for hosting that meeting and I commend Partick Thistle and Kilmarnock Football Club on their support for their local communities. I also commend other politicians who have strained every sinew to save jobs, including Willie Coffey, Des Browne and Patricia Ferguson.</p><p>Central to my concerns as a Glasgow MSP is how the workers at Port Dundas have been treated. They recently showed loyalty to Diageo by <place-holder colnum=\"19176\"/> accepting a pay deal that showed great restraint. They have continued to consider ways of improving working practices to make them more efficient for the company&#8212;they are a committed work force. The reason for the pay restraint and for the flexibility in relation to working practices was that the workforce was led to believe that that would secure jobs. Workers at Port Dundas have invested by the sweat of their brow in Diageo. All they ask is that the same loyalty and respect be shown to the workforce by the company. As we have heard, the other day Diageo announced operating profits of &#163;2.6 billion&#8212;a 4 per cent increase&#8212;with &#163;1.2 billion going to its shareholders.</p><p>Let us be clear: Port Dundas makes Diageo money and Kilmarnock makes Diageo money. The company is not cash strapped. The issue is whether Diageo maximises its profits at the expense of its loyal and hard-working workforce and their communities and, in doing so, damages its brand image. I am sure that the proposals that will be put to Diageo by the Scottish Government task force will consider ways to make the retention of operations at Port Dundas and Kilmarnock more attractive to Diageo. I very much hope that Diageo will listen and realise that a balance between unfettered profits and meaningful corporate and social responsibility&#8212;including investment in communities&#8212;must be struck. In the long term, investing in communities will strengthen the brand and increase profitability. It is also the right thing to do.</p><p>I support Willie Coffey and Linda Fabiani's calls for an inquiry into the whisky industry. I have spoken to Diageo and it is clearly choosing to buy white spirit from rivals or to produce it at distilleries in which it has part ownership. There appears to be an awful cosiness between companies that are otherwise market rivals. Perhaps that needs to be examined, along with other parts of the industry.</p><p>The Scottish Government-led task force has concerns over the extent of the exposure Diageo is leaving itself open to in the marketplace. Patricia Ferguson and David Whitton mentioned the danger of Diageo putting all its eggs in one basket. I agree with that analysis. I believe that the way ahead is to continue with the Port Dundas distillery for the next few years. We need to work with Diageo to reduce overheads and analyse how to help it with its cost base. In two years, the market could look very different.</p><p>Diageo markets Johnnie Walker as Scotland in a glass. It views the dram that people take worldwide as a premium Scottish product. It must now pay a premium to Scotland's communities and invest in Kilmarnock and Glasgow.

However, as I am a Glasgow MSP, members would expect me to focus on the elements that will directly affect my constituents.</p><p>Glasgow has just gone through a sweeping and brutal series of school closures&#8212;eleven primary schools and nine nursery schools were axed. I know at first hand how, when a local authority gets it badly wrong in relation to school closures, the pain is felt by the whole community, particularly the children and parents who are affected. Such open wounds will take a long time to heal in my city, and I suspect that many parents and their families will never forgive Glasgow City Council.<place-holder colnum=\"19122\"/></p><p>I believe that when a local authority is planning a fundamental alteration to the school estate, such as was planned in Glasgow, it is not good enough for proposals to appear as a bolt from the blue. Once a council has put forward a strategy for closing and merging a raft of schools, I suspect that that council's views become entrenched and that the ruling council group becomes defensive with regard to any criticism of such proposals. That might be the case irrespective of the council and the party that is in control.</p><p>In Glasgow, many parents read about the closure proposals in the newspapers before they got a letter from the council. That is not acceptable. The anger about that, and the feeling that secret schemes were being cooked up in back rooms for months, while everyone else was none the wiser, meant that the proposals did not go down well.

Communities can respect decisions with which they disagree, but only if they feel that they have themselves been respected. I ask the minister to consider whether, as part of the bill, the Government would be open to making provisions for pre-consultation guidelines.</p><p>Another aspect of the bill concerns the involvement of HMIE, which I strongly endorse. I note that HMIE will not be expected to attend consultation meetings, but it is important that it attend at least some. I am open minded about whether that means that it should attend meetings at a fixed amount of schools within any school closure programme, or whether it should have more of a roving role to evaluate the effectiveness of such meetings. It is clear from the Glasgow <place-holder colnum=\"19123\"/> experience that such meetings were poorly run and organised, and did not allow parents a genuine opportunity to express their views or to feel that they had been listened to.</p><p>I will give an example. If a parent raises fears about possible territorialism issues that might arise if their child's school should close, they would expect to be listened to, as opposed to being told on the night that there are well-established criteria to eliminate such problems. That should also be the case for matters such as safe walking routes to school or child care facilities&#8212;parents were told not to worry about such matters, and their questions were answered, on the very same evening as the public consultation meeting. Parents were not looking for slick presentations at consultation meetings from council officials with pre-rehearsed answers to justify all aspects of closure; they simply wanted to feel that they were being listened to. In Glasgow, 96 per cent of 8,000 respondents to the consultation among parents and communities objected to closure plans because they felt that they had been completely ignored.</p><p>There is clearly a need for some form of quality control within that aspect of any consultation process. It has to be monitored somehow, which may be a role for HMIE. If there is no independent assessment of the quality of consultations, many parents will feel that local authorities are not listening to them or conducting the process openly and transparently. I urge that consideration be given to how we monitor the quality of such consultation meetings, and to whether HMIE could be the body to do that job, although I am open to suggestions on other bodies.</p><p>There is much to be welcomed in the bill; I specifically welcome the extension of the list of consultees and I am delighted that teaching staff may now be allowed to have their say during a consultation. In Glasgow, I have heard some stories about quiet words being had with staff to remind them that the council are their employers and that it would be best if they said nothing. The teaching union Educational Institute of Scotland was rather muted about the Glasgow proposals, and I know that individual teachers would have liked the protection and the right to speak their minds in public.</p><p>I welcome the educational benefit statement that will be part of the process for councils, although some guidance may be needed on it. It should be retitled as something along the lines of educational analysis statement, as to call it an educational benefits statement could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and lead to an automatic assumption that the altered provision will be of benefit, which is not necessarily the case.<place-holder colnum=\"19124\"/></p><p>Councils need to move to a culture in which they will alter or throw out their initial proposals because their consultation exercise has worked and they are responsible.

The equality of status and esteem that this Scottish Government has been developing with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities via the concordat and single outcome agreements means that local government and Scottish Parliament elections must have equal status. Having both elections on the same day has led to local government issues being swamped by national ones. We must ensure like never before that just as Governments should stand or fall on their records, so should our councils.</p><p>It is ironic that two aspects of today's parliamentary business that I have been involved with make the case for me. First, we took evidence at the Local Government and Communities Committee on the &#163;60 million town centre regeneration fund. Alex Neil, the Minister for Housing and Communities, said he hoped that there would be a healthy geographical spread of successful bids to the fund. However, he also made it clear that the quality of the bids was crucial. If a local authority were to make a poor and unimaginative or disappointing bid and it lost out, voters might wish to express an opinion about it at the ballot box.</p><p>Secondly, we had a statement on the Scottish Futures Trust and the school building programme only this afternoon. If a local authority does not make best use of its capital budget or makes a botched job of a Scottish Futures Trust bid, once again the electorate might wish to express a view at the ballot box. I picked those two examples not just because of their topicality, but because they are both Scotland-wide issues and, on another level, intimately local ones.</p><p>Decoupling will allow voters to decide clearly on the merits of both national Government and local government. Although the topics debated might sometimes be the same, the performance of Governments, Opposition parties in the Parliament and local authorities will vary depending on the topic under discussion. Decoupling will enhance the clarity and the scrutiny of their performance.

We believe that there was much below-the-radar spoiling of ballot papers in the local government elections, which was caused by misunderstanding. Many voters marked 1 and 2 on the paper and then, because of poor numeracy and literacy skills, marked 2 again.

I will return to that point later.</p><p>When the town centre regeneration fund was first announced, it was widely assumed that city-located town centres need not apply. There was a clear belief that towns were towns and cities were cities, but, in planning terms, that is not true. In taking up the campaign to ensure that our cities&#8212;including Glasgow, the city that I represent&#8212;did not miss out, I met Alex Neil, the Minister for Housing and Communities. I am delighted to say that the Scottish Government has ensured that cities can apply and has attempted to make the qualification criteria as flexible and inclusive as possible.</p><p>I have not left the matter there; I also met the head of Glasgow's development and regeneration services, Mr Steve Inch, and Cathy Laing, of the Glasgow North Regeneration Agency, to discuss possible bids. One of the bids is for Maryhill, so I declare an interest in the matter. Although I am a list MSP for the Glasgow region, I am a resident of Maryhill, which I consider to be home, after staying there for more than 10 years.</p><p>Maryhill is a proud community, but it is not without its problems. Like many areas, it suffers from high levels of poverty and social exclusion. The more prosperous members of our community are often drawn into the city centre to high-end shops and better amenities, or to the out-of-town shopping facilities with which other town centres have experienced problems. Those who remain are often from the lower income groups, and they are left with a relatively small amount of local facilities and poor amenities.</p><p>Communities should be able to celebrate their diversity, and social integration is a core element of any society. Maryhill needs more facilities that will benefit all who stay there&#8212;irrespective of their income level&#8212;and bring all parts of the wider Maryhill community together. I hope that the historical canal and botany areas, which are flanked by the barren valley area, will be at the heart of one of Glasgow's transformational regeneration areas. I hope that there will be a sizeable mix of housing developments, and a real opportunity to breathe life into an area that&#8212;as it has just lost two local schools&#8212;is crying out for amenities.</p><p>At the heart of the area sits Maryhill burgh halls&#8212;a once-proud building that now lies in ruins. However, it is rising from the ashes, and the Maryhill bid for the town centre regeneration fund is critical to the regeneration of the building. The plan for the new burgh halls is central to a &#163;1.8 million bid from Glasgow.<place-holder colnum=\"18233\"/></p><p>I will list for the minister some of the facilities that will be in the new burgh halls: a wide hall meeting area, a cafe with healthy eating options, a nursery offering up to 40 child care places, a garden courtyard civic meeting area, a gallery that will tell people about local history to build civic pride in the area, and even, believe it or not, a commercial recording studio. The project will provide child care for low-income families and create more than 100 jobs. Glasgow is asking for &#163;1.8 million to allow more than &#163;9 million to be invested. That really leverages in extra cash and, as the minister would say, is a big bang for the Government's buck.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "16044585", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporting Town Centres"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Aileen Campbell on bringing this important debate to the chamber.

The substantial amount of cash that has been levered in by the cashback for communities initiative is testament to Scotland's increasing success in tackling serious organised crime. From such success, communities should quite rightly reap benefit. That is the very essence of what cashback for communities is about.</p><p>Dirty money, built up on the pain and heartache of communities, is now being used to assist communities. Let me share with members my direct experience of that. After I was elected in 2007, one of my first visits was to operation reclaim, which is run jointly by Strathclyde Police and Sidekix with support from a variety of community partners. That day, I met Police Constable Harry Faulds, who was out playing a game of football with youngsters in the Milton area.</p><p>The Milton area is no stranger to serious organised crime; I made that point in a members' business debate that I secured in order to praise the community activists who have taken a stance against such crime. With members' indulgence, I will mention just a few of those activists. Alex O'Kane, for instance, has had his home and family targeted over the years because of his stand against drug dealers, who have for a long time peddled their misery in the local area and beyond. Indeed, only a few months ago, Alex O'Kane's house was subject to a reprisal petrol bomb attack. It would be wrong not to mention Councillor Billy McAllister, the local SNP councillor, who has also been subject to many serious threats against his person. Such people who take a stand in communities and become victims themselves need the Parliament's support.</p><p>Let me describe an incident that perhaps brings home the extent of the threat that exists in our communities. When Councillor McAllister and I held a public meeting in Lambhill&#8212;just along from the Milton community&#8212;just a few years ago, several hundred people attended. The MOT station next door to the meeting venue had been witness to the cold-blooded murder of a young <place-holder colnum=\"18027\"/> man whose family was allegedly involved in organised crime. The shooting happened just a few hours before the meeting took place. After our speaking out against such criminality and violence at the public meeting that night, a call was made to our local SNP mobile phone number, saying that criminals had been in attendance at the meeting. The anonymous caller said that, if people continued to speak out, people would be hurt. The threat was, \"Stay quiet or else.\" I mention that incident in today's debate because it is important that we never forget the pain and misery that such organised criminals cause to our communities. We must acknowledge the truly brave and heroic actions that communities take daily to stand up against the perpetrators of organised crime. It is just that the money that is recovered from such criminals is used to support our communities, and that is precisely what the cashback for communities scheme is doing in Milton and throughout north Glasgow.</p><p>I return to operation reclaim. The police and sports coaches are working with young people in various locations in north Glasgow. PC Harry Faulds plays football or rugby with young people who are at risk of falling into crime, as opposed to chasing them round the housing scheme. Such diversionary activities have broken down territorial boundaries and led to a dramatic fall in the local crime figures.</p><p>The cabinet secretary and the minister are aware of that. A few months ago, I visited Petershill Juniors during one of Mr MacAskill's ministerial visits. The Scottish Government had provided &#163;15,000 to operation reclaim for intensive work with 120 known gang members in the local area over a six-month period to turn them away from organised crime. Perhaps the cashback for communities scheme will allow such schemes to be expanded. Longer-term funding for large-scale diversionary activities such as operation reclaim, which could be enhanced and expanded, could be secured. That would be a positive thing. The existence of more large-scale projects with longer-term funding would represent a positive initiative for communities from the cashback for communities scheme.</p><p>Every penny that we spend on the cashback for communities scheme should improve the futures of our communities and reduce the number of youngsters who turn to crime and antisocial behaviour. In other words, we are talking about building a legacy. In our discussions in the chamber on the Commonwealth games in 2014, we have spoken a lot about building a legacy. I firmly believe that we should find a way of twinning the cashback for communities scheme's ability to fund a legacy by lifting communities out of the <place-holder colnum=\"18028\"/> grasp of organised criminals and raising the aspirations of the next generation with the hope and vibrancy that we wish to develop through having the Commonwealth games in Glasgow. The cabinet secretary should consider how the social legacy that we wish to build from the cashback for communities scheme and the Commonwealth games in Glasgow in 2014 can be developed through people working in partnership in a structured and co-ordinated fashion. I hope that that can be achieved, although I appreciate that the Commonwealth games legacy starts with a deficit of &#163;150 million.</p><p>I welcome the debate and its consensual nature. Before the debate, I looked at the figures for Glasgow. Sixteen cashback for communities projects were funded in the east end of Glasgow in the first two rounds of funding; the funding for those projects came to &#163;266,000. In the past couple of years, my city of Glasgow has received &#163;680,000. We should say thank you for that money, although we are entitled to it. As a Glasgow MSP, I want to get more money for Glasgow, which is natural, but we should clearly say that Glasgow receives cashback for communities money and benefits from it.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15015668", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cashback for Communities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It gives me great pleasure to speak in this afternoon's debate.

I have heard it said that the games are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Given that they will happen only once, that is true by definition. They are certainly a wonderful opportunity. However, the aspirations that we have for Scotland's largest city&#8212;Glasgow&#8212;and for our nation go far beyond winning and successfully running the 2014 Glasgow games.</p><p>Today we are here to talk about the legacy. One clear legacy not just for Glasgow but for Scotland will be that we will have put on a wonderful sporting event, on budget and with lasting social and economic benefits. I say \"Yes\" to all those things. However, by achieving them we will open the door to another lasting legacy for Scotland: when our nation shows itself to be capable of achieving such success, we will raise our profile and enhance our reputation on the international stage, which could lead to other major international events being hosted in Scotland.</p><p>I have in the past spoken at length about the need for a strong social legacy for Glasgow. As I have said, although a clutch of&#8212;I hope&#8212;gold medals, fond memories on the part of visitors to our city and a host of new and upgraded facilities will be welcome, those alone would be a poor show, given the opportunities that lie before us, so I am delighted that the Scottish Government's draft legacy plan goes far beyond that.</p><p>The idea of introducing, in conjunction with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and councils, a range of community sports hubs across Scotland is positive. I support that, but I stress that providing people who already exercise and who are already active in sport with better facilities is <place-holder colnum=\"16775\"/> not the best way forward. I hope that community sports hubs will be sited where participation in activities is lowest. The aim will be to bring together people from different ethnicities, income groups, ages and&#8212;this of particular importance in Glasgow&#8212;different territorial areas.</p><p>Positive health outcomes and the promotion of social inclusion must go hand in hand. It is fundamental that we inspire the youngsters who are most likely to find themselves alienated by society. That inspiration might be to be more physically active, to volunteer, to learn more about other cultures or to enhance their skills by gaining from the apprenticeships in Glasgow that will flow from the games. Whatever people are inspired to do, the key thing must be that they are inspired. That will not just happen, however&#8212;we all have a responsibility to plan and work for it. In that regard, our education establishments and the voluntary sector are key players.</p><p>I will give members a flavour of some of the projects in Glasgow that I believe could be key partners in inspiring Glaswegians and in building on the legacy. There is in Maryhill an organisation called realise community care project, which provides a supportive community education setting to help former addicts to build pre-employability skills and to support them in other ways. Phoenix Futures has in the north of the city a residential drug rehabilitation unit, which strives daily to turn lives around. Operation reclaim is a partnership between communities, Strathclyde Police and Sidekix. It uses Scottish Government money, via cashback for communities, and helps to break down territorial barriers by getting vulnerable youngsters involved in sport. We must find a way for the Commonwealth games legacy to help the people who benefit from such services to thrive. That is essential. I want those projects to develop and expand, and to be directly linked with Glasgow 2014. If the 2014 games pass people by, we will have let all Scotland down.</p><p>I am positive, however, and I commend the efforts that have been made to ensure that Scotland gets its fair share of lottery funding to finance legacy initiatives. I praise the Big Lottery Fund, whose communities 2014 fund is already awarding small community grants of up to &#163;1,000 to promote not just sport but, importantly, a variety of other physical activities for groups of people who are less likely to be involved in physical activity. That is entirely the right approach. It cannot be achieved without funding, but the Big Lottery Fund's approach is to maximise the benefit from whatever funding is available. I commend it for the attitude that it has shown.</p><p>I am delighted by much of what is contained in the draft legacy document. In particular, I note that <place-holder colnum=\"16776\"/> it discusses \"Enhancing Partnerships\" and \"Encouraging Community Engagement\".</p><p>I draw to Parliament's attention the fine work that Partick Thistle Football Club does&#8212;Margo MacDonald mentioned other football clubs. I joined Frank McAveety at Partick Thistle to promote the club letting under 16s into the ground for free, but the work that Partick Thistle does goes far beyond that. The club works with a variety of community groups, including the Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association and the mental health charity, the Scottish Association for Mental Health, to name just two. Partick Thistle does a lot of work with vulnerable groups of people who are not necessarily physically active, and does it on a shoestring budget. I ask the minister to join me and to come along to Partick Thistle FC to see the good work that it does. I believe that that sort of work could be replicated at football grounds across Scotland, and could be branded as being part of the Commonwealth games 2014 legacy. I urge the minister to consider that.</p><p>There is much to be welcomed in the draft document, and there are many opportunities. In the time that I have left, I will mention just one. The games present a Scotland-wide opportunity, as Michael Matheson said, but they are also Glasgow's games. I have in the past suggested that a festival of Glasgow should take place before the games. Edinburgh has its festival, but Glasgow is also a festival city. We should have a festival in 2013, to celebrate everything that is good about the Commonwealth and Glasgow. Perhaps a legacy of the games could be a four-yearly festival for Scotland, based in Glasgow.</p><p>I endorse the interim legacy plan paper and very much hope to support the final document when it is published.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14940684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow 2014 Legacy Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Glasgow 2014 is a tremendous opportunity both for the city that I represent and for the whole of Scotland.

However, I have stood up the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to be here to show solidarity with Mr Kelly and the unions and to add my support. I commend James Kelly for bringing the debate to the chamber. It is important that he has done so. It shows why members' business debates exist and how they can bring everyone's attention&#8212;including that of the Scottish Government&#8212;to an issue. I thank him for that.</p><p>For me, the first issue that sticks out as clear as day is that such closures involve not just job losses&#8212;there is a community tragedy when those job losses occur. When I met the unions about the <place-holder colnum=\"16099\"/> downsizing of the Glasgow passport office, they highlighted the fact that not only are the individual employees affected, but the brothers, sisters, mothers, sons, daughters and cousins are affected, too. Without doubt, entire family networks will be wiped out as being economically inactive if the factory closes. That huge impact on communities needs to be borne in mind and that is why I am taking part in today's debate to show solidarity with James Kelly, the unions and the workers.</p><p>Unfortunately, as Bill Aitken pointed out, I doubt that this will be the last time we discuss such issues in the coming months or&#8212;dare I say it&#8212;in the coming years, given the current economic climate. Therefore, it is worth noting that the Local Government and Communities Committee's inquiry into child poverty is starting to give more consideration to not just how we get people off benefits and into work, but how we deal with maximising the income of those who have lost work and are now on benefits, which is clearly happening in the current economic times. In that respect, and without wishing away a single job at Vion, I believe that in the event that jobs go the Scottish Government and UK Government have a joint responsibility to ensure income maximisation for all the families who are affected. That positive action could be taken in both jurisdictions.</p><p>One point that struck me about Iain Gray's question at First Minister's question time today was that, although I disagreed for party-political reasons with many of its sentiments, his question singled out one individual as being the human face of people in troubled economic times. It is important both that we hear those individual stories of the recession and that we take collective action. If we take out the party politics from today's First Minister's question time, I think that we heard general agreement between the First Minister and the official Opposition on the type of collective action that is needed to deal with the job losses in Cambuslang.</p><p>I encourage James Kelly to keep pressing on the issue. He should know that he has my support and that I will work with him constructively. Things can be achieved by working constructively. For example, by doing so I was able to achieve an additional 1,000 apprenticeships for Glasgow City Council as part of a &#163;6 million investment in Glasgow. I very much hope that those 1,000 additional apprenticeships will go not just to people who stay within the Glasgow city area but to people who live in the greater Glasgow area, including James Kelly's constituency. As a list member of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow, I have a shared responsibility to ensure that the people of Cambuslang and Rutherglen prosper and do not suffer job losses, so I am happy to work with James Kelly on that.

Given that under the previous Executive there was at best a stand-still position on tackling student debt&#8212;I am trying to be polite&#8212;and that student debt doubled, it is welcome that the Liberal Democrats and the SNP Government are perhaps moving in the same direction in relation to student support and student debt.</p><p>The Scottish Government has abolished the graduate endowment, lifting &#163;2,300-worth of debt off each student and benefiting about 50,000 students and graduates, and has reintroduced student grants to part-time students with a &#163;38 million investment that will benefit 20,000 students. There is also a 14.6 per cent increase in funds available to tackle student hardship. Those catalysts surely set the agenda for the debate.</p><p>The SNP Government has moved to tackle student hardship and debt, and the Liberal Democrats have joined us. Although I welcome that, I am sure that members will understand that I cannot support the Lib Dem motion. The Scottish Government has moved to deliver the SNP's pledges where possible. With the on-going consultation, we are keen to go further. For many students, their debt is far smaller than it was. <place-holder colnum=\"15724\"/></p><p>While not all of it has been dumped&#8212;not as much as we would like&#8212;we have gone far beyond what any other party promised the electorate at the previous election.</p><p>I have an open mind on the &#163;7,000 minimum income guarantee but, like everything else in life, funding must be identified and allocated and a delivery mechanism must be put in place. I am delighted that a further &#163;30 million has been identified and that the Scottish Government is consulting on how to allocate those funds, but basic arithmetic shows that a &#163;7,000 minimum income guarantee cannot be delivered using &#163;30 million. It also pre-empts the on-going consultation. That is not right, which is why I cannot support the Lib Dem motion.</p><p>That said, at least the Lib Dems are clear about what a minimum income guarantee is. I will tell members what it is not. It is not the Labour amendment. A minimum income guarantee for students is just what it says: a minimum income guarantee. It might be a cocktail of parental contribution, student grant and student loan, but, once implemented, it should be available to all students. Helping the poorest students is, of course, a positive act and is why the graduate endowment has been dumped, why parental contribution has been taken into account and why student hardship grants have been increased. However, a minimum income guarantee by definition gives all students a minimum income. If we give some students a minimum income and not others, we will not help the poorest students who will be left. The bar must be put at the same level for a minimum income guarantee.</p><p>Labour's proposal is simply an oxymoron. In fact, after nearly two years in the chamber, I am beginning to feel that the Labour Party is an oxymoron.

I send my best wishes to Jackie and her family.</p><p>My part in the passage of the Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill has been both formal and personal. I will return to the personal aspect a little later. My formal role was as a member of the Local Government and Communities Committee, which was the lead committee for the bill&#8212;we have already heard from other members of the committee today&#8212;and as a speaker in the stage 1 debate. We hope that the bill will be passed into law following today's stage 3 debate.</p><p>Both in the Local Government and Communities Committee&#8212;which is known for robust exchanges at times&#8212;and in the debates in the chamber, we saw Parliament at its best, in our coming together across party divisions and providing effective and positive scrutiny. That is something that the new Parliament was established to do when it was reconvened in 1999, and I believe that today's passage of the bill into law is a part of achieving that. Looking back at the <em>Official Report</em> of stage 1, I am struck again by the amount of consensus on the issue.<place-holder colnum=\"15234\"/></p><p>At stage 1, I discussed the proposed fines for abusing bays and spoke of the light-touch rather than soft-touch enforcement by Asda stores and, hence, the 93 per cent approval rating from its customers. I wholeheartedly agree with Patricia Ferguson's comments on the Asda store in Maryhill. I, too, have visited that store&#8212;a remarkable job has been done there.</p><p>At stage 1, I also spoke of the need for routine enforcement in high streets throughout Scotland to ensure that there is equal access for people with special mobility needs. The aim of the enforcement measures in the bill is not just to levy fines but to achieve equality. Fines are needed as a tool, but let us not forget that the principle is not about charging motorists but about changing attitudes to achieve equality. The charge is merely a tool to be used to that end.</p><p>I said that I wanted to touch on a personal aspect in relation to the bill. My father is a blue badge holder and in the past couple of years his mobility has gone from bad to worse, quite frankly. Although he used to get out quite often using the blue badge, he now gets out maybe once or twice a month. His experience is that, if he cannot find a space when he goes to a store to go about his personal business, he has to park further away. He can use his walking stick to get into the store and spend five or 10 minutes there before returning to his car and his house, but people do not see the invisible side of such mobility issues. When someone sees a blue-badge holder going about their business, they might question whether that person needs a blue badge, but they do not see the person in pain the next day, and perhaps in bed, because they have pushed themselves to do more than they are physically capable of doing. If the bill is passed today, my father and others like him will benefit.</p><p>Let us hope that the bill will change attitudes and banish ignorance. I consistently hear about cases&#8212;we have heard examples today&#8212;in which someone has used a disabled persons parking bay when they have just popped into the shop for a pint of milk or a newspaper, or are visiting a neighbour for a short while. At the same time, it could be my father or someone like him who is popping in for a pint of milk, to pay a bill, or to visit a relative. Blue badge holders do not want to be prisoners in their houses, but having a Motability car and the blue-badge scheme could make them prisoners in their cars if they cannot get out. We must take that on board. I hope that, as well as the publicity campaign to ensure that people are aware of the new law, there will be a public information campaign to tackle ignorance of the mobility needs of blue badge holders and the unseen side of their disability.<place-holder colnum=\"15235\"/></p><p>Other members have spoken about the costs. I will not go into that in great detail as I mentioned it at stage 1, but I hope that the absurdity of some local authorities' costings will focus their minds and encourage them to give us some real figures. There are serious concerns that some local authorities have inflated the costs to avoid a statutory obligation to enforce bays. If that is the case, they should be ashamed of themselves. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there should be no additional administrative burdens on local authorities as a result of the Bill, because this should be part of their ongoing work under the Disability Equality Duty.\"</p><p>It is clear that that has not always been understood. It is time for local authorities to step up to the plate.</p><p>I finish by quoting the comments that I made at the beginning of my speech in the stage 1 debate, because they sum up how I feel about the bill.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For me, the bill is about ensuring that everyone in Scottish society is treated with the same respect and dignity, no matter who they are. If a person found it more difficult to access or leave their home, to use local facilities, to visit local shops or to go and see their friends simply because of the colour of their skin, their sex or their religion, the Parliament would rightly be outraged.

Members will know that I have talked regularly about my massive concerns about private companies offering sell and rent back products. In doing so, I have echoed the serious concerns of the Office of Fair Trading, which has called on the UK Government to regulate the practice via the Financial Services Authority. The Office of Fair Trading has evidence that companies that offer such products significantly undervalue the houses of struggling home owners at the very time when they must count every penny and are becoming increasingly resigned to having to sell their homes in order to tackle mounting debt. The last thing they need is property cowboys robbing them blind by giving them far too little cash for the property that they are being forced to sell.</p><p>Of course, the one benefit that families that are forced to sell their homes are supposed to derive is that they can stay in the family property. However, we have seen that that is not always the case, because rent level and security of tenure guarantees are often undermined and people are lied to or misled. The OFT found that that has happened. We hope that the UK Government will very soon regulate the shocking black market in repossessions, which results in pain, heartache and injustice for victims. I received a \"wait and see\" reply when I wrote to the UK Government on the matter. It is genuinely still considering regulation, which I expect will be introduced shortly.

Our discussions on that were useful, as I think the Government's discussions with those bodies were. My understanding is that the Government has been clear about ensuring that the assumptions that have been used to calculate HAG levels are accurate. The formula was not an issue; the aim was to ensure that the figures in it were accurate. In working out subsidies, under the old HAG assumptions the figures for rent levels, uncollected rent, inflation levels, housing association reserves and so on were not accurate, which led to the revisions for 2008-09. I am delighted that we have a Scottish Government that has moved quickly and confidently to revise HAG levels for 2009-10 in the light of changed circumstances.

That approach must end, and we must incentivise local authorities to get back in the market to build affordable social housing. I am delighted that 1,000 or so such houses will come online as a result of a &#163;25 million investment.

Good-quality social rented housing should be a first choice, rather than a last resort, for families in Scotland. The high-rise flats of the past, which we are now demolishing, were mistakes. We must ensure that we not only build houses but foster communities. It is in that context that our early years framework can thrive; I hope that it will thrive by engaging families in our communities.</p><p>In addition, we need to challenge, in a constructive fashion, some pre-held conceptions among parents and communities. In doing so, we must raise the capacity and the expectations of families in our most deprived areas. Poverty, poor educational attainment and limited life chances should not be accepted. Our Government and our local authorities must remove the barriers to families leading happy and productive lives, and we must ensure that our most vulnerable families do not view their lot with an air of inevitability. Poverty, ill health, poor educational attainment and antisocial behaviour are not inevitable. They are symptoms of a failure of social policy in Scotland and the UK over many years. In our new Scotland, we must rectify such failings and must do so together, as a Parliament. Whenever possible, we must try our best not to be partisan just for the sake of it. I must hold my hands up and admit that that is a failing from which I sometimes suffer.</p>", "hdate": "2009-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14684715", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Early Years Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I let the Presiding Officer know before the start of the debate that I would not be here for the opening speeches.

The new framework is a testament to the way in which the previous Scottish Executive passed on to the new Scottish Government progress in relation to curriculum development and the qualifications framework. The previous Scottish Executive commissioned the OECD report, which many people regard as a springboard for the Scottish Government's proposed reforms that we are debating today. There is, therefore, continuity within the debate.</p><p>In general, I support the proposed reforms and commend the Scottish Government for its approach. I will raise a few matters that particularly interest me. First, I will comment on the proposed reform of standard grade qualifications. For many, the two-year standard grade courses are too long. Courses that could be short, snappy and exciting can become a two-year drag, so many teachers will welcome the idea of a one-year course that is split into a number of internally assessed units followed by external certification. Motivating students can be a challenge at the best of times, and it can be difficult for teachers to sustain a two-year focus. I therefore welcome the recognition that the current mainstay of S4 assessment at levels 3 to 5 should change and the fact that the reform will lead to focused one-year courses. The merger with intermediate qualifications will achieve a most desirable outcome for education by decluttering the landscape&#8212;that is a most overused term, but it will be achieved in this case.</p><p>Many people frown upon the foundation examination at standard grade. Some say that it is external certification just for the sake of it and that, <place-holder colnum=\"13709\"/> by using course work and internal assessment from the two years, teachers can ably assess whether a student has achieved the required standard. Teachers can ably assess students at standard grade as being of a sufficient standard to merit accreditation at level 3 or, in this case, foundation. In many ways, that makes access 3 a better option for many students and easier for teachers.</p><p>However, although I believe that access 3 has far more benefits, the foundation exam has certain other benefits that I hope will not be lost. The fact, for example, that it is external can be a strength. Access 3 does not have such an external exam. For some&#8212;though not all&#8212;students at level 3, that kind of exam is an important rite of passage in their educational journey and for many teachers the external exam affirms what they already know about the ability of their students.</p><p>Because many schools operate multilevel teaching, there is a very real prospect of having classrooms in which students at level 3 are studying themes similar to those being studied by students taking the new level 4 and 5 qualifications. However, the fact that there is no external exam at the end of the year could lead to problems in motivating students at level 3 and in how they view the validity and status of their own certification. The prospect of exams is the only way in which many teachers can motivate some students, and taking that away might lead to apathy and, in some cases, challenging behaviour.</p><p>I am not saying that students should have to sit an external examination to achieve level 3; however, offering the option of an external examination would give added value to the access 3 qualification and prepare students who wished to move into S5. It would certainly be a new target for students who did not sit&#8212;or, indeed, did not pass&#8212;the external examination. Students who passed the external exam could progress to the new level 4 qualification, if that were deemed appropriate.</p><p>Meaningful progression is important for all learners in education. Although many students will quite rightly want to pursue so-called less academic courses after S4, others will want to persevere with the learning that they enjoy. Offering the option of an external examination for level 3 would provide that kind of progression and I believe that learners at that level deserve such an opportunity.</p><p>I welcome the proposals to introduce science and language baccalaureates at S6 and note that the cluster award approach mirrors that which is taken in the higher still qualifications framework. I am pleased that the baccalaureates will give students an added incentive to push themselves in these areas and that, in particular, they will help to <place-holder colnum=\"13710\"/> motivate S6 students into viewing the year not as a slack year before university but as a chance to push themselves the extra mile.</p><p>However, the introduction of the baccalaureate might have an unintended consequence. As David McLetchie has pointed out, for a number of years now the social sciences have been squeezed in secondary schools. Many students skip social sciences in S5, preferring to take them in S6, while other students who did not take history or modern studies in S4 try to crash their higher in S6. Without a social science baccalaureate in S6, the hand of subjects such as history and modern studies might be weakened further when students come to choose their subjects, and I welcome the cabinet secretary's assurance that she will seriously consider extending the baccalaureate system. However, any such move must be examined and monitored closely.</p><p>I welcome the provision of an extra year to bring in our new qualifications framework. Financial resources are an important issue, of course, and I believe that they will be provided. Politicians will always argue over money, figures and so on, but the biggest resource&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14551236", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Qualifications"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is important that we get our new national qualifications framework right, so I welcome the Scottish Government's extensive consultation on the matter.

If a person found it more difficult to access or leave their home, to use local facilities, to visit local shops or to go and see their friends simply because of the colour of their skin, their sex or their religion, the Parliament would rightly be outraged. We should not stand for it. It should be no different for people with mobility issues, and the bill addresses equality of access for those in our society who are disabled. For that reason, I will support the Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill later this afternoon. I commend Jackie Baillie for the bill.</p><p>My comments are based on my experience as a member of the Local Government and Communities Committee, which took evidence on Jackie Baillie's bill. On the cost of the obligations that will be placed on local authorities should the bill be passed, the financial memorandum says that &#163;1.7 million is required to implement designation orders on existing disabled bays throughout Scotland. However, as we have heard, Glasgow City Council estimates that around &#163;2 million will be required in set-up costs alone, with &#163;2.1 million required to repaint its 4,500 advisory bays. I am not sure where Glasgow City Council is getting its paint from, but the figure suggests that it does not exactly drive the best deal for my constituents and hard-pressed council tax payers. Perhaps the paint is purchased from the home decoration department of Harrods&#8212;along with some gold-handled paint-brushes&#8212;or perhaps the costs have simply been inflated. John Wilson made some pointed remarks about that, with which I associate myself.</p><p>If the bill is to progress, it is vital that we get some more robust figures from local authorities, so that the obligations that are placed on them can be properly costed and planned for. As is noted in the committee's report, Euan Page of the Equality and Human Rights Commission stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there should be no additional administrative burdens on local authorities as a result of the Bill, because this should be part of their ongoing work under the Disability Equality Duty.\"</p><p>If authorities have not been doing that work, why not? If legislation is needed, it is because it is time for legislation.</p><p>On enforcement, I too will mention Asda&#8212;we have heard a few people mention Asda today; I promise that none of us is sponsored by it. It gave <place-holder colnum=\"12765\"/> us evidence on how it enforces disabled parking bays in its car parks. Asda works with Town and City Parking and adopts a light-touch approach to enforcement, as we heard from my committee convener, Duncan McNeil. It is important to note that, for Asda, light touch does not mean soft touch. With a small team of wardens moving between stores, basing themselves where they believe the biggest problems are, Asda has achieved a dramatic effect in freeing up disabled spaces, as we have heard. For Asda, a light touch means changing the attitudes of customers, rather than unduly charging them. By asking drivers to move on, Asda has changed attitudes without alienating its customers. Where necessary, it also issues fines.</p><p>After Asda gave evidence to the committee, I took the opportunity to meet Asda and Town and City Parking at one of Asda's Glasgow stores. I saw a system that was operating very well. In the first 10 months of 2008, Asda fined a total of 185 motorists among its five Glasgow stores. That model may be a template for the owners of other private car parks in responding to the new obligations that the bill will place on local authorities to contact the owners of private car parks with a view to enforcing disabled bays.</p><p>On on-street parking and enforcement, it is important to ensure that people know that the bill will not mean that there is a police officer or warden lurking around every corner. However, it should be easier to enforce the legislation in town centres and on high streets, if that is appropriate, given the likelihood that police officers and wardens will be present anyway. When the legislation is abused, I expect it to be routinely enforced and fines levied.</p><p>The situation is more difficult in remote and rural areas. It is also unrealistic to expect there to be a warden or a police officer lurking around every corner if a bay is abused on housing estates and schemes throughout Scotland. Therefore, it is important that the general thrust of the legislation is about not only access and equality for disabled individuals but changing people's attitudes and behaviour.</p><p>We need more idea of the guidance that will be given to those who will enforce the disabled parking scheme. For example, in local communities, might a sensible way ahead be for a community warden to chap at the door of someone who parks in a disabled bay, to warn them that they could be fined in future, rather than levying a fine there and then? We must ensure that light-touch enforcement is used when that is appropriate and that firm enforcement is used when that is appropriate. We must get the balance right.<place-holder colnum=\"12766\"/></p><p>I would like to hear more about what guidance will be issued but, all in all, I am happy to agree to the general principles of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271268", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For me, the bill is about ensuring that everyone in Scottish society is treated with the same respect and dignity, no matter who they are.

I have spoken on the topic before, and I have fully endorsed the Scottish Government and Scottish local authorities' joint commitment to introduce payments to kinship carers of looked-after children on a par with the payments to foster carers. I acknowledge that \"looked after\" has a legal definition and that other kinship carers will not qualify. I am glad that the Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities acknowledge that and are considering a variety of other ways to provide the support that such carers need.</p><p>There has been a giant stride forward for the 2,000 or so kinship carers of looked-after children, 500 to 600 of whom are in Glasgow, the area that I represent. I must say, however, that many of them will not fully believe that there has been such a stride forward until they see hard cash in their bank accounts. I will return to that point later. It is certainly true of the kinship carers in Glasgow, including the kinship care group in north Glasgow, which I have met several times, and the national kinship care network that was established recently. However, we are building up trust with kinship carers.</p><p>Given the years of inaction and delay from politicians, it is little wonder that expectations are high and that impatience exists. I hope that those expectations will be met before too long. It is only right that support is provided because, in the role of corporate parent, local authorities would otherwise have to place many children with foster parents or in residential care. It is widely acknowledged that, where kinship care is possible, it is far more beneficial for the child, the wider family and society as a whole.</p><p>I realise that, when we reach the point at which a kinship care arrangement is necessary, something might already have gone wrong. GIRFEC is about identifying problems and providing support way before kinship care arrangements are necessary.

Initially, I found the situation <place-holder colnum=\"10482\"/> disappointing. The local authority was not ready to deliver. It was unprepared and there was a dispute about funding the kinship care payments commitment. As many members know, the Scottish Government gave &#163;4 million to provide a range of services for kinship carers, including money for training and a national information and advice service for kinship and foster carers through Citizens Advice Scotland. I am sure that we all welcome that. However, the figure was seized upon not just by the administration of Glasgow City Council but by some Labour politicians in the Parliament, who wrongly claimed that the commitment to kinship care payments was not being delivered. That is not the case. The &#163;4 million figure was wrongly used as a headline figure for paying for delivery of the commitment. To clarify, in a joint statement, the Scottish Government and COSLA said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Government and COSLA have agreed that sufficient resources have been included within the total financial settlement for local authorities to meet the commitment.\"</p><p>The money exists and it should be used for the intended purpose.</p><p>Rather than use kinship care as a political football, I asked for a meeting with Steven Purcell to discuss the matter. At the meeting, I and Councillor Phil Greene&#8212;the SNP council group spokesperson on kinship care&#8212;had constructive talks with Steven Purcell about delivery. The result was that a sub-group was convened to prepare for delivery. I hope that kinship carers will benefit soon.</p><p>Glasgow City Council could have moved much more quickly to deliver for kinship carers in the city. Payments could and should have started by now. However, rather than stand on the sidelines and grumble about it, which would not have achieved anything, I tried to be constructive and proactive in my approach. I ask all members who have an interest in kinship care to do likewise. They should contact their local authorities and have constructive discussions with them about achieving delivery.</p><p>There are wider issues in relation to supporting kinship carers. Scottish ministers are trying to discuss with United Kingdom ministers the fact that the complexity of the UK benefits system has an impact on kinship carers. The issues of child benefit and income maximisation for kinship carers need to be worked through. I hope that UK ministers will appreciate the approach that Scotland is taking on kinship care and work constructively with us. Again, that is something that all politicians in the Parliament can try to support.</p><p>The kinship carers whom I have met provide a vital service for the children they care for, their <place-holder colnum=\"10483\"/> families, the wider community and society in general. They deserve gratitude, respect and dignity, and we are moving in the right direction in that regard.</p><p>Earlier, I described developments in kinship care as a giant stride forward. I expect some local authorities to deliver very soon. As I have said, I believe that local authorities have received funding to do so.</p><p>I do not know whether members have seen the film \"Jerry Maguire\"; if not, my next reference will be lost on them.

The matter is reserved, but the debate should not give rise to a turf war about which matters should and should not be reserved. When jobs in Scotland are under threat, every member of the Parliament has a duty, a right and a responsibility to stand up for those jobs. We are clear about that. During Pauline McNeill's speech, I tried to put on the public record the fact that there can be no assurances about front-of-office jobs at the Glasgow passport office&#8212;it is wrong to say that there can be. I will return to that issue. It is absolutely right that we must deal with the facts&#8212;it is not scaremongering to talk about the facts.</p><p>I want to talk about the human cost of the proposals. More than 100 workers will be affected. Because of the close-knit nature of the IPS, many of those workers could be husbands and wives or fathers and daughters. This is not the first time that their entire lives have been thrown into turmoil because of UK Government reforms, as many of them were transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions during previous reforms. We should always bear in mind the human and social cost of the proposals.</p><p>Unions often get a bad name because they are not constructive, positive or optimistic when reforms are suggested. We must give credit where it is due. The PCS has considered not only the Glasgow passport office, but the entire UK infrastructure of passport offices. The union has made an incredibly worthwhile submission, arguing that if there is to be reform of the offices, we should consider everything in the round and not single out Scotland. Credit must be given to the PCS for that. It is clear that the workers and the union have been progressive, positive and optimistic, for which I commend them. I hope that every job survives and that the reforms are thwarted.</p><p>The IPS has been completely irrational about the entire process. There are seven passport offices in the UK, but the IPS has decided that there should be three, for reasons to do with ID cards. Did the service consider the seven passport offices in the round and think about which to keep and which to ditch? No&#8212;it singled out Scotland's passport office and said that it is going. That is what the IPS has decided. It will go from seven offices down to six and worry about the other three offices later. Scotland's passport office is under <place-holder colnum=\"10079\"/> deep threat. That is not scaremongering; it is a fact.</p><p>Some members are the lamest defenders of Scotland's jobs that I have heard in an awful long time. They must be stronger than they have been this afternoon. If a juggler has one of their arms cut off and somebody throws six balls at them and asks them to juggle, trust me, they will not be very good. The suggestion is not for a death by 1,000 cuts; it is for a death by two cuts&#8212;seven offices down to six, and then six down to three. Scotland will be out next time round in 2010 unless we resist the proposals. However, let us not be parochial. There is solidarity among all passport offices in the UK. Scotland needs a national passport service&#8212;it is a vital piece of Scottish infrastructure.</p><p>The Conservative member talked about scaremongering. Some people have told scaremongering stories about an independent Scotland. I remember the stories that people in an independent Scotland would need a passport to visit their granny in Blackpool. Under the IPS reforms, people will not even be able to get a passport in Scotland, never mind use one to go down to England. The proposals are ridiculous. The passport office is a piece of Scottish infrastructure that must stay in Scotland. I will finish with a final anecdote about Scotland. The Proclaimers had a great idea when they said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I would walk 500 miles\".</p><p>I thought that they were talking about unrequited love; I did not realise that it meant a 500-mile walk to England to get a passport.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13755354", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Passport Office"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will need a pair of sunglasses by the time that I have finished my speech, because the sun is shining straight into my eyes and blinding me.

Like other members, I have read the Mazars report, which was commissioned by the Glasgow and west of Scotland forum of housing associations. It makes compelling reading, and raises serious doubts about how GHA has arrived at its figures on the valuation of housing for second-stage transfer.</p><p>As members have said, GHA was always supposed to be a transitional organisation&#8212;a stepping stone to community ownership by local housing associations. However, the Mazars report points to GHA unfairly pricing community-based housing associations out of taking control of the very housing stock that stock transfer was supposed to give them in the first place. The price that housing associations pay for GHA stock is supposed to be underpinned by the principle of financial neutrality. That is to say, no tenant should be worse off as a result of any second-stage transfer&#8212;a principle that I am sure we all support and the Mazars report accepts.</p><p>Mazars identified a weakness in GHA's valuation process. GHA estimates that it needs to keep certain central financial reserves for its 70,000 houses. However, it estimates that it needs the same amount for managing 50,000 houses, 40,000 houses and 20,000 houses; indeed, if it had only one house, it would keep the same central reserves. Mazars considered GHA's finances and identified a series of GHA central <place-holder colnum=\"8396\"/> costs that one might reasonably assume would be reduced if it managed less stock. However, that is not the case, because GHA uses a highly questionable approach to housing stock transfer known as first and only. In other words, if only one housing association went to transfer, the reduction in costs would, at best, be marginal. The problem for GHA is that although there are 39 known business cases, totalling more than 20,000 units&#8212;or 38 per cent&#8212;of GHA stock, it does not anticipate any costs savings, except at the margins.</p><p>DTZ, GHA's independent valuers, valued the stock proposed for transfer at &#163;46.1 million, yet GHA intends to charge almost &#163;300 million. Taken with the flawed first and only methodology employed by GHA, the Mazars study points not to a gap in funds that are needed to achieve second-stage transfer but to a potential artificially created black hole which, if costs were disaggregated appropriately, could easily be plugged. For example, GHA has not disaggregated &#163;163 million for employee costs and support services. According to GHA's logic, even with 27,000 fewer units, those central costs remain undiminished&#8212;not one less computer operator, not one less telephonist or legal adviser, and not even one less cleaner in GHA's shiny offices in the Trongate in Glasgow city centre.</p><p>Even &#163;9 million that was set aside for tenant participation has not been disaggregated, despite there potentially being tens of thousands fewer tenants. I say to GHA that &#163;9 million is a lot of glossy leaflets through the door of the poor last tenant who remains with GHA come second-stage transfer.

According to Mazars, at the end of a 30-year period, the planned cash reserve per GHA <place-holder colnum=\"8397\"/> household is &#163;550. If 20,000 households go to SST, the financial reserve would increase to &#163;763 per unit, despite there being 40 per cent less stock. That is not financial neutrality; it is a massive cash windfall for GHA at the expense of those of its tenants who democratically decide to transfer.</p><p>An onlooker might say that GHA has come up with a charge to housing associations for SST that suits GHA, which casts it in the light of being an unwilling seller. GHA would claim that its charges are set fairly and independently, but housing associations have commissioned a weighty independent study that cannot just be brushed away. Indeed, the Mazars report's authors are the auditors of Audit Scotland. Mazars claims that the charges for SST are unfair. We have on the one side GHA and on the other the housing associations. GHA needs to respond in a meaningful way to the Mazars study. I welcome the Government's amendment, which offers to facilitate discussions and mediation between GHA and housing associations, and to commit to ensuring that the Mazars study is subject to open, transparent and independent scrutiny. The same should apply to GHA's calculations in relation to SST.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the Scottish Housing Regulator will consider the issue.

I welcome the Scottish Government's positive response to that scrutiny. A vital aspect of the bill that came up at committee and which I am pleased that the Government has taken seriously is the idea of the legacy of the games. I will be making a submission to that consultation, along with others, I hope.</p><p>I want to explore two aspects of the legacy: first, the idea of how the sporting legacy can interact with a social legacy; and, secondly, the creation of a legacy for Glasgow and Scotland that will live on.</p><p>The sporting legacy is not just about getting a clutch of medals in 2014, although we all want that to happen. Rather, it is about building on a raised awareness of sport in general and the inspiration that will be taken from cheering on our sporting heroes on their home turf. I hope that that leads to our young sportsmen and sportswomen getting an extra lift and to the seeds being sown for more sporting success, and that it encourages those who do a bit of sport and exercise to do even more.</p><p>Far more important, however, is the need to reach out to those who do little or no exercise. All too often, they can be on the fringes of society, in some of our most deprived schemes and housing estates. Getting youngsters from such backgrounds to participate is our real challenge and would be a true legacy. A clutch of gold medals might go almost unnoticed in some communities or might seem to be of another world. We must ensure that the games are real to all our communities in Glasgow and Scotland. It will take community projects, youth workers, sports <place-holder colnum=\"8074\"/> coaches, local facilities and long-term funding if we are properly to engage with people who appear uninvolved in or excluded from the process and the celebration of 2014. That presents us with a challenge and an opportunity.</p><p>Operation reclaim, an initiative that is run by the police in Glasgow, is an example of the sort of opportunity that I am talking about. The initiative, which involves people in participating in local sports in order to reclaim our streets, gives troubled youngsters in our communities a chance to be involved in sporting activities. It has resulted in a 37 per cent reduction in crime in the areas in which it runs and has led to young people becoming healthier. The initiative has received money as a result of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which I welcome.</p><p>Ending violence and territorialism and impacting on grim health statistics in one fell swoop is a challenge for our nation, and operation reclaim is a perfect model on which to build a legacy for Glasgow and Scotland following the Commonwealth games. Sporting projects can be used as a springboard for social progress. The Commonwealth games give us a once-in-a generation opportunity. Legacy funding must use sport as a catalyst for tackling serious social issues.</p><p>There is massive scope for inclusion. For example, with regard to volunteering, we should mobilise and involve Glasgow's grey power&#8212;the generations of Glaswegians who have contributed most to giving Glasgow its friendly reputation and image. We should also ensure that there are apprenticeships to fill the skills gap and give youngsters who need job a leg up. That would be a real legacy of the Commonwealth games.</p><p>I will use my remaining time to suggest another legacy: a festival of Glasgow. Glasgow is a city that is known for festivals, and its artistic credentials precede it. The panoply of world-class festivals that complement the dozens of local f&#234;tes and galas give a flavour of what Glasgow is all about. However, I think that we should go for a biggie. Can those individual events use the games to work towards a common, world-class arts festival and carnival that would draw in all Glasgow's communities? Celtic Connections might want to feature the links that it has within the Commonwealth. The Aye Write! festival might want to have a poetry section that celebrates the poetry of Inuits, Maoris and other indigenous Commonwealth peoples. The possibilities are endless.</p><p>We should have such a festival of Glasgow the year before the Commonwealth games, in 2013, as a lead-in to the games. I can just see a parade of floats winding its way to Glasgow green in the sun. The diverse nature of Glasgow's communities <place-holder colnum=\"8075\"/> can be reflected in any festival and the social benefit that the arts can provide for Glasgow will be immense, if they can touch those in our most marginalised and excluded communities.</p><p>If the festival is successful, why not have one every four years, and use that to build a special relationship with whichever country is holding the Commonwealth games?</p><p>I am excited at the thought of the games coming to Glasgow, and at the thought of the world seeing Glasgow in its best light. I am also very much looking forward to the party.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403311", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by expressing my appreciation for all those who helped to secure the Commonwealth games for Glasgow and Scotland and all those who have been involved in the scrutiny of the bill.

It is pretending that the Parliament has not already taken a view, that all is rosy with the council tax and that the Scottish public support the council tax. Such pretence and self-delusion will not help my constituents in Glasgow or the people of the rest of Scotland.</p><p>In Glasgow, the council tax has increased by almost 51 per cent&#8212;by &#163;408&#8212;since new Labour swept to power in the UK. It is hardly any wonder that 88 per cent of Scottish people favour taxation for local services based on income over the council tax.</p><p>Citizens Advice Scotland is equally keen to see the end of the council tax. In 2005, it called on the previous, Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"examine fully alternative means of local government taxation, and introduce a fairer and more cost effective system as soon as possible.\"</p><p>I am delighted that, free from the shackles of the partnership agreement with the backward-looking Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats can now play their part in answering the call of Citizens Advice Scotland, along with the SNP Government.</p><p>Labour is determined to persevere with the council tax. I will highlight three problems with the council tax that would be solved by the introduction of a local income tax based on the ability to pay.</p><p>The first problem is that we all know that the council tax discriminates against Scotland's pensioners and low-paid workers, because it takes no account of their ability to pay. A constituent of mine in Glasgow might have worked all their life to earn a modest salary and then find themselves retired and struggling on a fixed income. Labour does not seem to care about that. Is its advice to those pensioners that they should pay up or sell up? The SNP will treat our pensioners with a lot more respect than the Labour Party will. That is why, under a local income tax, the average pensioner couple will be &#163;717 better off per year.</p><p>The second problem is that at some point Labour will have to face up to the desperate need for a revaluation of Scottish properties if it wants the council tax to have a future. Labour put off the pain of a property revaluation when it was in <place-holder colnum=\"7640\"/> power, but it cannot possibly believe that in 2008 a property-based council tax should be predicated on the house prices of 1991. A Labour revaluation would be bad news: it would force an estimated 750,000 Scottish households to pay more. With a local income tax, the need for such a revaluation would disappear completely.</p><p>The third problem is the potential unknown. Thousands of houses in Glasgow alone, and many more throughout Scotland, have been banded too high. I have discovered a number of such properties in Glasgow, and in conjunction with SNP councillors I have managed to get them brought down to the correct banding. That means that the householder, quite rightly, gets refunded previous overpayments, which often date back several years. It also means that there is a direct loss of revenue to local authorities, which, quite rightly, have to make good those overpayments from their funds. A local income tax will prevent future injustices to home owners on that front and prevent local authorities being exposed to such financial liabilities because of inaccurate bandings.</p><p>The Scottish Government wishes to take forward a scheme of progressive local taxation based on the ability to pay. The Labour Party has no answer and no way of reforming the council tax. I would like to hear in its spokesperson's summing up what its alternative is.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402101", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Income Tax"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No thank you.

All parties in the Parliament should warmly welcome that.</p><p>It is crucial that the Parliament respects the concordat and local authorities' decisions to freeze council tax, in the knowledge that by doing so they will gain extra revenue, which Pat Watters of COSLA estimated to be the equivalent of a 3.4 per cent uplift in revenue that will not cost council tax payers a penny. With that, hard-pressed council tax payers will experience a real-terms cut in their council tax, rather than the average 62 per cent increase since 1997.

I was in the Old Fruitmarket in Glasgow when the result of the bidding process was beamed back live from Sri Lanka. The atmosphere on that day was electric during the build-up to the announcement, and it was euphoric after the successful bid was announced. The sight of Wendy Alexander, Nicola Sturgeon and Annabel Goldie on stage dancing with one another was truly something to behold. Such unity and shared joy among political parties was a pleasure to watch&#8212;although perhaps the dancing abilities of those whom I have mentioned were not. It was a joy to watch the many schoolchildren and young athletes who made up the bulk of the crowd that day as they celebrated the announcement. Their energy and enthusiasm were inspirational. I know from subsequent news coverage that such scenes were repeated in schools and sports centres throughout Glasgow.</p><p>On the way home that afternoon, my friends&#8212;one of whom possessed the largest saltire that I have ever seen&#8212;and I met a group of Glasgow workmen, who were aware that an announcement was to be made that afternoon. They asked us what the result was, although given the grins on our faces, they may have had a sneaking suspicion that the announcement had been positive. When they heard the good news, one of them asked my friend whether they could borrow the flag. I use the word \"borrow\" advisedly; in Glasgow, it means that you ain't getting back what has been borrowed. The flag was readily handed over. Thirty seconds later, it found its way to the top of a scaffolded building that the workmen had been working on&#8212;I also use the word \"working\" advisedly. A number of proud and patriotic chants and songs from our new-found friends followed in the dulcet tones that only Glasgow workies are capable of. After a while, the owner of the flag <place-holder colnum=\"6350\"/> thought that it would be best not to try to get it back, and we went on our way.</p><p>I tell that story because it is connected to the idea of providing a legacy. If we could bottle the feel-good factor that was shown in the Old Fruitmarket, schools and sports centres and by the workmen whom we met that day, it would go a long way towards raising the expectations and aspirations of many of the most vulnerable and impoverished communities in Glasgow.

A co-ordinated approach to the build-up of the 2014 Commonwealth games and beyond is essential.

We have a wonderful opportunity.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee noted in its stage 1 report that sportscotland told the Finance Committee that \"significant investment\" will be required if we want a legacy.

A general principle of the bill is the development of grass-roots sport. I support that principle, but what do we mean by it? We must develop grass-roots sport in Scotland on the back of the games, but we must remember that the Commonwealth games will be not just Scotland's but Glasgow's games. I hope that consideration will be given to the host city, which has the worst levels of poverty and deprivation in Scotland, health statistics that would make some developing nations blush and the most serious youth disorder and gang problems in the UK. If ever there was a place on which we needed to focus &#163;150 million of investment, it is Glasgow, and grass-roots sporting facilities in the city. I hope that the vast bulk of money raised from lottery funding will go directly to Glasgow. Good projects already exist in the city, which aim to break down gang culture and territorial boundaries and attempt to divert youngsters, via sport, from disorder. Such projects must be encouraged, funded and expanded.</p><p>If we want to bottle enthusiasm and civic pride in the Commonwealth games and their legacy, it will cost money.

As others have said, it is important to acknowledge that much in the review is to be welcomed. By and large, our education system compares favourably with many of our international competitors. For example, we are above average in the three literacies of science, maths and reading; we have one of the lowest levels of poorly performing pupils in OECD countries; and the gap between the top quartile and the bottom quartile is below the OECD average. However, the PISA findings show that our international position has slipped compared with 2003.</p><p>Figures also show that the number of our students who end up in the not in education, employment or training category remains stubbornly and worryingly high: the 1999 figure was 37,000 and the 2005 figure was 36,000. I do not use those facts to criticise the previous Executive; I am simply stating the present position. We have to go forward together in the education debate in order to achieve success for our schools and our schoolchildren.</p><p>It is in that context that we view the OECD review and its concerns about inequality in educational attainment. I note the point that the report makes about that:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Little of the variation in student achievement in Scotland is associated with the ways in which schools differ. Most of it is connected with how children differ ... children from poorer homes are more likely to underachieve, disengage from schoolwork, leave school earlier than others, and&#8212;if they continue&#8212;study at lower academic levels and record lower pass rates.\"</p><p>Rhona Brankin touched on a similar section of the report.<place-holder colnum=\"5073\"/></p><p>The previous Scottish Executive attempted to progress the situation, and we must examine the schools of ambition scheme in that context. After a bit of research, I found that Springburn academy is working to incentivise parents from deprived areas to take a real interest in the progress of their children. The situation is not all bleak, but we have to improve and move forward together.</p><p>The Government's early years strategy will assist in tackling social inequalities in education, and it is right that it should be monitored in years to come. Indeed, it will take a number of years to see the benefits that our youngest children will derive from the strategy and carry through to their secondary education experience.</p><p>We must also ensure that pupils who are at secondary school today have the best possible education experience in terms of educational attainment and the quality of the learning experience. With the curriculum for excellence and the very interesting recommendations in the OECD report, we could be entering a period of great change in secondary schools in the next few years.</p><p>I turn to one of the OECD recommendations&#8212;that standard grade examinations should be phased out as part of the new three-to-18 curriculum. There is much reasoning behind that recommendation, and much of it might even be logical, but ditching standard grades could be the proverbial throwing the baby out with the bath water, although I remain open-minded.</p><p>When standard grades were introduced, there was a belief that students of all abilities could study across a full range of subjects and be assessed at an appropriate level. The concept was meaningful certification for all. Many students and teachers might now believe that a system in which the majority of students study, say, eight standard grades across a range of subjects and courses that seem to some to drag on for two years is in need of review and reform. However, I am not sure about scrapping standard grades completely.</p><p>The OECD contrasts what could be achieved by abolishing standard grades with how it interprets the current system. It refers to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a reformed programme of studies that is seen as purposeful and meaningful and can aim at high accomplishment in a range of areas or a transcript of examination results which shows how little academic learning has occurred\".</p><p>The OECD says that that is the choice to be made.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries: \"Reviews of National Policies for Education: Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this afternoon's debate on the findings of the OECD review of the quality and equity of schooling in Scotland.

It may be true that some students are sitting in low standard grade sets waiting for two years to get the grade 6 that they and perhaps their teachers anticipated anyway. On entering S3, the standard grades route may not be the most appropriate for many. Greater flexibility and a variety of provision are needed in S3 and S4 to ensure that many students are not left disillusioned and simply marking time. That is what much of the new skills for work programme is about. I recognise the need for change.</p><p>However, there is another story to tell. Although many students might not be high achievers or at the top end of the academic spectrum, they still enjoy the subjects that they study. Indeed, they might gain satisfaction from accessing the curriculum at an appropriate level for their needs and they might not want that opportunity to be taken away.</p><p>In that context, I note Liz Smith's comment that if standard grades are to be replaced they should be replaced in S4 with intermediate 2 qualifications, which are at credit level and beyond. I am incredibly wary of such a move, as it could mean that summative assessment at the end of S4 would be for only the very highest achievers in academic subjects. I am open-minded on the matter, but I want to ensure that elements of choice and diversity in the current system are not lost. The OECD's apparent suggestion that summative assessment should be removed requires closer examination. However, I agree that it might be possible to merge the higher still S5 and S6 curriculum with what is happening at standard grade.</p><p>As I have said, I remain open-minded about the future of certification and the curriculum in S3 and S4, and I am interested in hearing other members' comments on the issue.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries: \"Reviews of National Policies for Education: Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the member for that intervention.

That group in the north of Glasgow organised an election hustings and invited kinship carers from across Scotland to attend, ask questions and listen. At the hustings, I pledged to campaign to give kinship carers of looked-after children parity of esteem and financial support with foster carers. I returned to the north <place-holder colnum=\"4101\"/> Glasgow kinship care group after my election and gave the same pledge.</p><p>It is with great pride and humility&#8212;something that I will return to shortly&#8212;that today I can say that the promise looks like it will be fulfilled. It will be fulfilled not just by our new Scottish National Party Government&#8212;this is not about party politics&#8212;but by local authorities throughout Scotland, whose representative body, COSLA, and 32 leaders have supported the local government concordat, which says that the allowances to kinship carers of looked-after children should be equivalent to those for foster carers.</p><p>The concordat is also central to the fostering and kinship care strategy that was launched yesterday. It is a team effort by our nation's Government and local government that will vastly improve the lives of many of our most vulnerable families. As we have heard, the Fostering Network has recommended an allowance of between &#163;119 and &#163;198 per week, and that figure has been accepted by the Government as a minimum level of support. That money can make a dramatic difference to the lives of carers and the young people who are cared for.</p><p>I approach the debate with great humility because I have seen the invaluable service that kinship carers provide, not just to children and their relatives, but to society in general, often in financially and emotionally tough circumstances. Many kinship carers struggle to cope, but they do. They cope because they have no choice but to cope. While I was talking to one kinship carer in Possilpark, I asked whether she would benefit from additional respite care. She said that her grandchild was not ready to be left alone with anyone bar her, but that if they could occasionally have just a short break&#8212;a day here and a day there&#8212;that would be something. At the moment, they cannot afford that. I hope that that kinship care family are closer to being able to have such an activity as part of their lives. It is something that most people would take completely for granted as a normal and happy part of the childhood experience.</p><p>Children 1<sup>st</sup> has welcomed the fostering and kinship care strategy. It has called it a bold new move and, in particular, praised family group conferencing, which is a model that it has championed and excelled at. There is a clear acknowledgement that the best place for any child is a loving and caring home with their parents, and that if that is not possible a kinship carer close at hand is the next best option, with fostering following that.</p><p>The most expensive and poorest outcome for children, parents, families and society is when children unnecessarily end up as looked-after <place-holder colnum=\"4102\"/> children in a residential setting. That is clear in terms of educational attainment, life expectancy, a drastic reduction in quality of life and the likelihood of progressing to the criminal justice system, developing drug and alcohol abuse problems or developing mental health problems.</p><p>It not only makes good sense but is socially just to provide kinship carers with financial support similar to that for foster carers. After all, kinship carers know their kids best and are best placed to deal with challenging behaviour and to provide the required emotional support. Moreover, they save the state money and improve the life chances and quality of life of looked-after children.</p><p>I hope that the strategy and the parity of esteem, financial support and dignity that it affords the kinship carers of looked-after children will not only improve the life experience of those children and families but prevent more children from unnecessarily entering a residential setting under local authority care.</p><p>I commend the motion to the chamber.

However, I will focus on an issue that cuts across all those groups, which is regional or area-specific equality, or the correlation of poverty with where someone lives.</p><p>The motion talks about equality of opportunity and a fairer Scotland. Hard work and talent should be rewarded within society, but unless the conditions are right, many hard-working, talented people will struggle to flourish. Why is it that only 22 per cent of Glasgow's youngsters in fourth year received five credit level qualifications or equivalent this summer, while the figure was 57 per cent in East Renfrewshire?

Dundee and West Dunbartonshire deserve special mention. Youngsters in those areas are no less intelligent than those in East Renfrewshire. I suggest that while the reasons for poorer performance may be complex, when the complexities are stripped away, poverty becomes central to equalities in terms of regional equality and educational attainment. Education is at the core of equality of opportunity, and it is a crucial stepping stone to finding a route out of poverty. For many youngsters, such stepping stones do not exist or are more difficult to navigate.

At today's meeting of the Local Government and Communities Committee, the Minister for Communities and Sport talked about how that would work.</p><p>We are talking about regional inequality by location for educational attainment, but of course when talking about equality in education, it would be remiss not to mention visually impaired students, who struggle to get the necessary software and laptops, both at school and at home <place-holder colnum=\"3835\"/> for homework; learning-disabled students who do not always get the correct support; or students for whom English is a second language, who struggle to get the necessary support.</p><p>As well as equality of opportunity, there is equality of condition. It is a central human rights issue that not only should everyone have a real opportunity to improve their lot, but that we all have a right to have certain basic needs met. For instance, to what extent can different groups&#8212;or, in my example, people from different locations&#8212;get access to a decent standard of housing, be able to walk down the street safely, or have basic leisure and recreational amenities close at hand? The poverty statistics for parts of Glasgow make woeful reading. One fifth of Scotland's poverty is based in Glasgow, and Glasgow has a disproportionate share of Scotland's poorest areas. With that comes environmental poverty. Something that brought home to me the qualitative aspect of equality was the fact that, while in Eastwood 23.1 per cent of the population stays within 500m of a derelict site, in Springburn the figure is 86.3 per cent. Those figures clearly demonstrate the poverty of environment as well as of income.</p><p>I should mention a couple of other groups in connection with equality of condition. We must ensure access to decent local amenities. It is my understanding that, in the whole of Glasgow, there is only one hoist suitable for adults with physical disabilities who want to access a swimming pool. That is surely unacceptable. It is also unacceptable that, if two people who are in a same-sex relationship walk down the street in parts of the city, they are more likely to be attacked simply because they are in such a relationship. Those situations are unacceptable as part of the human experience.</p><p>It would be wrong not to mention life expectancy when discussing regional equality. The projected life expectancy of babies born in Glasgow in 2004 to 2006 is 73.7 years, whereas the national average is 77.2. That leaves Glasgow 32<sup>nd</sup> out of 32 local authorities. International comparisons do not look good either, particularly for those who live in Glasgow's Calton area, where male life expectancy is an appalling 53.9 years, compared with more than 70 years in the Gaza strip. If Mike Rumbles had hung around to talk about inequalities with regard to male life expectancy in Scotland, that would perhaps have been constructive.</p><p>I was going to talk in a genuinely non-partisan way about the new Government's early years strategy, which I believe to be based on an equalities agenda. However, I do not have time for that, so I will point out one aspect of it of which I am proud: the extension of allowances for foster <place-holder colnum=\"3836\"/> parents to the kinship carers of looked-after children. That is incredibly important in equality terms.</p><p>I have been talking about putting poverty at the centre of the equalities agenda because poverty bites. It does not distinguish colour, creed, sexual orientation or disability, it just bites. There are regional inequalities in where it bites, and we must accept that. Many people face not only inferior life chances because of where they live, but stigma because they come from a certain part of the country or even a certain housing scheme. I am sure that there is room in equality and diversity week for them and for the Equality and Human Rights Commission to acknowledge the scale of poverty and inequality.</p><p>With that in mind, it gives me great pleasure to support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392994", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Equality and Diversity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There has to be some form of correlation there.

I have not had the chance to dip into it yet, but I promise him that I will look at it.</p><p>Later this evening, many MSPs will attend the politician of the year awards dinner. No doubt good food will be eaten and a few drinks will be had. One or two humorous stories may even emerge over the few days following the dinner. We all know how stories work: they are often funnier and more entertaining when exaggeration and embellishment are added to provide spice and seasoning. In Scotland, the cement that binds a good story is often the special ingredient of alcohol. I am always surprised by how many times grown adults exaggerate and embellish their behaviour&#8212;even their mild misdemeanours. It seems to make us far more windswept and interesting. The cement that binds stories is often alcohol&#8212;not only when they are created, but when they are retold.</p><p>\"How many drinks did you have last night?\" That has been a common question over the years, but how many people give an honest answer? The answer is often, \"I can't remember, but it was a fair few,\" or, \"A bucketload.\" Why do people exaggerate? Why, according to the statistics, do teenagers in particular exaggerate? That is a vexed question, the answer to which likely involves a heady cultural mix, the ingredients of which would no doubt keep many a sociologist in employment for many a year. However, it appears that not only do we exaggerate our own stories, we believe other people's exaggerations.<place-holder colnum=\"3552\"/></p><p>Kenny Gibson's story of his student days struck me. I had a similar good friend who liked going out and participating in the drinking of alcohol. After two or three drinks that was him&#8212;that was his limit&#8212;but he would never say no to a pint of lager, and he would have to be seen to drink it. However, he did not drink it, and I knew that he did not drink it. He felt that, socially, for the company, he had to pretend that he was partaking of alcohol along with everyone else.</p><p>It is of little surprise that when adults cannot have a mature, honest and responsible relationship with alcohol, our perceptions of the social norms of alcohol consumption become hazy, to say the least. It is also of little surprise that when it comes to the drug of choice for many, people overestimate their peers' consumption. Worryingly, the gap between the real social norm for consumption and the perceived social norm may fuel some to drink more heavily. After all, we all, in our own way&#8212;even the most rebellious among us&#8212;like to be part of the social norm and to be accepted by our peers. Surely we should tackle the social misconceptions that may lead to increased consumption of drugs and alcohol.</p><p>I am sure that there are a number of drug and alcohol awareness initiatives in educational institutions. However, any tailoring of them&#8212;or, if need be, the provision of stand-alone projects that deal openly and honestly with our relationship with drugs and alcohol, including challenging misperceptions with regard to peer groups&#8212;would surely be worth while.

The debate so far has been useful in shining a light on many of the problems that car parking charges are causing.</p><p>I am keen to speak in today's debate and must declare an interest. My partner, Janet, is a nurse and has been affected by car parking charges at both Glasgow royal infirmary and Glasgow's Western infirmary, where she currently works. Although the motion mentions Stobhill specifically, this is a health-board-wide issue. That is why I support the independent review that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon, has commissioned and which is due to report shortly.</p><p>I can speak with confidence and direct experience of the anger and frustrations that car parking charges are causing to staff across Glasgow, and which they will cause to staff at Stobhill. When charges were first introduced at the royal infirmary, nurses were charged &#163;25 per month. By the time Janet applied for a permit there, the cost was &#163;47 and the current charge is &#163;57. That car park is owned by Impregilo Parking (Glasgow) Ltd and managed by a company called APCOA Parking (UK) Ltd, which is a private profit-making organisation. Profit is not the motive that Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board should have when it considers whether there should be car parking charges at its hospitals.</p><p>My partner currently works at the Western infirmary, where&#8212;as at Stobhill&#8212;charges are determined by Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. If staff at those hospitals cannot qualify for a permit&#8212;which costs up to &#163;40 per month&#8212;they must pay &#163;7 a day. Not everyone will qualify for a permit. Staff will be allocated permits on the basis of their need to access a car to do their jobs and of the frequency of journeys that they need to make. Staff who do not receive a permit will not be able to park in staff car parks. I have direct experience of the issue, as some of my partner's colleagues applied for permits, just as staff at Stobhill will have to. Although a member of staff from Bearsden received a permit, members of staff from Wishaw and Linlithgow did not. There is no <place-holder colnum=\"3400\"/> coherence, organisation, structure or fairness in how charges are applied and in who gets permits.</p><p>Janet is quite fortunate, because she stays in Maryhill and can get to the Western infirmary relatively easily. However, I do not want her to walk down to it at 7 in the morning in inclement weather, and would prefer her to take her car. Doing that daily for a month would cost her &#163;91 in car parking charges.</p><p>I am mindful of the fact that in April 2004 the previous Executive issued guidelines on car parking charges and that at the time there was no opposition in principle to such charges. However, the Executive did put some criteria in place. In 2005, Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board committed itself to a strategy of car parking charges, but only to deal with specific problems. From what Paul Martin and others have said today, it is evident that many of those specific problems do not exist at Stobhill. Why is Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board applying a one-size-fits-all approach to car parking charges in the entire health board area?</p><p>It is clear that the pending review must consider not just the general principles behind car parking charges but how they affect patients, staff, carers and visitors at all hospitals. It must certainly deal with the real concerns that patients, staff, carers and visitors have at Stobhill.

Organised crime is a blight on our society and it affects the lives of far too many families and communities. In that respect, however, Glasgow Milton has suffered more than most. When organised crime takes a grip in the community, it does so for a number of reasons. The most obvious one is that there are people who are prepared to make money off the back of the misery and suffering of others. It also requires a base from which to operate and flourish, and a community that is compliant&#8212;not through choice, but through fear.</p><p>In Glasgow Milton, there are said to be two main crime families of not just local, but city-wide, significance. They may even have national significance as part of an organised criminal network. One of the alleged crime families is the Lyons family. I mention them because a Mr Edward Lyons Snr was the co-ordinator of the Chirnsyde community initiative, which is mentioned in the motion, for a number of years. In fact, he was the co-ordinator until recently, when events last December brought his position there abruptly to an end.</p><p>The centre remains closed. Many locals believe that it was closed not before time and that the tragic events that led to its closure could have been far worse. When locals made repeated complaints over many years about alleged criminal activities taking place in and around the Chirnsyde centre and about the centre being used as a base for organised crime, they felt that their complaints <place-holder colnum=\"2552\"/> fell on deaf ears. Seeming inaction by Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde Police only added to their frustrations and fears that the council would not look at the Disclosure Scotland checks that were carried out to assess the suitability of staff who worked there&#8212;the council said that that was a matter for the Chirnsyde community initiative itself.</p><p>Locals knew that Edward Lyons Snr and other members of his family had been charged with the murder of Thomas McDonnell in the vicinity of the Chirnsyde community initiative and that the verdict was left at not proven amid fears of witness intimidation.</p><p>The fact that the centre has received more than &#163;1 million of taxpayers' money in the past 10 years has only added insult to injury. The council pulled the centre's funding only after a tragic triple shooting last December at a garage on Balmore Road owned by David Lyons, the brother of Edward Lyons Snr, where Michael Lyons, nephew of Edward Lyons Snr, was shot dead and Stephen Lyons, the son of Edward Lyons Snr, and one other were seriously injured.</p><p>Court proceedings with regard to that shocking crime are pending and, for obvious reasons, I will be very careful what I say.</p><p>The MOT garage was beside the local primary school and, had the hit on the garage been carried out earlier, or had it gone badly wrong, who knows how many innocent young people or parents arriving to collect their children might have been caught up in the mayhem and carnage.</p><p>Given that the Chirnsyde initiative was another known location at which to find the Lyons family, it is only by the grace of God&#8212;or on the toss of a coin&#8212;that the initiative was not the location for the attack, which would have put staff and youngsters at risk of being caught up in terror. That is precisely why locals called not just for the closure of the Chirnsyde initiative but for its safe reopening. Nevertheless, the police, the council&#8212;and Bridget McConnell, the council's director of culture and leisure&#8212;acted too late to prevent such an escalation in gang violence, of which the local community activists had repeatedly warned. Being proven correct does not give those activists pleasure, but their belief that they were brushed off by officials makes them angry.</p><p>Organised crime needs a base in which to flourish. Chirnsyde might have been such a base, run at taxpayers' expense, but there is a fear that another base might remain.</p><p>In February 2006, there was a council by-election in Milton. During that campaign, when I acted as the election agent for Councillor McAllister, as he became, I received a number of anonymous survey returns that raised concerns <place-holder colnum=\"2553\"/> about the Chirnsyde initiative. One respondent said that they would not send a rabid dog to the centre. Billy McAllister won the by-election on a ticket to clean up Milton. Following December's triple shooting, he received death threats for his attempts to do so.</p><p>Locals have put their lives on the line and their families in danger by taking a stand. I could give a number of examples of incidents that have left local campaigners terrified, but I do not want to bring back bad memories. Many are still living with the legacy of standing up against organised crime in their area. Indeed, on Saturday night, one local campaigner's car window was broken and his car was set on fire.</p><p>The courageous and tireless work that community campaigners such as John McLean, Alex O'Kane and Charlie Traynor have carried out to draw attention to the possible inappropriate use of the Chirnsyde initiative must not go unnoticed; nor must the support of newspapers such as the <em>Sunday Mail</em>, which championed their campaign despite attempts to discredit them. I have evidence that the Glasgow City Council media affairs team described the campaigners as \"bampots\" to the press. Given events, I wonder who the bampots are now.</p><p>Elected representatives and the police must also be more willing to take communities' concerns forward when they are made known to them. If that happens, some good can come from the pain and suffering that people have endured. That also becomes my challenge as a new MSP.</p><p>The debate is about thanking people and looking forward. In that spirit, I urge Glasgow City Council to achieve the safe reopening of the newly named Ashgill community centre as soon as possible and to ensure that the pillars of the community that stood up against organised crime are involved in that. We also have to build up trust with the local police, which will take time. I pay tribute to operation reclaim, an initiative in the area based at St Augustine's playing fields that ran for six weeks over the summer. In particular, I pay tribute to the work of police constable Harry Faulds, who is trying his hardest to see the scheme extended. The area desperately needs such initiatives, and I call on Strathclyde Police and Glasgow City Council to look in the round about how to take the community forward.</p><p>In closing, I return to my two initial comments. First, in Milton there is a community that is managing to rise up and beat the fear that holds many communities back in tackling organised crime. Criminals use fear to keep communities across Scotland under siege and on their knees. We should all be truly thankful that there are people such as John McLean, Alex O'Kane and Charlie Traynor around.<place-holder colnum=\"2554\"/></p><p>Secondly, and finally, I hope that our new Government will look imaginatively, creatively and determinedly at ways to disrupt and destroy organised crime networks throughout Scotland that work nationally and internationally. I hope that it will also give much-needed support to communities not just in Glasgow, but throughout Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389745", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chirnsyde Community Initiative"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I begin my speech, I must note that parliamentary privilege in this chamber is nowhere near as comprehensive as it is in Westminster, so we must all be careful about what we say.

Let us get to the truth; let us have the public inquiry.</p><p>At the time of the disaster, the Health and Safety Executive had only 68 inspectors to police 81,000 workplaces, so an inquiry should investigate the relationship between the Health and Safety Executive inspection regime and workplace health and safety regimes, and the effectiveness&#8212;or otherwise&#8212;of that relationship. A public inquiry is not just about justice for the victims and their families; it is, as I have previously said, about learning the lessons, and ensuring that such an incident cannot and will not happen again.</p><p>On justice, I am aware that compensation, whether in cash or any other form, cannot remove or make up for loss and suffering. However, the imposition of two &#163;200,000 fines as the total sum of the consequences for ICL Plastics&#8212;for nine workers' lives lost and 40 workers injured&#8212;just does not seem to cut it. I understand the reasons behind the limitations on such fines&#8212;it was noted in the \"The ICL/Stockline Disaster\" report that the cost of fines might even be passed onto workers, who are most endangered by safety offences.</p><p>An alternative&#8212;or an addition&#8212;to fining companies would be to have an equity fine system, which has been developed by lawyers in the United States of America. Such a system would target guilty parties effectively and leave at least some form of positive legacy for victims, their families and affected communities. It would allow courts to order guilty companies to issue a quota of new shares to be administered by a state-controlled compensation fund. My colleague Bill Wilson has lodged a motion on equity fines, which I hope that members will have a look at.<place-holder colnum=\"2058\"/></p><p>However, today's debate is about the call for a public inquiry.

In June, Hugh Henry brought to the Parliament a motion on skills and vocational education that called for 100 skills academies for Scotland.

However, credit must be given to Hugh Henry and Labour for the fact that they were willing to step up to the plate and to advocate their policy&#8212;albeit one that is deeply flawed&#8212;as a party of opposition. On the day of the debate, despite Labour having allies in the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats voted down the Labour motion, which both parties considered would undermine the comprehensive education system. Thank you, Hugh.</p><p>I mention June's debate because back then Labour was willing to let Parliament shine a light on its policies. I admit that, in doing so, it provided a degree of constructive opposition. However, today's motion departs from that model. I genuinely hope that that will not continue, for both Labour's and the Parliament's sake. The Labour motion suggests that the SNP Government has not given education high enough priority, despite the fact that the Government has already acted to remove the financial barriers that existed under <place-holder colnum=\"1694\"/> Labour in the form of the graduate endowment; that we are employing an additional 300 teachers and creating an extra 250 training posts for new teachers; and that significant capital expenditure has been made available to local authorities to enable them to take steps towards meeting the Government's targets for reducing class sizes in P1 to P3. From October, there will be a pilot in which P1 to P3 children in five local authority areas will receive free, nutritious school meals. This week we also launched our skills strategy, which was debated in the chamber only yesterday. Given those and other initiatives, it is laughable and plain daft to say that the Government has not given high enough priority to education.</p><p>By all means let Labour put before the chamber a motion stating that it is against reducing class sizes, that it opposes the abolition of the graduate endowment or that it will not increase the number of teaching professionals in our classrooms&#8212;let it stand or fall by the weight of its arguments.

An analysis of today's Labour Party motion provides us with yet another. Instead of being about the three Rs, the motion is about the three Ws: it is whining, whingeing and wide of the mark. I will explain why. The Government has committed significant sums of money to making early progress on certain key elements of its programme. Those include the &#163;25 million package for early years education, increased nursery hours, 300 new teachers and 250 new student teachers; the &#163;40 million of capital spending that has been made available to local authorities to enable them to meet the class sizes targets; &#163;15 million to fund the abolition of the graduate endowment; &#163;5 million that has been provided for free, nutritious school meals; and &#163;1.5 million to fund the further development of the Crichton campus, whereas the Labour Party would have been happy to preside over its closure.</p><p>I would love Fiona Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, immediately to throw shovels of cash at every project imaginable, but that would be feckless and <place-holder colnum=\"1695\"/> reckless. The Government will not do that, even if Hugh Henry would. I am sure that the cabinet secretary would love to know from John Swinney what slice of the overall funding cake is coming her way. Indeed, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth would love to know how much he will be awarded. However, until the UK Treasury informs the Scottish Government of the final results of the spending review, large, grandiose spending commitments would not be about each portfolio getting a fair share of the cake but would be political pie in the sky.</p><p>I am proud of the Government's commitment to education and of the speedy progress that has already been made. Everyone accepts that there is always a need to lever in more cash, where possible. We agree with Hugh Henry and the Labour Party that we should maximise the financial input into education. However, if the Labour Party, which is now in opposition, joined us in seeking full financial independence and full fiscal powers over our economy, we could increase the overall income of the Parliament and spend it on all our priorities, including education.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13387288", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I know that the extra \u00a39 million that the Government has provided will fund 300 more teachers than we would have had if the Liberal Democrats had still been in government.

I am now coming into contact with individuals who are asylum seekers and can for the first time put a human face to asylum seekers. That is another reason why I wanted to speak in the debate.<place-holder colnum=\"1419\"/></p><p>I met a young man called Abdirahman Mohamed. When he first came to Scotland from Somalia, he was 16 years old. He will not go back to Somalia as his mother is one of the legacy cases. Indeed, he cannot go back to Somalia as he has no home there; another family stays there and he most certainly would not be made welcome if he were to return. He now stays in Sighthill in Glasgow.</p><p>Over the past month or so, Abdi has been telling me about his case. When he came to Scotland as a 16-year-old, the decision had to be made as to whether it was more suitable for him to go to the local secondary school or to a further education college. It was decided that he should go to the local FE college to improve his core English skills, which he did. After that, he had a desire for higher education, so he took an access course at the FE college. Very quickly&#8212;in just under a year&#8212;he got the access equivalent of highers in computing and maths. At that point, he had no route into higher education so, rather than stay idle, he did the maximum amount of highers that an FE college would let him do. The next year, he took two highers and got fantastic grades. This year, he did another two highers and got fantastic grades. He had a thirst to learn, despite the fact that there was no obvious funding access into higher education. Learning was a privilege for him. Until recently, the only option open to him was to find roughly &#163;11,000 a year to fund himself through university as an international student. Of course, the irony of it was that neither he nor his family was even allowed to work.</p><p>There was light at the end of the tunnel for Abdi, and I was delighted to be able to confirm with the Scottish Government and with the University of Glasgow that he will be starting a full-time course at the university at the end of this month. The University of Glasgow has shown discretion in this case. Fees cannot be paid for young asylum seekers in higher education until next year, but the university has shown a fantastic willingness to accept year 1 fees in year 2. That flexibility shows that our academic institutions are willing to give such young people access to higher education. However, I should mention the situation in which Abdi now finds himself. Normally, young students can find a part-time job to fund themselves through university, but that is denied to Abdi, which is a travesty and a tragedy. It is part of the human experience. A further difficulty is that in three or four years' time, Abdi could be a highly skilled graduate who would not be entitled to use the skills that our taxpayers have invested in him to work in Scotland. That would be appalling.</p><p>To me, Abdi is not an asylum seeker but a friend whom I have helped out on a constituency matter. I am keen to have Abdi as an intern, either at the Parliament or at my constituency office. We heard <place-holder colnum=\"1420\"/> stories about whether buying someone a can of Coke and a sandwich counts as payment for work. There are real issues there that we must consider again.

It was replaced by another form of taxation that, on one level, bore an important similarity: when the council tax was introduced, it also took no account of people's ability to pay. That structural flaw in the poll tax <place-holder colnum=\"984\"/> was doppelgangered in the creation of the council tax. The detestation that society felt for the poll tax in the late 1980s and early 1990s still exists for the council tax.</p><p>In my maiden speech in the chamber, during the wealthier and fairer debate, I said that I believed that there was a clear majority in Scotland in favour of scrapping the council tax. We must strive to find such a majority in this chamber too&#8212;a majority that cuts across traditional party lines to serve our people.</p><p>Earlier this year in Aviemore, the UK Lib Dem leader, Ming Campbell, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our principle is simple. People should pay taxes in accordance with their ability to do so. Those who earn less should pay less.\"</p><p>On the SNP benches and in the Government, we agree with those sentiments. I am sure that others will agree too. There will also be others who believe in taking 500,000 pensioners out of the local taxation system and stopping them living in fear of the annual council tax bills that they cannot pay coming through their doors.</p><p>Tackling poverty is high on the political agenda, and rightly so. A number of points have been made recently about how best to define poverty. Definitions have included when a parent cannot afford a bike for a child, or a school trip, or when parents cannot take their children on a family holiday. Different people will put the poverty bar at different levels, but no matter where it is placed, a tax on earned income will ensure that people who earn less will pay less&#8212;not more as happens at the moment. In a fair and just society, that is surely right. That basic principle, put into the form of a local income tax, will benefit not only our pensioners, but nine out of the 10 income decile groups in society&#8212;and the 10<sup>th</sup> group will pay only moderately more.</p><p>Members will remember Michael Howard's belated apology in 2003.

We might have different perspectives on how we can best create wealth for our nation and what constitutes the best way to spend to achieve fairness in society, but we should all warmly welcome the tying together of the ideas of wealth and fairness as a foundation on which to build cross-party consensus.<place-holder colnum=\"213\"/></p><p>I am greatly encouraged by that underpinning of social values and by their going hand in hand with wealth creation. The former First Minister's approach to helping the people of Malawi won praise across the traditional political divide, because we all recognise that wealth creation comes with the responsibility of helping people who have been left behind by society, whether locally, nationally or, in the case of Malawi, globally.</p><p>It was revealed earlier this year that in 2006 more than 1,900 people who were seen in Scottish hospitals were diagnosed with malnutrition. In a modern society that is simply unacceptable. As our society becomes wealthier, such figures must be monitored closely. When necessary, we must use society's wealth to assist in curing society's ills. That is why it is vital that nutritious free school meals should be available to all our children, beginning with the early years in primary school. Their introduction would bring a positive lifestyle change, with consequent massive long-term health benefits. I am proud that our Government is keen to do that.</p><p>In 1979, one in eight children lived in poverty. Today, the figure is one in four, which is a scandal&#8212;that is almost 250,000 children. In total, more than 900,000 people in our nation are living in poverty. Our nation has not only a responsibility to help them but a direct economic self-interest. People in poverty must also be seen as potential wealth creators. They are a massive, untapped, wasted and often alienated resource.</p><p>Education is rightly seen as a route out of poverty for many people. Our new Government's aspiration to extend free child care for three and four-year-olds by 50 per cent, its aspiration to ensure that there are fully qualified nursery teachers in our nurseries and our intention to reduce class sizes dramatically for the early years of primary school will not only provide a positive social platform but put in place the building blocks of future economic prosperity.</p><p>There are many other examples of how we can make society fairer. The policy of abolishing the unfair council tax and introducing a local income tax that actually takes account of people's ability to pay has substantial support in the chamber and, I believe, overwhelming support in our country. I hope that the Parliament will not let society down on that&#8212;and, in particular, that it will not let our pensioners down.</p><p>I welcome our Government's ideas on significantly reducing business rates for small businesses. If implemented, that policy could lead to boards being removed from shop windows throughout Scotland. It could breathe new life into our villages, towns and cities. In Glasgow, which I represent, small businesses will warmly welcome <place-holder colnum=\"214\"/> that move. There, 15,000 small businesses will pay no business rates at all, and another 3,800 will benefit from a significant reduction in rates.</p><p>The results of excluding fairness from wealth creation are clear, nowhere more so than in Glasgow, which suffers from the lowest life expectancy in the UK&#8212;and it is lower than in most parts of Europe. The numbers of economically inactive adults and of young men who are not in employment, education or training are woefully high. In Scotland, 13.9 per cent of people can be described as income deprived; for Glasgow, that figure is almost 25 per cent, or one in four. In my home constituency of Maryhill, 51.4 per cent of children are in families that claim benefits. That is double the national average, which is an absolute outrage.</p><p>Traditional working-class communities in Glasgow feel under threat. Many people see bulldozers on the horizon, with no guarantee that their community will be kept intact. Such unfairness only increases the social alienation that many feel. It is little surprise that antisocial behaviour finds a breeding ground in such circumstances. I give Maryhill in Glasgow, where I stay, a commitment to defend those communities and others throughout the city that need help, rather than being demolished out of existence. They must be treated with respect, which I strongly believe previous Governments categorically failed to do.</p><p>Glasgow has many deep-seated issues that have been present for more than a generation. It should be the engine room of the Scottish economy. A legacy of neglect might have taken its toll, but with appropriate investment from a Government that takes into account its special circumstances, combined with a fresh approach from Glasgow City Council, Glasgow will be able to flourish once more. I hope that that will include a successful bid to host the Commonwealth games in 2014.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383718", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wealthier and Fairer"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The idea of a wealthier and fairer nation is surely one on which all of us can agree.
