The 27th of January has become the international day of commemoration of the victims of the Holocaust. Now in its 14th year, Holocaust memorial day gives us all an opportunity to pause and reflect on those atrocities, with commemoration events taking place in communities in Scotland and across the United Kingdom.</p><p>In East Renfrewshire tonight, the council is holding its annual Holocaust memorial day event at St Ninian&#8217;s high school. I represent East Renfrewshire as part of my West Scotland region, and it is also where I live with my family. Holocaust memorial day is always an important event in the area as it is home to Scotland&#8217;s largest Jewish community. This year, two senior pupils from each of East Renfrewshire&#8217;s seven secondary schools have been invited to talk about their experiences of the lessons from Auschwitz initiative. As members know, the lessons from Auschwitz project is organised by the Holocaust Educational Trust, with the support of the Scottish Government, to enable Scotland&#8217;s young people to gain first-hand knowledge of the horrors of the Holocaust.</p><p>I regret that I am not able to be at St Ninian&#8217;s this evening to hear the personal reflections of those young people on how their trip to Auschwitz has affected each of them. It is crucial that young people are given the chance to learn about the atrocities of the Holocaust to help them to understand the importance of standing up to senseless hatred and discrimination. Having spoken with some of the pupils who have taken part in the lessons from Auschwitz initiative, it is clear to me that it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that will never be forgotten. It provides a vital link between the events of the past and the education of future generations.</p><p>Last week, we heard from William Seaborne and Ruth Laird, two pupils from Queen Anne high school in Dunfermline, who delivered time for reflection and told us about their experiences of visiting the former concentration camp. Ruth and William both provided moving accounts of the range of emotions that they felt whilst seeing at first hand the setting for one of the darkest moments in our history. They described it as an eye-opening experience, with the stories of those who lost their lives and those who managed to survive being both haunting and inspiring in equal measure.</p><p>We have come a long way in the 69 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, although subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur show that we must be resolute in our determination to challenge prejudice, hatred and intolerance.</p><p>The greatest weapon to protect against discrimination is education, which is why the work that the Holocaust Educational Trust does to preserve the lessons of the past is so valuable.</p><p>The theme of Holocaust memorial day this year is journeys. It offers a timely opportunity to pay tribute to the Holocaust survivors who managed to escape persecution and make new lives in Scotland. The date 9 November 2013 marked the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht, which is known as the night of broken glass, when the Nazis launched a series of co-ordinated attacks on Jewish people throughout Germany and Austria. Thousands of Jewish homes, businesses and places of worship were ransacked and burned to the ground.</p><p>Kristallnacht resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Jewish people during the attacks, and a further 30,000 Jews were forced from their homes and incarcerated at concentration camps. Many people consider it to mark the beginning of the Holocaust, and it led to the Kindertransport humanitarian rescue mission, which helped to save thousands of Jewish children from violent persecution.</p><p>It is estimated that more than 10,000 Jewish refugee children were separated from their parents and came to the UK as part of the Kindertransport initiative. Approximately 400 of those children came to live in Scotland. We can only imagine what it must have felt like for those children to say goodbye to their parents as they left for places unknown. It helped them to escape almost certain death, but many never saw their parents again.</p><p>A number of Kindertransport refugees stayed in Scotland to start families and make new lives for themselves, which greatly enriched our communities in the post-war years. When he was just 15, in 1939, Henry Wuga came to Scotland as a Kindertransport refugee from Nuremberg in Germany. I had the honour of hearing him speak during an event that the Association of Jewish Refugees held last year at Garnethill synagogue to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht.</p><p>Now aged 89, Mr Wuga lives in East Renfrewshire with his wife Ingrid, who is also a survivor of the Holocaust. They met each other at a refugee club on Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow and they have lived in Scotland ever since arriving here. They are now proud grandparents with two daughters and four grandsons. Mr Wuga was awarded an MBE for his work to help ex-servicemen and women who have lost limbs or the use of their limbs in the line of duty. He and his wife are also well known locally for their dedication to voluntary work and charitable causes over the years.</p><p>Mr Wuga regularly visits schools to talk to pupils about Kindertransport and the traumatic and dangerous experiences of being a Jewish child living in Nazi Germany. His testimony is compelling and offers an invaluable insight into life as a Kindertransport refugee coming to Scotland during the second world war.</p><p>Most of the Kindertransport survivors are in their late 80s and 90s, and the sad fact is that this will be the last major anniversary that many can take part in. I have spoken previously about gathering the voices&#8212;an archive project that records the first-hand accounts of men and women who fled Nazi persecution to come to Scotland. Mr Wuga&#8217;s story is one of many that are available through the project, which ensures that his testimony and that of many others are preserved for future generations. I am proud to support the gathering the voices project and the work that it is doing to help to ensure that Holocaust survivors are remembered not just as victims but as people who were welcomed to our country and who contributed to making Scotland a better place to live in.</p><p>The atrocities of the Holocaust resulted in a loss of life that is almost too difficult to comprehend. It is right that we refuse to allow those deaths to be in vain. Holocaust memorial day allows us to remember those who lost their lives, but it also gives us the opportunity to celebrate those who bravely resisted the Nazis and survived.</p><p>It is a reminder that we all have a responsibility to stand up to prejudice, hatred and intolerance in our society. It is a reminder of the importance of doing all that we can to ensure that the lessons of the Holocaust are never forgotten.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holocaust Memorial Day 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yesterday marked the 69th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazi concentration camp that has come to symbolise the brutal state-sponsored persecution and mass murder of over 6 million Jewish men, women and children.

It was an absolutely shocking speech and that is a shocking ideology that I thought we had got rid of.</p><p>Like other members on the SNP benches, I welcome the First Minister&#8217;s announcement that we will introduce free school meals for all children in P1 to P3&#8212;that is a fantastic announcement. I particularly welcome the expansion of childcare for two-year-olds from August 2014 and the further expansion that is planned for August 2015. That is a great step forward that I am sure will be welcomed by families throughout the country.</p><p>It is a well-known fact that the first years of a child&#8217;s life are vital to its overall development and that the ground that is lost in the first five years of life is never fully made up. Dr Herczog from the National Institute of Family and Social Policy in Hungary, who is also the president of Eurochild, has said:</p><p>&#8220;Research shows that in the long run, it is beneficial for children to spend time with well-trained professionals and with other children&#8221;.</p><p>She went on to say that access to childcare facilities is even more important for children from vulnerable and socially excluded households.</p><p>&#8220;Investing in the first three years of a child&#8217;s life has significant long-term benefits in terms of their overall life perspective, engagement in criminal activity, substance abuse and their own parenting skills&#8221;.</p><p>The effective pre-school and primary education study, which was led by Professor Edward Melhuish at the University of London, found that pre-school attendance improved all children&#8217;s cognitive development and aspects of social behaviour such as independence, concentration and co-operation. Childcare is good for children and the more deprived that a child is, the more vital childcare is to their life chances. Childcare is also good for parents, particularly mothers, and for families. With affordable childcare, a mother can go out to work and the extra income can be vital in lifting an entire family out of poverty. The extra taxes that are then paid by the family benefit the economy and the country; therefore, affordable, high-quality childcare is good for us all. There are no losers&#8212;everyone benefits from free childcare.</p><p>In Norway, every child between the ages of one and six has a statutory right to a kindergarten place up to a maximum cost of &#163;200 a month, and nearly 75 per cent of adult women work. Norway is ranked number 1 in the world for productivity measured by GDP per total hours worked according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Dr Krashinsky, an economist at the University of Toronto, has stated that</p><p>&#8220;Norway&#8217;s high productivity flows directly out of their progressive social policies&#8221;.</p><p>He said:</p><p>&#8220;What we found was a general pay-off of about two dollars of benefits for every dollar spent on subsidized child care, and those were very conservative numbers.&#8221;</p><p>Sadly, the UK lags behind some other countries in the number of mothers with children under the age of six who work. In Denmark, as we have heard, the figure is 79 per cent, whereas in the UK only around 59 per cent of mothers work. More than 70 per cent of those mothers who do not have childcare provision say that it is the cost of childcare that is holding them back. When we think that parents in Scotland spend 27 per cent of their household income on childcare, we realise what a barrier that is for many parents. In comparison, the OECD average spend on childcare is only around 12 per cent of household income.</p><p>However, the Scottish Government has made progress. In 2007, three and four-year-olds in Scotland were entitled to 412.5 hours of free nursery education per annum. Today, three and four-year-olds are entitled to 475 hours of provision per annum and, of course, in August of this year, that will rise to 600 hours per annum for three and four-year-olds and the most vulnerable two-year-olds. Today&#8217;s announcement will expand that provision to 15 per cent of two-year-olds this year and to 27 per cent in 2015. That represents real progress under an SNP Government.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22825309", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The speech that we have just heard was based on the Victorian premise of the undeserving poor and a belief that the only way to motivate the poor in this country is to make them poorer.

Women&#8217;s Aid, sadly, is still vital. However, some things have changed over the past 40 years. Who would now argue that women should be paid less than men for equal work? Women obtained 59 per cent of first degrees issued by higher education institutions in Scotland in 2011-12. Society&#8217;s attitude to women has changed and women have more education and greater financial and legal power than they have ever had. That is excellent news but, sadly, there is still a long way to go and we must not become complacent&#8212;not in the face of 60,000 incidents of domestic abuse.</p><p>We have made progress but, worryingly, the rights of women to equal treatment and autonomy in the public sphere are being challenged. Last month, Universities UK, an organisation that provides guidance and support to universities and higher education institutions, including 15 such institutions in Scotland, issued guidance in which it indicated that it may be acceptable at an event to segregate the audience by gender if the speaker has requested that and his religious views are that women should sit separately from men at public events.</p><p>Apparently, according to Universities UK, if the room is separated on a left to right, rather than a front to back basis, there is no discrimination as men and women are being treated equally. That may be legal&#8212;I am not convinced&#8212;but it is not right or moral. It allows, for example, a speaker, if he so wishes, to address his remarks and take questions from only one section of the audience.</p><p>The guidance states:</p><p>&#8220;Ultimately, if imposing an unsegregated seating area in addition to the segregated areas contravenes the genuinely held religious beliefs of the group hosting the event, or those of the speaker, the institution should be mindful to ensure that the freedom of speech of the religious group or speaker is not curtailed unlawfully.&#8221;</p><p>I am pleased to say that, under political and public pressure, Universities UK has now withdrawn that guidance and is in talks about a revision.</p><p>There is no balance of rights between the right to speak, which is not affected by where people sit in an audience, and the right of women to decide where they seat themselves at a public event. People are entitled to their beliefs and opinions, but they are not entitled to impose their views and restrict choices for women in the public sphere as a result of their beliefs.</p><p>The more we treat women as different, the less empowered they are. Violence against women is at the end of a continuum of abuse of power by men over women and disrespect for women&#8217;s rights. Putting the beliefs of a speaker at an event at a university over the rights of the female students and staff at the university is the soft end of that continuum. Members should make no mistake: this is all about men asserting their power over women, and we must oppose it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22813683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Domestic violence, 80 per cent of which has a male perpetrator and a female victim, and attacks on women by strangers have one common factor: the power that some men choose to wield over women.

It is appropriate that the Scottish Government has chosen to launch the consultation on the draft strategy at a time when we are also preparing for the Glasgow Commonwealth games and, of course, the Ryder cup in 2014. The Commonwealth games in particular will be a stimulus for various economic, sporting and health initiatives, but it is important to ensure that those initiatives leave lasting benefits after the exciting events of next year have ended.</p><p>As the Government motion correctly points out, the potential benefits of sport are far reaching and any current investment in youth sport will manifest itself in many positive outcomes in years to come, particularly, I hope, for the most disadvantaged in our society.</p><p>As other members have mentioned, and as I am sure that others who have yet to speak will mention, sport has benefits that reach well beyond sport itself: from building the confidence of a young person to developing social skills as part of a team, through to improved health and embedding exercise habits that will, we hope, last a lifetime. However, the Government&#8217;s long-term objective of creating a healthier nation will not be achieved without the active participation of young Scots.</p><p>Like others, I therefore very much welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to create a young people&#8217;s sport panel, which consists of 16 14 to 25-year-olds, to ensure that young people are engaged and at the forefront of maximising the impact of sport in their communities. It has been a consistent theme of this Government to ensure that young people are empowered, whether at the ballot box or in their community, and I believe that including young people in shaping the future of sport in Scotland ensures the continuation of that policy.</p><p>As a West Scotland MSP, I am delighted to see that my region is well represented in the young people&#8217;s sport panel. Hannah Jolly and Matt McCormick of Bearsden are both members, and Kulbir Singh from Barrhead and Sophie Gibson from Giffnock will also help to increase the profile of sport in their communities. Kulbir&#8212;to pick out one person&#8212;is an example of how the involvement of young people in sport can create wider benefits. A badminton player in his own right, he has also volunteered at national and international sporting events, including the four nations disability badminton tournament and the national badminton championships. He runs a badminton club and is a member of the committee in his local Sikh temple that organises sports days in the community.</p><p>Through Scottish Government initiatives and the enthusiasm of people such as Kulbir, Sophie, Hannah and Matt, who work hard in their communities, Scotland is well armed for the battle against physical inactivity, with 70 per cent of children aged two to 15 now meeting the recommended levels of physical activity. We beat ourselves up in this place about statistics all the time, but frankly we should celebrate the fact that we are making progress in all these areas, including the battle against physical inactivity.</p><p>The 2013 healthy living survey shows that 89 per cent of pupils from first year to fourth year now meet the Government target of two periods of PE per week, which is a considerable improvement since 2004-05. The Scottish Government&#8217;s recent announcement of a further investment of &#163;5.8 million will ensure that we are able to build on the progress that we have made in creating a healthier and more active society. The youth sport strategy is another step forward in the development of sport in Scotland and a number of welcome measures are included in it, such as community sports hubs and ensuring that young people with a disability are fully involved in PE and sports provision.</p><p>It is not a straightforward or easy task to change a nation&#8217;s outlook in terms of sport or healthy physical activity, but I believe that we are on the right path. Next year will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to not only raise the profile of sport in Scotland, but encourage our young people to live more active and healthy lives. It is therefore reassuring to see that the Scottish Government is already well prepared to take advantage of those major events and build on the existing opportunities that young people in Scotland enjoy.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22798494", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Sport Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the launch of the Scottish Government&#8217;s draft strategy on youth sport and the opportunity to take part in today&#8217;s debate.

That discussion demonstrated strong cross-party support for the bill&#8217;s broad aims of effective early intervention and better support for our children and young people. Several members also stressed their commitment to making the bill even stronger and to ensuring that the legislation delivers real improvements in people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>I want today&#8217;s debate to build on those sentiments and aspirations, and for us all to consider how we can improve outcomes for looked-after children and young people in particular. To be blunt, that might not be too difficult. Our inquiry confirmed again that many young people who have been in care have worse education outcomes than other children. Many also have poorer health and are more likely to become homeless or to become involved in the criminal justice system.</p><p>Although the committee is united in its view that further improvement is necessary, it is encouraging that so much activity is under way to improve outcomes for young people. The Minister for Children and Young People will no doubt wish to highlight the various measures that the Scottish Government is taking, as set out in its response to our report. We welcome such measures, but I will use this debate to push the Government for more detail on some of our recommendations. I also hope that the debate will inspire other members and committees to consider their role in improving outcomes.</p><p>However, before I get into the detail of our recommendations, I will provide Parliament with some background on what was a complex and relatively long-running inquiry. Our remit was to consider the decision-making processes that are involved in determining whether a child should be removed from the family home and taken into care. More important is that we also asked whether those processes are delivering the best outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>We took an enormous amount of evidence across a wide range of decision-making processes, including social work, the children&#8217;s hearings system and the child protection system, and I wish to thank everybody who submitted evidence to us. We took evidence about and from children who have been in care, who were looked after at home or who may be at risk of becoming looked after.</p><p>Our remit developed throughout as we continually sought to focus on areas where we considered that the need for improvement was strongest. Although we are debating the committee&#8217;s final report, we also published an interim report to ensure that none of the many concerns that were raised with us were lost.</p><p>In order to frame our debate, I make it clear that nobody who contributed told us that the current system of child protection and welfare should be abolished and that a completely new system should be established instead. That said, there were suggestions for improvement across virtually every area that we looked at. To put it starkly, we consider that current decision-making processes are not always delivering the best outcomes for children and their families. That view was heavily shaped by the children and young people to whom we spoke, many of whom had harrowing stories to tell.</p><p>In Scotland, we talk a lot about putting children and young people at the centre of decision making. However, according to the young people whom we met, we do not always deliver on that promise, which is why we were determined to place the views and real-life experiences of young people right at the heart of our report. When teenagers who have been in care tell elected politicians that they were left too long at home when they should have been taken into care, there is a considerable responsibility on us all to listen and to respond. The problem that those teenagers described is easy to repeat to Parliament, but it is by no means easy to solve. Their concerns are at the heart of highly contentious issues such as the right of the state to intervene in family life, and how professionals make decisions about them.</p><p>Another aim of our inquiry was to encourage a public and media discussion of issues around care. We hear very little about child welfare and protection until something goes wrong, so we wanted to encourage a debate on questions including why some children are taken into care but others are looked after at home, whether general assumptions can ever be made about someone&#8217;s fitness to be a parent, and whether there is consistent decision-making across the country. Those questions can be hugely controversial, sensitive and difficult, but rational public discussion can make them less so.</p><p>I will provide a brief example of how our current approach to children who are at risk of coming into care is of considerable public interest. Without commenting on the merits of that development, I note that earlier decision making is resulting in more children coming into care at a younger age&#8212;something that the Scottish Government considers to be a &#8220;positive development&#8221;. We need to be aware of and to debate such changes, and we need to be alive to how they may impact on society.</p><p>Having provided the background, I will highlight some of our main conclusions and recommendations. I will focus on vision, resources, early interventions and the respective roles of the Scottish Government and local government. Above all, I will focus on outcomes.</p><p>No one could question the amount of activity that is under way to improve the position of looked-after children. Apart from the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, the Scottish Government&#8217;s response mentions a forthcoming care and permanence strategy, efforts to map the processes and bodies that are involved in decision making, a review of statistics on looked-after children, and several other pieces of work. We appreciate the efforts that are being made across the public and third sectors to reform the child protection and welfare systems, and we acknowledge that some improvements will take time to manifest themselves. However, our report highlighted the danger that the sheer volume of on-going work could give the impression that deep-rooted problems are being addressed incrementally. The committee also wanted a reassurance that all the reforms are being co-ordinated, that key findings will be acted upon and that they will result in better outcomes.</p><p>In seeking to improve looked-after children&#8217;s outcomes, we must know their current outcomes and the outcomes that are expected. The minister quite correctly considered that it is too crude to judge success for looked-after children in terms of the number of children who are being taken into care. She called for a</p><p>&#8220;better, more rounded picture of a looked-after child&#8217;s well-being&#8221;</p><p>to gauge whether an intervention has been successful. The Scottish Government&#8217;s response to our report stated that</p><p>&#8220;There are some encouraging signs that outcomes are improving gradually across almost all indicators.&#8221;</p><p>I would welcome further detail from the minister about which outcomes are improving and the ways in which life chances will continue to get better as a result of the current reforms.</p><p>Given the complexity of current decision-making processes, the number of bodies involved and the on-going reforms, our report called on the Scottish Government to establish</p><p>&#8220;a shared vision of what success would look like for looked after children&#8221;,</p><p>and to</p><p>&#8220;ensure that resources and processes are built around that vision&#8221;.</p><p>The Scottish Government has been commendably clear in stating that the policy aim is early permanence, which it considers will help to reduce the number of children on long-term supervision requirements and increase the number of children who find secure legal permanence. I am sure that the minister will expand on that aim in her speech. When she does so, it would be helpful if she could discuss the bigger-picture outcomes that it will deliver. Will we see improved educational attainment and better health and employment prospects, for example?</p><p>I would also welcome an assurance from the minister that the on-going reforms will involve children and young people themselves, because no one can speak with more authority about what improvements are still required.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the issue of resources featured in both our interim and final report. For example, we questioned the Scottish Government on evidence that suggested that decisions about removing children from the family home are affected by availability of appropriate placements. Given changing demographic patterns and the strong policy emphasis on the early years and preventative spending, we also asked for projections of the balance of care; that is, the likely number of children who will require to be taken into care.</p><p>At a time of budgetary pressures, it is critical that we know the level of spending, what it is delivering, and whether that spending is achieving optimal results. We therefore asked the Scottish Government to calculate the total sum of money that all the relevant bodies spend on protecting children, and whether that spend is providing value for money. The minister made clear the difficulties of disentangling spending in that way, but said that the total possible spend on children&#8217;s services is about &#163;2.5&#160;billion.</p><p>In response to our requests on planning and resources, the Scottish Government emphasised its view that an understanding of spending and need is best determined at local level. That said, the Government set out how it supports local authorities to promote strategic commissioning. The minister may wish to expand on that approach in her speech.</p><p>Our report concluded, however, that we still do not know whether public spending on supporting and protecting children is delivering value for money. However, we consider that existing resources&#8212;people, financial and time&#8212;could be used more effectively. For example, several witnesses told us that too many people are involved in the decision-making processes. We also recommended that all the on-going reforms should take value for money fully into account, so we would welcome the minister&#8217;s reassurance on that point.</p><p>I will now highlight a specific aspect of the resources discussion. The Scottish Government&#8217;s focus on early intervention and preventative spending has been widely discussed inside and outside Parliament, and there is broad support for the principles. The Scottish Government considers that although early intervention may lead to an initial rise in children becoming looked after, it can also help to ensure that fewer children are looked after in the longer term. In the light of that trend and the strong emphasis on the financial benefits that are to be derived from early intervention, we asked for an analysis of the likely delivery and financial implications for service providers. I would welcome any further detail that the minister could provide on that.</p><p>In recognition of its leadership role, our recommendations were aimed primarily at the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government&#8217;s response makes clear its role in</p><p>&#8220;holding partners to account towards ensuring that we deliver excellence&#8221;</p><p>and in</p><p>&#8220;helping service providers to set the policy and resource framework&#8221;.</p><p>We are fully aware that improvements to decision making and outcomes will rely heavily on the input of the people who work at local level. However, it would be helpful to have clarity around lines of responsibility and accountability, given that the Scottish Government has a leadership role and local authorities have a delivery role. To illustrate that matter, our report raised concerns about social workers; namely, threats to their post-graduate training and councils&#8217; ability to retain experienced staff on the front line. We were concerned by the Scottish Association of Social Work&#8217;s claim that social work training departments have</p><p>&#8220;disappeared as a result of the cuts that have happened to local government&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;Post-qualification training &#8230; is now disappearing.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 28 May 2013; c 2524-5.]</p><p>Given social workers&#8217; fundamental role in bringing about improvements, we asked for detailed information on the impact of the local government settlement on their post-qualification training and career development. We also asked the Government to confirm the action it would take should the evidence substantiate the claims that have been made. We note the Scottish Government&#8217;s view that matters of social work delivery, training and support are for local authorities; however, it would be helpful if the minister could respond to those claims and that recommendation in her speech.</p><p>Children who have been in care do not simply need to do better at school. They need to enjoy better health, they need more stable and better quality accommodation, and they need to be far less likely to become involved in the criminal justice system. Those are hugely challenging problems, and it is to the credit of Parliament and our wider society that so many people are investing time and effort in trying to do better by some of our most disadvantaged fellow citizens.</p><p>Our inquiry was immensely challenging and, at times, very emotional; it also left the committee with somewhat mixed feelings. We welcome the widespread efforts across government, the public and third sectors to improve decision-making processes and outcomes for children and young people, but the rate of improvement is still too slow, considering the amount of effort and resources that have been committed over a long period.</p><p>As we concluded in our report, too many children have been left for too long in unsuitable home environments, and too few children move quickly enough into stable loving homes and go on to enjoy the same life chances as other children. The Education and Culture Committee will maintain its commitment to those children and young people. We will get updates from the Scottish Government on the outcomes that all the activity that is described in our report is helping to deliver. When we do so, we will speak again to those who are most directly affected by the reforms: the children and young people themselves.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s 10th Report, 2013 (Session 4): Report on decision making on whether to take children into care (SP Paper 386).</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22788788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Children into Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today&#8217;s debate comes soon after the stage 1 debate on the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill.

I cannot cover everything in the time that is available, so I will focus on five areas: children&#8217;s rights; named persons; information sharing; the extension of early learning and childcare; and aftercare for young care leavers.</p><p>Part 1 of the bill relates to the rights of children. Many children&#8217;s organisations supported the full incorporation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into Scots law. They considered that that was the best way to embed children&#8217;s rights into the culture of our society, enhance respect for our children and send a clear message about how we value them.</p><p>Those are laudable outcomes, but the committee was unanimous in its view that the case had not been made for full incorporation of the convention. Our main difficulty was that it was not always clear what practical improvements such a move would bring for children and their families. Our view is that, although the outcomes arising from incorporation are important, it does not necessarily follow that incorporation is the best or the only way in which to achieve them. In addition, the convention is already implemented in Scotland in a number of ways, such as under our obligations in the Scotland Act 1998.</p><p>Although we are not persuaded by the argument for full incorporation, we agree that the duties on the Scottish ministers and public authorities should be strengthened. Ministers must report every three years on what they have done to further the convention, for example. We want the bill to go further, so we have called on ministers to set out their vision on what they will do for each three-year period. We have also asked the Government to explain why it has chosen to require public authorities to report on</p><p>&#8220;what steps they have taken ... to secure better or further effect&#8221;</p><p>of the convention and not to require them to act on those findings.</p><p>The second area that I want to focus on is the introduction of a named person for every child and young person up to the age of 18. I should of course acknowledge that one committee member, Liz Smith, did not agree with the inclusion of that proposal in the bill. However, it was supported by the rest of the committee. The named person proposal forms part of the wider policy of getting it right for every child, or GIRFEC.</p><p>As members will be aware, the proposal to introduce named persons has received considerable comment. Some of the most compelling evidence that we received was from Highland Council, which is seen very much as a trailblazer for GIRFEC. The council told us that the named person role was developed through practice and experience, and that it was based on what families and professionals wanted. The initiative has been fully implemented since 2010 and the results are encouraging. Families like having contact with someone whom they know and who knows the child, and they do not have to deal with bureaucratic systems to get some extra support. Professionals, too, have welcomed the initiative. Teachers, health visitors and midwives feel that the named person role has not changed what they do but has made them feel empowered.</p><p>We also heard evidence from health and teaching professionals that the named person role could lead to a reduction in neglect. According to Highland Council, the introduction of named persons meant that children were more likely to get the help that they need when they need it, and fewer children were referred to the children&#8217;s reporter. However, the committee is mindful that some of that improvement is due in part to the culture of integration and collaborative working across front-line services in Highland.</p><p>As we have said in our report, we want the Scottish Government to give details of the range of support that it will provide to ensure that local authorities and health boards can replicate the successes that have been experienced in Highland, recognising the different circumstances that will prevail in different parts of the country. We also highlighted a number of practical issues that need to be resolved, such as the types of intervention that a named person will be expected to make and how the role will operate during school holidays. We believe that the success of the named person role will depend on the Government&#8217;s ability to work with its local partners to clarify those and other issues.</p><p>The Scottish Government must also be prepared to ensure that health boards, but particularly health visitors, can cope with the demands placed on them. The Finance Committee raised that point with us, and we have asked the Government to explain how capacity issues will be managed to ensure that the bill&#8217;s good intentions can be put in place.</p><p>Linked to the introduction of named persons is the proposal to lower the threshold for sharing information about individual children or young people without consent. The bill will allow professionals to share information where there is &#8220;concern about the wellbeing&#8221; of a child rather than only where, as the current test requires, there is &#8220;risk of significant harm&#8221;. It is crucial that all those who share information are properly trained. Training and guidance must cover all relevant service providers, including the private and third sectors, and must engender a common understanding of what constitutes proportionate, necessary information sharing.</p><p>We also refer in our report to the concerns that were raised by witnesses about the drafting of the information sharing provisions in the bill. For example, Professor Norrie described the provisions as &#8220;contradictory&#8221; and the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office felt that the scope of section 27 was too wide and wanted it to be redrawn. We therefore welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment to look again at the drafting of those important provisions. I know that the Government will carefully consider the comments of the committee and others before we approach stage 2.</p><p>The bill will also extend the number of free hours of pre-school early learning and childcare to which children are entitled from 475 to 600 hours per year. That is indeed a positive step and it reflects the crucial importance of early years intervention in children&#8217;s development. We also very much welcome the plan to introduce increased flexibility in the provision of the new entitlement, which will make it easier for parents to take up employment opportunities. However, we urge the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to work to ensure that flexible arrangements are made available as quickly as possible to enable families to take advantage of the new provision.</p><p>Finally, I want to touch on the important proposals to extend support for young care leavers up to the age of 26. Currently, local authorities must provide support up to the age of 18 and have discretion for those up to the age of 21. As we heard during our previous inquiries, young care leavers are particularly vulnerable. We must do all that we can to ensure that they receive adequate and appropriate support so that they can enjoy exactly the same outcomes in life that many of us take for granted. We recognise the difficulty of that and we recognise that the transition from being in care to independent living can often be an extremely difficult time in a young person&#8217;s life. We therefore support the bill&#8217;s proposals but invite the Government to respond to the three questions that are asked in paragraph 178 of our report. The minister referred to that earlier in her comments about the campaign led by Who Cares? Scotland.</p><p>I should mention that the committee will take evidence on school closures before stage 2. The Government intends to lodge amendments on that, and we want to hear from stakeholders, which will inform our scrutiny of those amendments.</p><p>The committee supports the bill&#8217;s aims of putting children and young people at the heart of the planning and delivery of services and of ensuring that their rights are respected throughout society. We welcome the Government&#8217;s aim of improving outcomes for children and young people and particularly those who are disadvantaged.</p><p>Other than on the named person provisions, the whole committee agreed with the bill&#8217;s general principles and we hope that our suggestions for improvement will help to make the bill stronger still.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22755174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am, of course, speaking today as the convener of the Education and Culture Committee.

I also thank the clerks; the witnesses who gave oral and written evidence to the committee, which was invaluable in our examination of the bill; the committee advisers, who did a sterling job in helping us through the process; and, of course, SPICe, which was also invaluable.</p><p>I want to pay particular attention to my fellow committee members. I think that we did a good job, in which we were full of respect for each other&#8217;s positions and concentrated on the bill and the work that we had to do, despite our differences on the central referendum question on independence itself.</p><p>Many people have said that this is a historic day because we are passing the bill. I agree. It is historic, but I also think that it is not very exciting. I do not mean that in a bad way; I say it because the whole process has been exceptionally well planned. The original bill that was introduced to the Parliament was very well drafted. Of course, there have been amendments to the bill as we have gone through the process and examined it in great detail, but the fact that it is not particularly exciting shows that the bill has been well planned and that the Government has done its job, and the committee has had a reasonably easy time in examining the process and procedures contained in the bill.</p><p>What a long way we have come since the 2011 election and the strident voices of the anti-independence parties, who said that they did not support independence and that they would not support a process to bring it about. I am glad that those voices have changed and that those parties have now decided that this is the right thing to do and accepted that the people of Scotland have the right to choose their own future. I am just sad that thus far they have failed to extend that logic to supporting that right across everything else. I cannot understand the logic of those who support Scotland having powers over health, but not welfare; over justice, but not defence; and over local tax, but not national tax. In my view, the arbitrary line that is drawn between devolved and reserved powers makes no sense whatsoever.</p><p>I cannot help but reflect on the difference between the relatively constructive and straightforward process that has surrounded the passage of the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill and, indeed, the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill, and the rather long and difficult debates&#8212;or, may I say, arguments&#8212;that took place around the most recent Scotland Bill. I served on the Scotland Bill Committee as well.</p><p>The fight to move us forward by such a small amount&#8212;by one inch&#8212;that surrounded the second Scotland Bill far exceeded anything that occurred during the passage of the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill. It is interesting that whereas we spent decades trying to get this place established, we spent a relatively short amount of time on the second Scotland Bill&#8212;although it was not the most constructive discussion that I have experienced. Despite the many protestations about support for devolution, more devolution and&#8212;among members of Tavish Scott&#8217;s party&#8212;home rule, the fact is that on every occasion that an amendment for additional power was lodged by SNP members, it was voted down by members who now say that they support lots of extra, new powers for the Parliament at some indistinct point in the future when, I suppose, they think that we might be ready.</p><p>Some issues around the bill raised questions. The question of purdah came up during the committee&#8217;s examination of the bill, and I welcome the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s clarity on that. We had questions about when the purdah period would fall, how long it should be and who it would cover. However, with the slight change that has been made even at stage 3, I think that we are in the right place with the length of the purdah period. It will also cover the right organisations. In short, I do not think that we need be concerned about that part of the bill.</p><p>As others have mentioned, there was a great deal of debate about campaign rules and spending limits in particular. Again, we are in the right place in that respect. I think that &#163;7,500 is the right amount and that the level of constrictions on organisations not only allows us to be sure that the process is fair and transparent but lets organisations across the country get involved, take part and be part of this&#8212;I use the phrase again&#8212;historic process that we are undertaking.</p><p>I am very pleased that the question of designation of lead campaigners by the time we reach the 16-week period of the referendum was cleared up at stage 2. After all, it would have been a rather strange state of affairs if those organisations had not been in place that close to the referendum.</p><p>I recently had a conversation with a Slovenian woman whom I met on a bus in Vilnius in Lithuania. We got chatting because she recognised that I was not a Lithuanian; when I said that I was from Scotland, she immediately said that she had heard that there might be a referendum on independence here and asked whether that was correct. When I confirmed that it was, indeed, true, she was very excited by the prospect and thought it was an amazing thing to be happening in Scotland. After asking me a number of questions about the referendum&#8212;what was happening, who was saying what and what it would cover&#8212;she finally asked me what I thought the result would be. &#8220;What are the polls saying?&#8221;, she asked. I asked her what she thought they were saying and, without hesitation and with absolute confidence, she said, &#8220;100 per cent yes.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, I wish it were.&#8221; When she guessed 90 per cent and then 80 per cent, I had to tell her the poll result that had been released just before I left for Lithuania. She was completely and utterly dumbfounded.

Some victims may not even realise that it is happening to them, because they are trapped in a controlling and abusive relationship, in which they live in fear and intimidation with no real idea of how to break free. At this point, I will say that I agree very much with Jackie Baillie that domestic abuse is, at its heart, an abuse of power. That is why organisations such as Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid are so important, and that is why it is worth celebrating the invaluable advice and support that it has offered to women, children and young people over the past 40 years.</p><p>I was delighted to be invited along to the 40th anniversary celebration at St Andrews in the Square in Glasgow last Friday, so it was with much regret that I was unable to attend. I should explain that I was unwell, but I would have been the third man there if I could have managed it. I apologise for my absence&#8212;I had thought that it would have gone unnoticed, but there were only two men there, so perhaps it was noticed. I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak in this evening&#8217;s debate and to pay tribute to the fantastic work that is carried out by Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid.</p><p>During the summer, I had the chance to visit the Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid offices in Bell Street. I met the chair of the GWA board, Jennifer Cairns, and the manager, Angela Devine, to discuss the support and refuge services that the service offers to victims of domestic abuse in Glasgow and West Scotland.</p><p>I was particularly impressed with GWA&#8217;s children and young people service and its ambitions to improve links in the community through an outreach service in local schools. That is a reminder that not only adults are affected by domestic abuse. Such projects help to change the attitudes of young people and raise awareness that support and advice is available.</p><p>Back in 2008, as the then Minister for Communities and Sport, I helped to launch the national domestic abuse delivery plan, which was an approach to tackling domestic abuse that was informed by the experiences of children and young people who had witnessed, or who had been part of, abusive relationships. Since then, the Scottish Government has continued to make tackling violence against women a national priority and has committed to supporting the work of organisations such as Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid.</p><p>Since 2007, the Scottish Government funding that is allocated to combat violence against women has increased by 62 per cent, with &#163;34.5&#160;million of investment committed between 2012 and 2015. It is a credit to the Parliament that the issue has cross-party support and that the political make-up of Governments has been of no relevance whatever; the attempts to tackle domestic abuse have been supported by all parties.</p><p>The Forced Marriage etc (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act 2011 and the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2011 are two important pieces of legislation that have helped to improve outcomes for victims of domestic abuse. However, domestic violence and abuse continue to blight the lives of too many women, families, children and communities in Scotland. There is no place in Scotland for violence against women, and I am confident that the Scottish Government&#8217;s new national violence against women strategy will help to move us another step closer to protecting women and children from all forms of violence.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Justice has continued to highlight the need to modernise Scotland&#8217;s criminal justice system to ensure that it better serves victims of rape and domestic violence. I accept that ending the absolute requirement for corroboration in criminal cases is controversial, as Sandra White mentioned, but I tend to share the view of Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid and Victim Support Scotland that, on balance, it is the right step. We must do all that we can to give victims the confidence to come forward and engage with the criminal justice system. In the past, too many have suffered in silence, behind closed doors.</p><p>The appointment of Anne Marie Hicks as specialist procurator fiscal for domestic abuse is also welcome. She brings a wealth of experience to the role, having led the Crown Office&#8217;s domestic abuse unit in Glasgow after spending a number of years working as a prosecutor in the west of Scotland. Anne Marie is committed to ensuring a robust prosecution policy that supports victims and brings perpetrators to justice.</p><p>I conclude by paying tribute to the many staff, volunteers, supporters and fundraisers who have contributed over the past 40 years to making Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid the organisation that it is today. As it advocates a multi-agency approach to tackling domestic violence, it would be remiss of me not to mention the partner organisations. Rape Crisis Scotland, Children 1st, White Ribbon Scotland, Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland, Zero Tolerance, the Scottish Refugee Council and many more support organisations work tirelessly to help to address domestic violence. I am grateful to Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid for all its work over the past 40 years. I look forward to seeing it continue to go from strength to strength in the years ahead&#8212;while, unfortunately, it is still needed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724850", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I begin by congratulating Sandra White on securing this important debate.

Folic acid, or vitamin B9, was identified in the late 1930s as part of the great increase in understanding of the vital nutrients naturally present in food that happened in the years between the wars. Folic acid was isolated in spinach leaves in the early 1940s, but it was not until 1960 that deficiency of folic acid was linked to neural tube defects in babies.</p><p>We all recognise that spina bifida and hydrocephalus are devastating conditions that cause paralysis and bowel problems, and often cause neurological problems. Nevertheless, the good news is that 72 per cent&#8212;nearly three quarters&#8212;of cases could be prevented by the simple act of adding folic acid to flour. The problem is that neural tube defects happen early in a pregnancy&#8212;often as early as the 28th day after conception&#8212;so unless folic acid supplementation is started before conception it is all too easy to miss that very small window in which a baby can be protected. That is why countries as diverse as Canada, the United States, South Africa, Chile and Australia have opted for mandatory supplementation of flour with folic acid. That ensures that all women in those countries of child-bearing age are getting the folic acid that they need in their diets.</p><p>Of course, as always with supplementation, there are risks that must be weighed in the balance. For example, in supplementing flour with folic acid there is a risk for the group of elderly people who have pernicious anaemia, whose symptoms could be masked by that supplementation. Any move to supplement flour with folic acid would therefore need to be accompanied by measures for health professionals to tackle pernicious anaemia, which is a vitamin B12 deficiency. However, that is entirely manageable, and with proper guidance to GPs it could be dealt with relatively straightforwardly.</p><p>It is important to point out that fortification of food is the norm and that it has been so for many years. Many foods in Scotland are already fortified. For example, by law in the UK, iron, thiamine and niacin must be added to flour as they are removed with bran during the milling of wheat. Margarine is also fortified by law with vitamins A and D.</p><p>Food supplementation has been with us for decades and dates back to the days of rationing, when the UK Government, armed with the knowledge that had been gained by scientists in the 20s and 30s, understood the consequences of rationing. It did that because of the work of, among others, our own John Boyd Orr in Glasgow&#8212;one of the foremost nutritional scientists of the 20th century and a man known as the father of modern nutrition. He knew that many people in Scotland had too little money to feed themselves and their families properly.</p><p>It is well known among health professionals that advice and knowledge are eagerly seized upon and utilised by the most educated and well-off sections of the population. Anne McTaggart mentioned that in her speech. That is not a bad thing, because if even one child is protected from a neural tube defect, we should be delighted. However, the danger&#8212;it is one that we, as legislators, have to consider&#8212;is that we leave the poorest and most vulnerable women and children in our society behind and unprotected.</p><p>If we fail to fortify flour with folic acid, we run the very real risk that people who do not have the money for folic acid supplements&#8212;we should not forget that the advice is to take folic acid supplements for at least three months before the woman gets pregnant, which is often an open-ended commitment&#8212;will not get the protection that better-off parts of the population receive. Many of those women are too pushed to think about supplementation, but they and their children need protection too. In addition, we must not ignore the fact that many pregnancies are not planned and therefore women will not have been taking folic acid as recommended. Supplementation would protect them as well.</p><p>The Food Standards Agency in Scotland recommends that there is mandatory fortification of bread or flour with folic acid, and it has done so since 2009. I am pleased to say that that is also SNP policy. I do not need to remind the minister of that. In a motion that I put before national conference in October 2006, conference agreed that the</p><p>&#8220;SNP supports the addition of folic acid to flour and/or other grain products sold in Scotland to dramatically reduce the number of children born in Scotland who suffer from neural tube defects.&#8221;</p><p>That is the great point&#8212;neural tube defects would drop like a stone if folic acid was added to flour and products made from flour.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716846", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Folic Acid Awareness Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join others in congratulating Malcolm Chisholm on securing this most important debate and in welcoming the Scottish Spina Bifida Association&#8217;s campaign.

The reality is that play is about much more than just having fun. Like many other members, as a parent, I recognise how important play is to the health and wellbeing of not only my daughter but Scotland&#8217;s children and young people.</p><p>The minister spoke of the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambition to make Scotland the best place in the world for a child to grow up, and I share her view that the development of Scotland&#8217;s first national play strategy and action plan will bring us another step closer to achieving that ambition. A strong evidence base and international research demonstrate that play is essential to enabling a child&#8217;s healthy development through to adolescence and into adulthood.</p><p>I recommend that members spend some time reviewing Play Scotland&#8217;s report &#8220;The Power of Play&#8221;, which provides an excellent overview of research and expert opinion and which shows that supporting play from an early age can give children the best possible start in life. For example, page 10 of the report says:</p><p>&#8220;Because playing includes such a wide variety of experiences it contributes in many different ways to children&#8217;s enjoyment and well-being. Imaginative and constructive play is thought to be particularly important for cognitive development whilst play involving art, craft and design helps children develop the fine motor skills needed for handwriting. A range of play experiences contribute to, for example, language development, problem-solving, memory and creativity and the exercise involved in physically active play helps increase fitness.&#8221;</p><p>That illustrates the range of benefits to children&#8217;s development when they are given the opportunity to participate in play. Play throughout childhood is a key part of learning physical, intellectual, emotional and social skills. It plays a crucial role in helping children to grow up to be healthy and productive members of society.</p><p>I have been fascinated by members&#8217; anecdotes about children&#8217;s games and games from long ago&#8212;by which I mean 1960. I recommend that members look at the Bruegel painting entitled &#8220;Children&#8217;s Games&#8221;, which was painted not in 1960 but in 1560. I saw it two weeks ago in the Kunsthistorisches museum in Vienna. It shows dozens of children playing dozens and dozens of games, nearly all of which are instantly recognisable, probably to every person in the chamber.</p><p>However, things have changed in the past 20 years. That is why it is essential that we have a national play strategy. We know that children are spending more of their time indoors and have an increasingly inactive and sedentary lifestyle. Recent research led by the University of Strathclyde into the physical activity of Scotland&#8217;s young people found that only 19 per cent of adolescent boys and 11 per cent of girls aged 11 to 15 do the recommended 60 minutes of moderate exercise per day. It was also found that 76 per cent of 11 to 15-year-olds watch more than two hours of television each day. That demonstrates the challenge that Scotland faces, with almost a third of Scottish children being categorised as overweight or obese.</p><p>However, the study also recognised the positive steps that the Scottish Government has taken to bring forward national policies, strategies and investment to improve opportunities for young people to participate in healthy activities. The Scottish Government&#8217;s on-going commitment to developing play opportunities for children can be seen in a variety of funding streams, including the &#163;3 million go2play programme, which is managed by Inspiring Scotland. That builds on the progress of the go play fund, which has helped to benefit a number of play initiatives in communities throughout the country.</p><p>One of the projects that has benefited from that support is based in my region in West Dunbartonshire, where the Environment Trust has been working to develop new spaces for play in local schools, parks and streets. Pupils at St Mary&#8217;s primary school in Alexandria worked in conjunction with the trust to design and create a new Scandinavian-style free play space in the school playground to better facilitate outdoor play and learning.</p><p>The national play strategy focuses on strengthening the play infrastructure in Scotland to ensure that children and young people have better opportunities to participate in play. The latest Scottish household survey found that around nine out of 10 households with children aged six to 12 typically have access to at least one form of play area in their neighbourhood, such as a park, playground, field or open space. That is encouraging, but there is certainly much more that we can do to ensure that children and young people have access to suitable play areas in their community settings and public spaces. Members have made clear some of the pressures that are brought to bear on those open spaces through the desire of some to build on them and remove the opportunities for children to use them as open recreational areas.</p><p>A number of alternative funding routes are available to help to develop better play provision for young people, such as the cashback for communities initiative and Big Lottery Fund funding. The action plan highlights the need to showcase the positive impact of play to potential funding bodies. I know that the Big Lottery Fund in particular has facilitated a number of fantastic community projects for children and young people across Scotland.</p><p>In East Renfrewshire, Cosgrove Care, which is a local charity that specialises in providing support for people with learning disabilities, was recently awarded a grant from the Big Lottery Fund&#8217;s young start fund for a project to enable children from eight to 12 with differing learning disabilities to take part in horse-riding activities.</p><p>Teachers at the Isobel Mair school, which is a school for children with special needs and is also based in East Renfrewshire, successfully applied to the awards for all fund to establish a sports and drama programme for pupils at the school who have additional support needs.</p><p>Those are two worthwhile local projects to highlight in particular, as they cater for young people with disabilities who have been shown to face barriers to play opportunities due to inadequate provision in mainstream play facilities. I particularly welcome the Conservative amendment, which highlights that particular point.</p><p>I know that Capability Scotland has been a key stakeholder in the development of the national play strategy, and I am certain that it has emphasised the need to take into account the challenges that young disabled people face in accessing the same play opportunities that non-disabled children access.</p><p>I pay tribute to the range of stakeholders across the children&#8217;s sector, including Play Scotland, Inspiring Scotland and Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, whom Christian Allard mentioned earlier, that have all worked together to bring forward Scotland&#8217;s first national play strategy. I know that a wide range of views and opinions have gone into making that possible. Everyone&#8212;teachers, parents, health workers, volunteers, carers, youth workers and, indeed, young people&#8212;has a role to play in taking forward the action plan, promoting the positive benefits of play, and enabling quality play opportunities for all Scotland&#8217;s children and young people, irrespective of their ability or, indeed, disability.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is too easy to dismiss play as a trivial activity for children.

Of course there are legitimate questions to be asked, but that is what the committee is doing. That is its role.

In particular, I thank citizens of Scotland who have a learning disability, who have been at the heart of the strategy&#8217;s development.</p><p>Our main focus today is to debate the new strategy, but first I want to contextualise what it means to be a Scottish citizen and have a learning disability. The exact number of people with a learning disability in Scotland is unknown, but according to published statistics approximately 16,000 school-age children and young people and 26,000 adults have a learning disability and require support.</p><p>Our population of citizens with learning disabilities is not a homogeneous group. Some people with learning disabilities will require just a little support, while others with more complex needs will rely entirely on family members and paid carers for all aspects of daily life.</p><p>What is true is that every person with a learning disability is an individual like you and me, with hopes, aspirations, dreams and rights. Like many nations, we have a shameful history of policy and law that aimed to reduce the social problem of learning disability through segregation, isolation and&#8212;unthinkable today&#8212;sterilisation. In finding a solution to the historically viewed burden of people with learning disabilities, we have come from the acceptable place of segregation in the earlier part of the 20th century through recent manifestations of community care and eventually to today&#8217;s position where citizens with learning disabilities have the right to individualised budgets and personalised support. There is therefore much to welcome in this new learning disabilities strategy.</p><p>We of course believe that every citizen has the right to live longer, healthier lives. I believe that providing person-centred, safe and compassionate care that protects individual rights and empowers independence is a fundamental duty of our society, our services and indeed our Government. That is why I firmly support this new strategy. It does not purport to suggest that all is well; it acknowledges both the distance that we have come since the publication of the first learning disabilities policy in Scotland, &#8220;The same as you?&#8221;&#8212;and I must heap praise on the previous Executive for bringing that forward&#8212;and where our collective journey should take us to in future.</p><p>The strategy acknowledges that many people with learning disabilities would like to work, live independently, have meaningful relationships and feel safe within their communities. However, almost 9,000 adults with learning disabilities in Scotland live with a family carer, and 14 per cent of them with a family carer aged over 50; fewer than one in 20 adults with a learning disability is in any form of paid work; and research has shown that two out of every five children born to parents with learning disabilities are permanently removed from their care.</p><p>As I mentioned in my intervention on the minister, the Education and Culture Committee&#8217;s report, which was published yesterday, provides evidence from learning disabled parents about their absolute desire to be treated as individuals and to have their cases treated on a case-by-case basis. They felt&#8212;with some justification&#8212;that the permanent removal of 40 per cent of children born to parents with learning disabilities was not something that happened in the normal daily run of things.</p><p>There is still much work to be done. Nevertheless, the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013, which was introduced earlier this year, will empower individuals to have greater control over decisions affecting their lives, including the support required to live as independent, as safe and as meaningful a life as possible.</p><p>As I have said, the exact number of people with learning disabilities in Scotland is unknown. I would now like to turn my attention to that issue and, indeed, the issue that makes up the main body of this new strategy&#8212;health inequalities.</p><p>I have read with dismay the early mortality statistics for people with learning disabilities that other members have mentioned, with some reports from England suggesting that men die up to 13 years earlier and women up to 20 years earlier. The important point is that most of those deaths were unexpected, premature and avoidable. I am also aware that those findings are supported by the determinations of a number of fatal accident inquiries in Scotland. That is simply unacceptable, and it is why I whole-heartedly endorse the strategy&#8217;s recommendations that aim to understand the causes of such unacceptable early mortality rates and place a duty on local NHS partners to implement change.</p><p>We have moved from our shameful out-of-sight, out-of-mind service provisions to a position of inclusion and, I hope, individuality&#8212;or have we? People with learning disabilities remain invisible in our routinely collected health data, and we are unable to measure, trend or predict the health of our citizens with learning disabilities. That is why I welcome and warmly endorse the creation of the Scottish learning disability observatory and eagerly await its outputs. It should provide us with the evidence and information that we require to take further action to right this unacceptable position.</p><p>The strategy also acknowledges the differences in health presentations between Scotland&#8217;s general population and people with learning disabilities; acknowledges the difference in the leading cause of death and in cancer presentations; and acknowledges that public health measures for all citizens of Scotland that have been developed with the best of intentions can in fact widen the health inequality gap for citizens who have a learning disability.</p><p>I warmly welcome the strategy&#8217;s recommendations, which seek to address the matter. I particularly welcome the recommendation to seek to develop a health improvement, efficiency and governance, access and treatment&#8212;HEAT&#8212;target for our NHS to ensure that people with learning disabilities are visible in routinely collected data and importantly, as other members have mentioned, to ensure that the new GP contract in Scotland will best meet the needs of our citizens who have a learning disability.</p><p>The new strategy further acknowledges that people with learning disabilities have the right to access the full range of services that all citizens of Scotland access. It also rightly acknowledges that, from time to time, some people with a learning disability will require reasonable adjustments, including access to specialist support to enable access to mainstream services.</p><p>Citizens of Scotland who have a learning disability have the right to safe, effective and person-centred healthcare, and we have the responsibility to ensure that that is delivered every time. Citizens of Scotland who have a learning disability have the right to work, and we have the responsibility to ensure that that happens. Citizens of Scotland who have a learning disability have the right to affordable housing with the right support, and we have the responsibility to ensure that that is delivered. Finally, citizens of Scotland who have a learning disability have the right to feel safe. We have the responsibility to ensure that that is the case not just some of the time, but all the time.</p><p>I very much welcome the new learning disability strategy and look forward to all citizens with learning disabilities in Scotland being given the keys to their lives.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697328", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Learning Disabilities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank everyone who has been involved in developing the new learning disability strategy, &#8220;The keys to life&#8221;.

The issue is not that voting is a privilege&#8212;it is a right; and as a society, when we impose custodial sentences, we remove from individuals not just their right to vote but their right to liberty and their right to a family life, for example. Judges and sheriffs are well aware of the impact of imposing a custodial sentence, and I prefer to leave the decision to them.</p><p>When it comes to the principle, the dividing line is not between the rights of short-term prisoners and the rights of long-term prisoners; it is between those who are in prison and those who are not in prison.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695131", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Fundamentally, there are two arguments here.

As a member who has been in the Parliament for more than 10 years and, I think, as a rather experienced committee convener, I believe that, frankly, members risk breaking trust in a committee if they sign up to a recommendation in a report and then come to the chamber and oppose that recommendation. That is a mistake, although it is up to members if that is what they wish to do.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of our justice system and our society as a whole can be judged by how we treat the victims of crime. Similarly, it should be recognised that witnesses of crime carry out an important civic duty, and we must offer them appropriately tailored support and confidence that their personal safety will be ensured, in addition to providing them with an adequate level of knowledge to contribute effectively to the cases in which they are involved.</p><p>I believe that the Scottish Government&#8217;s making justice work programme will improve the standards of treatment for victims and witnesses as well as improving the criminal justice system as a whole. Constituents have outlined to me&#8212;and, I am sure, to other members&#8212;their experiences of crime. The clear psychological and financial pressures of being a victim of crime are self-evident. The trauma and emotional burden of such events are far reaching and can often affect entire families and communities.</p><p>While trying to overcome what can often be traumatic events, victims must also try to deal with everyday practicalities. Under normal circumstances, it can often be difficult for people to manage their life, finances and personal relationships effectively. When people are given the additional burden of recovering from the emotional scars of a disruptive criminal event in their life, we must do everything that we can to support them. That can also be applied to witnesses to crime, who should be able to count on the law&#8217;s full support, as their contribution is essential to an effective justice system.</p><p>New measures such as the victim surcharge could help to strengthen the perception among victims that the perpetrators of crime are being held to account for the damage that they have caused. I welcome the structure of priorities that has been put forward for the consideration of the amount that an offender needs to pay&#8212;namely, the prioritising of the compensation payment, followed by the victim surcharge and then the principal fine.</p><p>As Victim Support Scotland highlighted in its consultation response,</p><p>&#8220;compensation following a crime is often of deeper significance than simply receiving a financial award. Of central importance is the formal acknowledgement and recognition of the suffering of the victim, as well as a validation that what the victim says is true. As such, compensation is an important part in the victim&#8217;s recovery process.&#8221;</p><p>Any requirement for a compensation payment to the victim should ensure that the payment is made as soon as possible. Failure to do so might ultimately lead the victim to further feelings of victimisation and could prevent them from having some form of closure.</p><p>I understand that, in some cases, receiving money from the offender might be distressing for the victim. I would welcome further assurances from the cabinet secretary that the views and needs of victims will continue to be considered before each individual decision is made on the appropriateness or otherwise of imposing a compensation order.</p><p>When looking through the consultation, I was encouraged to see the level of engagement in the process, with 59 organisations sending submissions to the Scottish Government. A number of consistent themes emerged from the submissions, two of which I would like to highlight.</p><p>First, the consultation responses repeatedly highlighted the need for victims and witnesses to have access to information that is consistent, clear and accessible. The creation of an online information hub will assist in the development of that principle and, if implemented effectively, will greatly assist in improving accessibility.</p><p>I note the Justice Committee&#8217;s concerns that the online information hub should not be a replacement for human interaction and support for victims. I therefore welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s clarification that any new online information hub would act only as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, the vital face-to-face support that victims obviously need and already receive.</p><p>Secondly, allowing victims to access more general practical information about the justice system is another welcome measure. Previous constituency cases in which I have been involved have shown that constituents would welcome measures that give them a better understanding of procedures that have the potential to have a significant impact on their lives. I also understand that constituents would feel a greater sense of engagement with the criminal justice system more generally if they were given more case-specific information that is relevant to their circumstances. Indeed, any additional support or information could alleviate the frustrations that victims often feel as a result of having no previous knowledge or experience of the justice system.</p><p>Consultation responses also consistently called for victims and witnesses to have access to information that gives them an accurate appraisal of their active role within the system as an extension to the proposal of an online information hub. If the participants have greater understanding, it will lead to an overall more engaging experience and ensure that their expectations are managed more effectively.</p><p>Victims and witnesses should not be made to feel that their role has been downplayed to such an extent that they feel undervalued or detached from the process; nor should their part be overinflated such that their expectations of an active role cannot realistically be met.</p><p>In particular, clarity has been sought about the definition of &#8220;participate effectively&#8221; when referring to a victim&#8217;s or witness&#8217;s active participation. A number of organisations expressed confusion in their consultation responses about what exactly that term implied. Other members, including the convener of the Justice Committee, raised that point earlier. I hope that the cabinet secretary is able to offer additional clarity on the concerns that the Justice Committee raised on that point.</p><p>The Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill is relatively broad in its scope, and there are a number of other points that I would like to be examined in further detail. The extension of the victim notification scheme, the establishment of the national confidential forum and the improvement of support for vulnerable witnesses are all worthy of further debate. However, I am pleased to note the Justice Committee&#8217;s support for the general principles of the bill and I am delighted that the Scottish Government has continued to commit to improving the experiences of people within the justice system.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694151", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on a subject that goes straight to the central purpose of the justice system&#8212;namely, the role of victims and witnesses of crime in that system.

As others have pointed out, Scotland is the only part of the UK to have a guardianship service. I am pleased that, after its successful 30-month pilot, the Scottish Government has committed to funding it for the next three years.</p><p>I am sorry that Liam McArthur has left the chamber because he seemed to suggest&#8212;I hope that I am not wrong here&#8212;that the reason for the higher than average granting of asylum in Scotland is to do with the cohort of countries that children and young people come from. The Aberlour Child Care Trust said in its briefing for this debate:</p><p>&#8220;The higher than average grant of asylum to separated children in Scotland cannot be attributed to the predominance of certain countries of origin in the cohort of young people who have received a Service.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that Liam McArthur simply misunderstood the briefing.</p><p>I am slightly concerned that there is no central listing of all the separated children and young people in Scotland or indeed in the UK. Such children are recorded only at local authority level. That must make the work of the Scottish guardianship service more complex, because it must apply to each local authority to find out about unaccompanied children in the authority&#8217;s care. I would appreciate hearing the minister&#8217;s view on putting in place a more organised data collection system, so that discrepancies between what is known centrally and what is known by agencies and local authorities can be overcome.</p><p>I read with interest the evaluations of the Scottish guardianship service that Professor Heaven Crawley and Professor Ravi Kohli produced in December 2011 and earlier this year. It is heartening to find that stakeholders&#8217; views have developed and become more positive as time has gone on and the service&#8217;s work has become clearer and better understood. For example, in the 2012 survey of stakeholders, 74 per cent of respondents thought that the service</p><p>&#8220;helped the young person to participate as fully as possible in the asylum process&#8221;,</p><p>compared with only 48 per cent in 2011.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the UK Border Agency was not as positive in its view of the guardianship service. Professors Crawley and Kohli reported:</p><p>&#8220;Case Owners in UKBA were largely of the view that Guardians had not made any difference to the decision making process, at least as far as the final outcome was concerned&#8221;,</p><p>although case owners agreed that, because the guardians worked mainly with the legal representative, their input might be largely invisible to them.</p><p>We know that case owners were wrong, in that guardians can and do make a difference&#8212;sometimes all the difference&#8212;to the outcome of cases. In one case, a young girl called Patience was refused asylum because the UKBA believed that she was a member of an ethnic group that lives in urban areas and does not practise female genital mutilation. Patience said that she was a member of an ethnic group that lives in remote rural areas in her country of origin and practises FGM. It became clear to Patience&#8217;s guardian that she was unfamiliar with and fearful of the urban environment, including escalators, trains and traffic lights. When Patience appealed the UKBA decision, her guardian provided extensive evidence in that regard and a letter of support. Patience was eventually granted refugee status.</p><p>In another case, Husain, who was almost 18, was waiting for a decision on his asylum application. He was being supported by social services but he was due to be moved on to adult services and asylum support. His guardian lobbied for social work to continue to accommodate Husain until his asylum support application had been dealt with, to prevent him from having to be moved into Home Office accommodation. He was moved directly into national asylum support service accommodation as soon as the accommodation became available, which significantly reduced the number of moves he had to make.</p><p>Guardians do not just make a difference to the outcome of asylum appeals; they provide help and support at many levels. The dedicated guardian helps the child or young person to navigate the asylum system and rebuild their life here in Scotland. Guardians act as independent advocates for the child, assisting them with everything from dealing with lawyers to helping them to build social networks.</p><p>For example, a guardian helped a newly arrived young person, who could speak no English, to gain a place on a photography project so that he could focus on visual images. That might seem odd, but the boy met other young asylum seekers from his country on the course and began to have a wider circle of friends. He is now on a course for English for speakers of other languages and he hopes to move on to a photography course in the near future. The guardian&#8217;s inspired help provided that young person with a focus, an ambition, a means of expressing himself and a new group of friends. What a difference one course made to the life of a boy who came to a country in which he could not speak the language, with no friends and no family.</p><p>Ultimately, the most important measure of the service&#8217;s success is the views of the children whom the guardians support. The service was designed to deliver two outcomes, which members mentioned. The first is:</p><p>&#8220;To ensure that each child will have a significantly improved experience and understanding of the immigration and welfare processes, evidenced by the child&#8217;s informed participation and that they receive services and responses appropriate to their needs and entitlements&#8221;.</p><p>The second is:</p><p>&#8220;To develop a child-centred model of practice that promotes interagency working and provides better information upon which to base immigration decisions&#8221;.</p><p>If the children and young people did not believe that their guardians were an asset, the service would have failed.</p><p>The young people overwhelmingly had a positive view of their guardians. Indeed, the report by Professors Crawley and Kohli states that their reports were in many cases glowing. Here is one young person&#8217;s report:</p><p>&#8220;Big interview in Home Office. My Social Worker is not come. My Guardian go with me. It was hard questions. Big interview. She help me to find break time, and explain big questions to me.&#8221;</p><p>Frankly, given their level of English, that young person would have been in an impossible situation without the support that their guardian provided.</p><p>We must not forget how young these people are. During the period of the evaluation, 81 young people were allocated to a guardian. The majority of those referred to the service were between 15 and 17-years-old, although some were younger and, to be fair, some were assessed and found to be older than they had originally stated.</p><p>Often the young people had no idea of the whereabouts of their parents. Some had been abandoned and others&#8217; parents had perhaps died. More than a third of the young people knew that their parents were living in other countries. Imagine what it is to be 15&#8212;my own daughter is 15&#8212;and to be on your own in a country where you know no one, do not speak the language and have to apply for asylum and talk to professionals such as lawyers. These young people have no home, no family, no friends and no money and some of them are not literate in any language. How frightening and difficult must their lives be? Their guardians are literally a lifeline, providing friendship, continuity and support.</p><p>I am delighted that the Scottish Government is doing the right thing by these young people, and I hope that the rest of the UK soon follows our example.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693870", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Guardianship Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted that Scotland has met the UNHCR&#8217;s guidelines on international protection, which state that an independent qualified guardian should be appointed immediately, free of charge, for all separated children.

We know that Labour supports tuition fees, because it introduced them in Scotland and Gordon Brown introduced them elsewhere in the UK. In fact, Labour is a big fan of fees.</p><p>I was particularly interested&#8212;indeed, intrigued&#8212;by the bold assertion in the Labour motion</p><p>&#8220;That the Parliament ... believes that lower-income students are being financially disadvantaged in Scotland compared to elsewhere in the UK&#8221;.</p><p>That came as something of a surprise to me, given that Robin Parker, the president of NUS Scotland, called the Scottish Government&#8217;s support package &#8220;very welcome news indeed&#8221; and went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Abolishing fees, protecting places and improving student support are the foundations on which we can achieve fair access.&#8221;</p><p>Perhaps the NUS is wrong and Labour is right on this matter; I know that it is unlikely but, as it could theoretically be possible I decided to check Labour&#8217;s claim and see what it is so keen for us to adopt by comparing two students, one in Scotland and the other in England. In carrying out this comparison, I wanted to be fair to Labour and have therefore focused on the very students it mentions in its motion. Both students come from households with incomes of &#163;15,000 and they are doing the same course but at different institutions, one in Scotland and one in England. In 2013-14, the Scottish student will receive &#163;7,250 in a combination of bursaries and loans while the English student will receive less than that&#8212;&#163;7,177&#8212;again through a combination of loans and bursaries. However, the Scottish student will pay zero&#8212;absolutely nothing&#8212;in tuition fees, while the English student will have to pay fees.</p><p>Sally Hunt, the general secretary of the University and College Union, which is the lecturers union, said:</p><p>&#8220;When pushing higher fees through the Parliament&#8221;</p><p>UK ministers</p><p>&#8220;promised that fees above &#163;6,000 would be the exception rather than rule.&#8221;</p><p>However, the Office for Fair Access checked that and found that, of the 122 higher education institutions that were included in its report, which covered those that receive Higher Education Funding Council for England income and have full-time undergraduates, every single one charges more than the basic fee of &#163;6,000 per year.</p><p>Again, I want to be fair to Labour. I do not want to use the maximum fee of &#163;9,000 in my comparison, because that would be unfair. I cannot use the minimum fee of &#163;6,000, because nobody charges it. So what about the average fee? The 2013-14 fee in England will be &#163;8,507. Again, I want to be fair, because I am sure that Labour, the Tories and indeed the Lib Dems&#8212;if they were here&#8212;would say, &#8220;But what about all the additional support they get? What about the fee waivers, the bursaries, the Office for Fair Access agreements and all of that?&#8221; Well, the Office for Fair Access has commented on that. It said:</p><p>&#8220;Taking bursaries, scholarships and fee waivers into account reduces the average fee to &#163;7,898&#8221;.</p><p>In other words, the OFA says that, when all university and Government financial support is taken into account, the average fee is around &#163;7,900 per year. Therefore, after all factors such as loans, bursaries, fees and all the other support are included, a financially disadvantaged student in Scotland will accrue in effect a debt of &#163;5,500 from their loan, while an identical student in England will accrue a debt of &#163;11,721 in a single year&#8212;more than twice as much as that of the student in Scotland.</p><p>If we go down the road that Labour wants us to go down, Scottish students from lower-income households will receive less support and gain debt levels of more than double those that students currently face under the Scottish system.

Despite the tight timescale before the draft royal charter is to be sent to the Privy Council, and after speaking to colleagues on the committee and checking the forward work programme with the clerks, it became clear that it would be possible for our committee to take evidence over two meetings immediately after the Easter recess. I am glad to say that the idea gained further support when, in answer to a topical question from Clare Adamson MSP, the cabinet secretary, Fiona Hyslop, indicated her support for a parliamentary committee taking evidence on the matter.</p><p>Therefore, on 16 and 23 April, the Education and Culture Committee took evidence from a range of witnesses, including Lord McCluskey, newspaper editors, the NUJ, Mrs Watson, who gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry about press intrusion, and the cabinet secretary. I thank all the witnesses who came before the committee and gave us evidence at such short notice.</p><p>Although the committee took the matter extremely seriously and would have wished to spend more time considering all the factors surrounding the royal charter and press regulation, we were unable to do so, as the UK Government decided that the royal charter was to be put to the Privy Council in early May. Therefore, we had a maximum of two weeks to consider the matter. That is not a criticism of the UK Government or anybody else; I merely want to inform members of the timeline that the committee faced.</p><p>Our first evidence session started with Lord McCluskey, who informed us of the work of the expert group and the reasons for the conclusions that it arrived at. There is no doubt that there is a well-founded argument for the view that Lord McCluskey&#8217;s group arrived at. Margaret Watson stated in her evidence that she supported the action that the group proposed, but many others, including newspaper editors, were opposed to the proposal.</p><p>Lord McCluskey was right to point out to us that the royal charter as drafted did not cover Scotland. He also pointed out clearly what incentives and disincentives&#8212;the so-called carrots and sticks&#8212;would be available in Scotland if we supported the royal charter proposal.</p><p>We do not have exemplary damages in Scots law and there seems to be no support for introducing them. Indeed, some doubt was cast on their compatibility with the European convention on human rights in any case. Although there was some discussion about using costs instead of exemplary damages, the committee had no time to investigate the viability of such a proposal.</p><p>In the absence of carrots and sticks, the expert group has a strong case for arguing for its conclusions, so the committee was keen to know two things from the cabinet secretary: what carrots and sticks did the Government propose for Scotland; and how did it intend to make the royal charter fit Scots law and the devolved settlement?</p><p>Before taking evidence from the cabinet secretary on those questions, we heard from newspaper editors, who stated clearly their opposition to any system other than the one of their choosing. They opposed the royal charter and the McCluskey proposals but, in spite of their somewhat colourful descriptions of the end of a free press as we know it, provided no evidence to support the idea that if regulation was introduced through any of the suggested models, they would be unable to cover in future any story that they had covered in the past. They made a strong case, however, for the freedom of the press within the bounds of the law and for keeping politicians away from control of what the press can and cannot do in a free society. They were somewhat less convincing in arguing that the proposed royal charter on self-regulation of the press could somehow be equated with political control of the press.</p><p>I will turn briefly to one of the issues on which Margaret Watson gave evidence to the committee&#8212;namely, press respect for the recently deceased. That is a difficult issue to deal with. It is clear that the relatives of someone who has died feel strongly about press intrusion.</p><p>The committee was sympathetic to the points that Mrs Watson made, but the editors&#8217; arguments about the right of the press to publish material about someone who has died&#8212;they gave the example of publishing material about the activities of a criminal who has been shot in the street by a rival&#8212;were strong.</p><p>It is fair to say that the committee was sympathetic to the idea of finding a compromise that allows for respect for the person who has recently died without blocking legitimate reporting by the press. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments today on that matter.</p><p>The cabinet secretary was the final witness. The committee asked her about the two main issues: the draft royal charter not covering Scotland; and what incentives could be used in Scotland. On the first point, she was helpful and provided the committee with examples of draft amendments to the royal charter that, if accepted, would make the charter apply here. She also gave two examples of possible carrots and sticks: arbitration and public information notices going to publications that sign up to the recognised body.</p><p>The committee then had to come to a conclusion based on that short consideration of the options. After some discussion, we arrived at the view that we supported the proposal for a royal charter on self-regulation of the press with the addition of appropriate carrots and sticks to fit Scots law and the devolved circumstances.</p><p>Given the industry&#8217;s desire for any new system to be as straightforward as possible, the committee accepted the view that there should, if possible, be a single UK system. In addition, the evidence from the cabinet secretary about how the draft royal charter could be made to cover Scotland via some relatively minor amendments and the explanation of what carrots and sticks might be used in Scotland led us to the conclusion that we should support the royal charter.</p><p>Assuming that the UK Government makes the necessary changes to the draft royal charter to make it applicable to Scotland and that the powers of the Scottish Parliament in this devolved area are protected to allow a future Parliament to move in a different direction if the newspaper industry fails to heed the warnings about this being a final opportunity to put its house in order, I am&#8212;and, I believe, all the committee is&#8212;happy to support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689722", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Press Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although I am not speaking in my capacity as convener of the Education and Culture Committee, it might be helpful to members if I explain a little more about the committee&#8217;s role in the process.

I also thank those who provided evidence to the committee, the clerks, and the Scottish Parliament information centre, which provided assistance throughout the stage 1 process.</p><p>I make it clear that I am in speaking in my capacity as committee convener, which provides me with an opportunity to discuss the main issues in our report in more detail. I will also look ahead to stage 2&#8212;assuming that the bill passes stage 1.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report sets out various areas where further information is required before we will be in a position to consider amendments. The report notes the broad and strong support for the general policy direction; it also raises a number of questions about some of the specific approaches that are being adopted.</p><p>I should say at this point that the committee was split on whether to support the bill&#8217;s general principles. The majority of members supported those, whereas others expressed concern about whether the legislation would achieve them. All members noted some concern about the specific means by which the bill would achieve some of the general principles. I will address some of those concerns and questions as I go through our views on the bill, provision by provision.</p><p>I doubt that any member is unaware of the educational, cultural and economic importance of Scotland&#8217;s higher education institutions. Our universities punch well above their weight internationally, and I believe that no Government&#8212;or party&#8212;would seek to jeopardise their world-class reputation. Although university reform should therefore be conducted with caution, the Parliament should not run the risk of being overly timid in its approach. Higher education institutions spend considerable amounts of public money, and we rightly expect to derive a public benefit in return.</p><p>A major aim of the bill is to improve university governance. The trade unions that provided evidence forcefully made the case for that, citing universities&#8217; weakness in relation to scrutiny, transparency and widening access as reasons for reform.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s response to those perceived weaknesses is set out in section 2 of the bill. Essentially, higher education institutions are</p><p>&#8220;to comply with any principles of governance or management&#8221;</p><p>identified by Scottish Ministers.</p><p>It is fair to say that university principals and chairs are worried that the provisions on governance may give too much power to Scottish ministers and jeopardise their institutions&#8217; responsible autonomy. In other words, they expressed the belief that universities can best deliver public benefit when they have clear autonomy to do so. In our report, we have asked the cabinet secretary to explain whether those concerns should be addressed by amending the bill at stage 2.</p><p>While we were scrutinising the bill at stage 1, a steering group was developing a new Scottish code of good higher education governance. We understand that the code&#8212;which is due to be published in April&#8212;will become the &#8220;principles of governance&#8221; referred to in the bill.</p><p>The committee had a number of questions about the code, and in our report we have asked the cabinet secretary to explain how it will be signed off, whether it will address the issue of gender inequality on university governing bodies, and how it will avoid straying into the management, as opposed to the governance, of universities. Given that the code was not available before the end of stage 1, the committee will take further evidence on the content of the code before commencing stage 2.</p><p>I hope that everyone present agrees that our universities should be places where all those with the ability to flourish are admitted. However, it is strikingly apparent from the evidence that we heard that some groups of people, particularly those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, are not as well represented in university as others. The bill seeks to address that deficit.</p><p>The committee welcomed the principle of widening access and the cabinet secretary&#8217;s recent financial commitment to that policy. However, we have asked for further information from the Scottish Government.</p><p>First, we want to know how the risk that universities will adopt weak access targets can be avoided. We do not want&#8212;or anticipate&#8212;such an outcome but, to put it charitably, progress on widening access could perhaps have been a little quicker over the years. As the cabinet secretary acknowledged, universities will maintain autonomy in determining admissions. We also heard from Scottish Government officials that universities are unlikely to face financial penalties for failing to hit targets. Therefore, the committee has requested some clarification on how the bill will be made to work.</p><p>Secondly, we have asked for confirmation that the very welcome Scottish Government funding for retention activities will continue in future years, because there is not much point in widening access if the students who benefit then simply drop out of university.</p><p>Although the bill allows for the establishment of widening access agreements, what is crucial is whether the intended outcomes are delivered. We have therefore requested an annual update from the Scottish funding council on the progress that is being made on access and retention. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments in his reply to the committee&#8217;s report in that regard.</p><p>Much has been said inside and outside the Parliament about tuition fees. In the evidence that we took on the provision on tuition fees, the arguments that we heard were well rehearsed and were undoubtedly familiar to all members. The unions restated their opposition to tuition fees and said that students from the rest of the UK who studied in Scotland could face the highest-cost education system in the UK, but Universities Scotland challenged that evidence. It pointed out that the average Scottish fee is &#8220;spectacularly&#8221; below the average English fee, and that around 30 per cent of degree courses in England last for four years or more.</p><p>In effect, the bill puts on a legislative basis an existing agreement that Scottish institutions will cap the level of tuition fees that they charge students from the rest of the UK. The committee supported the general principles of the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach to the fees cap.</p><p>I turn to college regionalisation, which forms the most substantial part of the bill and on which we took a large amount of evidence. There was praise for the bill&#8217;s aims and the wider reform process, but several witnesses criticised the bill and the wider process. The changes that the bill proposes and the separate continuing process of college mergers will result in a significant restructuring of Scottish colleges. There will be regions with a single college&#8212;that will be the case here in Edinburgh, for example&#8212;as well as multicollege regions in Glasgow and Lanarkshire. New regional boards will be created for Glasgow and Lanarkshire, which will distribute funding and plan provision across the region. Individual colleges in those areas will be known as assigned colleges.</p><p>In the light of comments by the Scottish funding council, we particularly asked the cabinet secretary for a detailed explanation of the relationship between regional boards and assigned colleges. Specifically, the committee sought clarity on lines of funding and accountability between the two levels of governance. We also wanted to understand how regional boards will meet the needs of students and business without becoming overly bureaucratic or consuming precious resources.</p><p>The bill will also allow the funding council to review the provision of fundable further and higher education to ensure that it is provided in a coherent manner. Such a review could include consideration of the number of post-16 education bodies and of the learning and courses that they provide. The provision in question does not appear to radically alter the funding council&#8217;s existing powers in that regard, although Scottish Government officials said that it would give the funding council</p><p>&#8220;a clearer mandate to discuss with institutions evidence of, for example, unnecessary duplication that is to the detriment of learners and wider public investment.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 15 January 2013; c 1745.]</p><p>Universities Scotland criticised the proposals. It said that it was not the funding council&#8217;s responsibility to decide on the number of fundable higher education institutions and went on to set out some of the potential problems that a higher education institution could face if it were known that it was under review. Although the cabinet secretary and the funding council sought to reassure Universities Scotland, we have asked the Scottish Government to consider whether the bill could be amended to provide further reassurance to universities.</p><p>I turn to the provisions in the bill that concern data sharing.

In a press release in 2011 entitled, &#8220;No price tag on education&#8221;, which is still on the Labour Party&#8217;s website, he said:</p><p>&#8220;Education is the single most important lever in transforming people&#8217;s lives. From our youngest children learning to read, to research scientists on the cutting edge of new discoveries, education drives our futures and also Scotland&#8217;s ability to create wealth and opportunity ... if I am first minister, a Labour government will not introduce any up-front fees or graduate contribution for access to higher education in the lifetime of the next Parliament. There will be no price tag on education.&#8221;</p><p>I am sorry to have to tell Iain Gray that Johann Lamont and Hugh Henry disagree with him. They think that there is a price to be put on education. I am sorry that the Labour Party in Scotland has descended so far.</p><p>It is no coincidence that admissions to higher education institutions in Scotland are up at a time when the Scottish National Party is delivering the best student support package in the UK. We have no tuition fees for Scotland-domiciled students, thanks to the SNP, and figures from the Student Loans Company show that Scottish students have the lowest level of student debt in the UK. The average Scottish student loan is &#163;6,480, compared with &#163;17,140 in England. From this year, students will be eligible for a minimum income of &#163;7,250 if the family income is less than &#163;17,000.</p><p>That is an excellent record, but we are not content with the improvements that we have made. Through the Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill, the Scottish Government will introduce measures to widen access to funded higher education for people from the most deprived backgrounds. Higher education makes a profound difference to the life of an individual and his or her children. As Iain Gray helpfully pointed out, over only a few generations it also makes a profound difference to society as a whole. Education is a way to improve individuals&#8217; lives and society as a whole. I agree with what Iain Gray said, when he believed that.</p><p>Scotland is doing well in education. We have three universities in the top 100&#8212;Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews&#8212;and we are ranked fourth in the world in research impact. We produce 1.8 per cent of the world&#8217;s published research, despite having less than 0.1 per cent of the world&#8217;s population. We do not do that by having policies that mean that only the richest Scots can go on to higher education; we do it by encouraging the most able among us to continue their education.</p><p>The Labour Party is deciding whether to abandon its pledge of no tuition fees, so that only people who have the wealth to do so can carry on with their education. However, the wealth of a country is in its people. If people are educated, wealth is created. It is not the case that education should be provided only if money is available, as the Labour Party seems to believe.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684158", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tuition Fees"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry.

In contrast, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition is cutting the budget for further education by &#163;1.1&#160;billion over the spending review period.

That is testament to the good work that is done by all those who work with those children. Decisions that are made early on in a child&#8217;s life greatly affect outcomes, and it is therefore imperative that those decisions are the right ones.</p><p>As a result of our inquiry, the committee agreed to focus a new inquiry on the decision-making processes that are involved in determining whether a child should be removed from the family home and taken into care, and&#8212;crucially&#8212;on identifying whether those processes are delivering the best outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>As part of the inquiry launch, I met a group of foster carers at Barnardo&#8217;s fostering and adoption service in Edinburgh. It was important that we began our inquiry as we intended to continue, by meeting not only people who know about the decision-making process but those who have direct experience of the results that it produces.</p><p>I will use the opportunity of today&#8217;s debate to cover some of the early&#8212;and, I believe, relevant&#8212;issues that are emerging from the evidence that we have already received, which points to inconsistencies in decision making, decision makers placing too great an emphasis on the cost of care, and delays in the system.</p><p>The committee is determined that the inquiry will hear from real people with direct experience of decision making on whether to take children into care, including foster carers, parents, social workers, staff in residential homes, children with experience of care, members of child protection committees and others.</p><p>We have already received a large number of written submissions in response to our call for evidence. Many complex issues are discussed in the submissions, and some of the evidence identifies existing barriers to good-quality early decision making.</p><p>It is clear from the submissions that there is a degree of inconsistency in decision making throughout the country and that thresholds for intervention vary among the professions and local authorities. We are told that there are shared common values, but not common standards of training, knowledge and practice. That may be particularly true in the area of neglect, perhaps partly because it is such a difficult thing to prove.</p><p>A related issue may be the difficulty that local authorities have in retaining competent, experienced and qualified staff in front-line childcare practice. There is, we are told, a clear lack of professional or financial advantage for social workers to remain in the field.</p><p>Invariably, as with everything else, a common theme in the evidence that we have received so far is resources. Many submissions have drawn the committee&#8217;s attention to the impact on decision making of the availability of placements and the cost of removal. I am sure that many people do not think of me as naive, and I do not want to sound naive, but&#8212;to be frank&#8212;why are the costs of taking a child into care a barrier? Is the focus too much on pounds as opposed to the bigger picture?</p><p>Curiously, none of the written evidence has provided any estimate of how much is spent on the overall child protection system, and to date we have not been able to ascertain whether current spend is adequate and providing value for money.</p><p>There are areas that the committee will consider further, particularly in light of the Scottish Government&#8217;s preventative spending agenda. I am clear that difficult decisions should be made in the best interests of the child and not because of a lack of resources. I know that that view is shared across the chamber, despite the difficulties that the point produces.</p><p>Another barrier that has been highlighted to the committee, and one that I suspect resonates with many people, is about the speed of decision making and the length of time that it can take for final decisions to be reached for a looked-after child. The reasons that are given for delays are numerous and, I am sure, perfectly legitimate in many cases. They include an overly optimistic approach taken by some professionals and children&#8217;s hearings towards reuniting children with their birth parents, decisions being made based on pressure from parents in preference to reports from professionals that recommend removal from the parental home, and general tensions between the rights of the parents and the rights of the child throughout the decision-making processes.</p><p>I am acutely aware that those are complex issues and that overly simplistic solutions will not suffice. Nevertheless there is clear evidence that many consider that it is currently taking too long for children to reach permanence. We have already identified some of the reasons for that.</p><p>Those are some of the main barriers that have been highlighted to the committee so far, and I expect others to be highlighted as the inquiry progresses. However, it is gratifying that, although barriers to progress were identified, we have so far received no evidence that suggests that the system is broken, even if improvement is required. That is encouraging and it shows that, although there are challenges to improve the system to ensure that it delivers in the interests of children, there is a willingness to look critically at how to improve outcomes.</p><p>The challenge for the Education and Culture Committee, MSPs, Government and all decision makers is to remain positive and constructive and to strive to improve the system.</p><p>Full implementation of getting it right for every child has been mentioned time and again as being key to improving the decision-making process in the question of whether to take a child into care. Of course, the Scottish Government has announced that it is looking to legislate on the GIRFEC approach.</p><p>I believe that the committee&#8217;s inquiry is, therefore, timely. It will shine a light on how decisions are made, whether they differ across the country and between agencies, and the extent to which resource constraints form part of the decision-making process. It will take place immediately prior to the Government introducing a bill that will touch on those issues. In my view, that allows for better scrutiny, which potentially means better legislation.</p><p>I hope that, down the line, the work of the Education and Culture Committee, the policies that are being pursued by the Government and the combined effort of local authorities, professionals, foster carers and adopters leads to more informed and clearer decision making and&#8212;what we ultimately all want to achieve&#8212;better outcomes for some of our most vulnerable children.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the past year and a half, the Education and Culture Committee has undertaken a considerable amount of work on issues such as kinship care, the early years and, in particular, the educational attainment of looked-after children.

His report covered a considerable number of areas, and the consultation contains 41 questions, many of which are split into multiple questions. The Carloway report is an important report with far-reaching recommendations on possible reforms of Scots criminal law and practice. As other members have done, I urge as many people as possible to submit their views to the Scottish Government before the consultation closes on 5 October.</p><p>Because of the breadth of the topics that the report covers, I will deal with only some of the issues that it raises. I start with recommendations on custody.</p><p>The recommendation to limit to 12 hours the maximum time for which a suspect can be held in detention prior to being charged or reported to the procurator fiscal is sensible, because it strikes the right balance between the various parties involved. It provides time for the police to do what they have to do, but also puts pressure on them to do it timeously. Question 6 of the consultation document asks whether there is scope for that time limit to be extended in exceptional circumstances. My view on that has not changed since the debate that we held on the Carloway report at the end of last year: there must be scope for the possibility of extension of the 12-hour maximum time limit, under certain circumstances. However, extensions must not become routine, so I ask the cabinet secretary to consider making extensions the subject of applications to a sheriff, or some similar process. I also support the necessity of having a senior police officer review the period of detention after six hours.</p><p>The proposals on corroboration have gained much attention. Most, if not all, members have focused on them. Lord Carloway&#8217;s report points out that the requirement for corroboration is not a requirement that every fact in a case must be proved by two witnesses. As is pointed out in the consultation document, the report states:</p><p>&#8220;Corroboration is about the number of witnesses available to prove facts. It is not about number of facts available to prove guilt.&#8221;</p><p>The report then provides a number of examples of corroboration. I will focus on one of those examples: DNA. Lord Carloway&#8217;s report points out that</p><p>&#8220;a forensic sample can be the only evidence required to identify a perpetrator, but there must be two &#8216;witnesses&#8217; to: (a) the finding of the sample at the crime scene; (b) the obtaining of a sample from the accused; and (c) the comparison between those two samples.&#8221;</p><p>For me, that is the perfect illustration of why change is required.

That example proves to me that the world of criminal evidence has moved on, but the rules of Scots criminal law have not moved with it. Instead, as other members have said, the system has had to find ways of working around the rules on corroboration by, for example, having two people speak to particular scientific evidence. A workaround is not, and should not be seen as, a cornerstone of Scots criminal law. Corroboration was an important part of ensuring fair trials in the past because it provided accused persons with protection from the possibility of an overzealous system of justice. However, the reasons for its introduction have passed into the history books and so has the justification for keeping it as part of our system of criminal law and practice in the 21st century.</p><p>That said, it is clear that we need to proceed with caution, because the proposal is a major change in how our criminal law operates. The cabinet secretary will need to provide Parliament with a bill that answers many legitimate questions about the recommendation, and will need to ensure that the change will in no way unbalance our criminal justice system.</p><p>Some members have argued that if corroboration goes, there must be accompanying changes in other parts of the system, such as in respect of majority verdicts. There has been a call for unanimous verdicts or qualified majority verdicts to be introduced at the same time as any change to corroboration.

Scotland has no say in how electricity transmission charges are enforced, because energy is reserved to Westminster. In an independent Scotland, our voice could carry real weight.

A fully independent Scotland would be better able to address the problems of Scottish society by aligning the welfare system not only with the taxation system, but with Scottish values.</p><p>Under the current arrangements, we have no choice but to accept what is done to us by a Government and political parties that we did not vote for, that we do not support and which we do not want. For example, the UK Government has closed the independent living fund to new entrants and has made the decision to wind it up completely in 2015. That fund is designed to help some of our most severely disabled people to live in the community rather than in residential care. There are 3,559 recipients of the independent living fund in Scotland&#8212;a really small number. Do we honestly believe that in an independent Scotland we could not afford to pay for 3,500 disabled people to live full and independent lives? I do not think that that is what we believe. Not only could we afford it, but we would want to afford it, because Scotland has always had a strong sense of community and fairness, and the people of Scotland would not vote into power a Government that made those sorts of cuts. Scotland did not vote for the Government that is making those cuts now, but we are lumbered with it.</p><p>Unlike Margaret Thatcher, I believe that there is such a thing as society. I also believe that the type of society that Scotland wants to flourish is one in which we all have a part to play.

We must make sure that the bill will allow the NLS to carry out its activities into the future, so we have to look at the limited powers of direction that are provided for in the bill in that context.

That is not to say that it will not bring some additional powers to the Scottish Parliament. The final version will be a marked improvement on what the UK Government originally proposed.</p><p>However, an opportunity seldom comes along in which public opinion, the majority view of the Parliament and the recommendations of a parliamentary committee are all in agreement and, at the same time, a legislative vehicle that would allow those aspirations to be fulfilled is going through the UK Parliament. Therefore, it is a source of regret that the UK parties have not stepped up to the mark and supported further devolution now. We know that they support jam tomorrow, just not today.</p><p>I will concentrate on what has been achieved in some of the policy areas that are addressed in the bill&#8212;particularly the provisions on the Supreme Court&#8212;through the good work of the Scotland Bill Committee and the negotiations between the UK and Scottish Governments and, therefore, why the Parliament should agree to the LCM.</p><p>Before I get on to the Supreme Court, I will mention the attempt to re-reserve Scottish procedures for insolvency.</p><p>The Scotland Bill Committee stated in its report:</p><p>&#8220;In the case of corporate insolvency, we do not consider that there is sufficiently clear evidence that makes the case for any change. In our view, it is not necessary to address any issues relating to different regimes for insolvency north and south of the border through reserving matters to the UK Government and Parliament&#8221;.</p><p>Unfortunately, not all of the committee supported that recommendation, with Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems supporting the re-reservation of powers to the UK. However, I am delighted that the UK Government accepted the view of the majority of the committee and has agreed to delete the re-reservation clause on insolvency.</p><p>Another area of concern to the committee was the clause on the implementation of international obligations, as others have mentioned. The committee recommended that the clause should be removed as it was unnecessary and had a potentially very wide application. Although David McLetchie for the Tories supported the UK having that power&#8212;against the evidence that the committee received&#8212;it is pleasing that the UK Government once again accepted the recommendation of the majority of the committee on the matter and will delete the clause.</p><p>Another of the welcome changes that are being made is an amendment that will extend an existing power in the Scotland Act 1998 potentially to protect all acts of the Scottish ministers from becoming retrospectively null should a court decide that the acts were outwith devolved competence. That is an important step forward in ending an anomaly that has the potential to cause major and potentially extremely expensive headaches for Scottish ministers.</p><p>Another change by the UK Government is its agreement to the committee recommendation to delete the clause in the Scotland Bill that would have allowed for the partial suspension of acts of the Scottish Parliament. The majority of the committee expressed serious concerns about that provision, agreeing that it had the potential to introduce significant unintended consequences and delay. Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems again dissented from the majority view, but both Governments agreed with the majority recommendation that the provision in the Scotland Act 1998 provides a clear incentive to ensure that all legislation that is introduced in the Scottish Parliament is prepared within competence, and that the clause is therefore unnecessary.</p><p>I turn to the Supreme Court. The issue produced a lot of controversy when it was first raised, but I am glad to say that, for the most part, it has been amicably resolved. Although there are still outstanding issues surrounding the Supreme Court and its impact on Scots law, a number of extremely important issues have been amicably dealt with.

That will end the Supreme Court&#8217;s ability to substitute its decision for that of the High Court. The point is extremely important for the maintenance of the role of the High Court within our legal system in Scotland, and I am happy to welcome the UK Government&#8217;s change of position on it.</p><p>A number of other recommendations and suggestions were accepted by the UK Government, including ensuring that the Lord Advocate and the Advocate General continue to have a power of reference to the Supreme Court, providing time limits for compatibility appeals to the Supreme Court, and allowing lower courts to refer compatibility issues to the High Court. Those changes and others show that the work of the Scotland Bill Committee and the efforts of the Scottish Government have improved the Scotland Bill by a considerable margin.</p><p>The main area that has been left unresolved with regard to the relationship between the High Court and the Supreme Court is that of certification. The committee spent a long time looking at that matter and made a considerable effort to look at both the oral and written evidence that we received on it. It is therefore disappointing that the UK Government has not agreed to accept our recommendation. It also rejected the view of the Lord Advocate and the Lord President on certification.</p><p>The Lord President wrote to the committee to express the view of the judges in the Court of Session, stating that they</p><p>&#8220;commend the proposal that the High Court should be brought into line with the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) and the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland by the requirement of certification by these intermediate appeal courts as a precondition of any criminal case being taken to the UK Supreme Court.&#8221;</p><p>Although it is unfortunate that the UK Government declined to accept those views in support of certification, I am pleased that the new scheme of operation will be subject to a review after three years.

In our stage 1 report, the committee welcomed the fact that the library&#8217;s governance arrangements are being updated and that its functions are being clearly set out in legislation.</p><p>However, although we recommended that the bill progress to stage 2, the committee&#8217;s report also set out members&#8217; concerns, in particular in relation to the ministerial power of direction. I will discuss that in more detail later.</p><p>I agree with the cabinet secretary that the overhaul of the library&#8217;s governance arrangements is long overdue; the current provisions have been in place for almost 90 years and allow&#8212;in theory, at least&#8212;the NLS board to have as many as 32 members. The present arrangements also allow for a considerable number of ex officio appointments to the board, including the committee&#8217;s very own Marco Biagi, who is MSP for Edinburgh Central.</p><p>Although there was support for the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals to modernise the library&#8217;s governance arrangements, there was also concern about the specifics of the Government&#8217;s approach; there was unanimous agreement among the organisations that provided oral evidence that the proposed lower limit for the board&#8212;seven members, including a chair&#8212;is too small. The current chair of the NLS considered that seven members would not be sufficient to cover the range of skills and stakeholder interests that are needed for an effective board.</p><p>The committee was persuaded by such concerns and, although we were not in a position to state what the optimum board size is, we sought an assurance from the Scottish Government that it would fully consult all relevant parties, in particular the NLS, before agreeing on a final number. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s willingness to raise the lower limit for the board, and the full discussions that will take place with the NLS.</p><p>I turn to the ministerial power of direction, which was the issue that caused the committee the greatest concern in the course of its scrutiny. In essence, the bill allows Scottish ministers to give the NLS directions on the exercise of certain of its functions. Those functions can be summarised as promoting collaboration between library and information services, and promoting diversity in the people who are accessing the collections. The bill&#8217;s policy memorandum helpfully sets out the areas in which the Government will not seek to direct the library, but it says very little about why a power of direction is to be retained in those two areas.</p><p>The committee therefore explored the issue in some depth. We were told by Scottish Government officials that, generally speaking, a ministerial power of direction in relation to public bodies is</p><p>&#8220;very much a last resort.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education and Culture Committee, 7 February 2012; c 693.]</p><p>For example, officials said that it would allow a minister to intervene in the event of serious operational or organisational failure. Although we can debate the merits of such an approach, the committee&#8217;s bugbear is that it is not obvious from the bill that the Government would be able to intervene in the manner that is described.</p><p>The cabinet secretary made the point&#8212;again, in general terms&#8212;that taxpayer-funded institutions must be accountable to the taxpayer for spending money wisely. However, she stressed clearly that any interventions in the NLS must not infringe the library&#8217;s curatorial responsibility and freedom. The cabinet secretary further explained that the power of direction could be used only in relation to the overall management of the NLS&#8212;another point that is not obvious from reading the bill.</p><p>To be fair, the committee acknowledged that it may be helpful to the cabinet secretary if she could retain the power of direction in the event of any future unforeseen circumstance. In reality, the power is unlikely to be used. However, given the questions around the issue, we sought a more detailed explanation as to why the Scottish Government justified the retention of the power of direction with reference to such broad issues when the bill focuses narrowly on promoting collaboration and diversity. The committee also asked how the bill could more accurately state how and when the power of direction could be used, which is where clarity and certainty are required. I therefore thank the cabinet secretary for her comments on the power of direction. I look forward to receiving her letter prior to stage 2 in order that we can get clarification and certainty to ensure that the committee is content with the proposals in the bill.</p><p>I am sure all members would agree that the National Library of Scotland is one of the country&#8217;s most important cultural resources. I am also sure that there would be unanimous support for maintaining free public access to its collections. There was nothing in the committee&#8217;s stage 1 scrutiny to suggest that that principle is under threat&#8212;indeed, both the Government and the NLS stressed their commitment to maintaining free public access. However, schedule 1 provides the NLS with a range of powers, including the power to make charges for access to its collections. That caused some disquiet at stage 1. For example, the Scottish Library and Information Council warned that proper procedures had to be put in place to ensure that charging for access will not be taken as a given.</p><p>While recognising those worries, the committee was comforted by the Scottish Government&#8217;s reassurance that the power to charge is subject to the library&#8217;s overarching function of making its collections publicly accessible. In other words, the power to charge could not jeopardise that function. The committee accepts that there are situations in which the NLS can legitimately seek payment for certain added-value services&#8212;for example, when there is an extra cost involved in providing a particular item. Some practical examples of that were given to the committee in evidence. Officials made it clear that, even in such circumstances, various safeguards would be in place to ensure that the library could not simply use the power unilaterally.</p><p>My final point relates to charging and overlaps with my earlier comments about the ministerial power of direction. The NLS&#8217;s power to charge, which is one of a number of powers that will be granted to it by the bill, can be used only in connection with the exercise of its functions. We therefore asked the cabinet secretary to clarify the relationship between the ministerial power of direction and the NLS&#8217;s general powers. The cabinet secretary confirmed that the library&#8217;s powers could, in principle, also be directed by Scottish ministers, albeit that that would be subject to restrictions. The Government stressed that a power of direction would be used only</p><p>&#8220;as a means of last resort&#8221;.</p><p>Again, however, the committee considered that the Government should provide clearer justification for its approach. I hope that the letter that is coming to the committee will do that.</p><p>The committee felt that greater clarity is required from the Government on how the various functions and powers that will be bestowed by the bill will mesh together and, in particular, how they will fit with the ministerial power of direction. I very much welcome the comments in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s opening speech, which provide additional reassurance on the scope and the practical impact of those powers. However, as I have said, I look forward to further clarification before stage 2.</p><p>The bill is a welcome and overdue reform of one of Scotland&#8217;s great national treasures. The committee therefore considers that Parliament should agree to the bill&#8217;s general principles. Assuming that it progresses to stage 2, we look forward to considering how the bill can be further improved to ensure that the library continues to flourish for decades to come.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Library of Scotland Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On behalf of the Education and Culture Committee, I make clear from the outset our unanimous support for the general principles of the National Library of Scotland Bill.

I did not necessarily agree with everything that she said, but her speech was a reasonable and reasoned argument of her point of view. I have to disagree with her opening remarks, though, about the timing of the debate. I share the cabinet secretary&#8217;s concern that the likely outcome is to stoke more anxiety among parents, pupils and teachers rather than to provide more information and reassurance. The proper place for the debate was the Education and Culture Committee. That is why I invited the various stakeholders to the committee, and I believe that that was the right thing to do.</p><p>Like Hugh Henry, let me give some quotes&#8212;I feel that it is going to be a morning of quotes, Presiding Officer. Let me start with:</p><p>&#8220;School staff at all levels are being demoralised by continual pressure for enormous change, unrealistic change, and change which is not being resourced ... There is no longer any belief among headteachers that what is demanded of schools can be achieved at any level of personal effort&#8221;.</p><p>I could go on, as I have much more in the same vein. That is not about the curriculum for excellence, though. It is about the introduction of the five-to-14 curriculum.</p><p>As we have seen over many years, every time there is change, particularly in education, there are genuine anxieties and fears at the point of change, so it is not unusual to see that this time. In fact, it would be unusual not to see anxiety and hear such comments at this time.

There were six of them: Auschwitz-Birkenau; Belzec; Chelmno; Majdanek; Sobibor and Treblinka. That is where they carried out their programme to exterminate the Jewish people.</p><p>Between 30 January 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power, and 8 May 1945&#8212;victory in Europe day&#8212;approximately 6&#160;million Jews were killed. We know that number so well from our history. It is quite unimaginable, but it meant the extermination of almost two out of every three Jews living in Europe and almost one Jew in three in the world at that time.</p><p>Of course, the Nazis killed not only Jews. Possibly as many as 200,000 Gypsies were murdered. Homosexual men, Communists, trade unionists and any people who opposed the regime were also slaughtered. Indeed, it has been estimated that the Nazis may have murdered as many as 15 million citizens, including millions of Slavs.</p><p>Faced with such evil, where do we begin when we wish to pick one example to highlight the extent of the horror? It is an impossible choice. However, I want us to think today about the euphemistically named Aktion T-4, the programme to murder physically and mentally disabled people.</p><p>Between September 1939 and August 1941, that programme of compulsory euthanasia resulted in more than 70,000 of the most defenceless people in society being murdered. It started with children and toddlers, who had to be reported to the authorities if they showed signs of physical or mental retardation. It moved on to adults: schizophrenics, epileptics and people with Down&#8217;s syndrome were all targets. They were deemed to be&#8212;I find the phrase almost unbelievable&#8212;&#8220;life unworthy of life&#8221;.</p><p>In the face of such inhumanity, what can we do today to make a difference? We can start by supporting the efforts of the Holocaust Educational Trust, which has been working since 1988 to educate young people about the Holocaust.</p><p>The Parliament heard last week from Dominic Bradley and Katie McKenna, who had been on a Holocaust Educational Trust trip to Auschwitz. I am delighted that the Minister for Learning, Science and Scotland&#8217;s Languages has pledged &#163;230,000 in 2012-13 to allow students to take part in the Holocaust Educational Trust&#8217;s lessons from Auschwitz programme. That will allow 380 pupils from Scottish schools and students from colleges to visit Auschwitz in the coming year.</p><p>One of the problems that the Holocaust Educational Trust faces in the 21st century is how to keep the memory of the Holocaust immediate and relevant as the number of witnesses diminishes. However, there are ways that we can pass the story on to future generations. I will give a personal example.</p><p>On 1 May 2011, I attended the Yom Hashoah event in Giffnock, the theme of which was the story of Irena Sendler, a Polish woman who rescued Jewish children from the Warsaw ghetto. I was lucky enough to hear Piotr Zettinger&#8212;a man whom Irena Sendler had saved&#8212;speak about his experiences.</p><p>More important, my daughter, who was 13 at the time, was with me. She has now heard at first hand the experiences of a survivor of the Holocaust. Her experience of listening to that direct witness of Nazi horror means that the story will be projected some 60 or 70 years&#8212;or more, I hope&#8212;into the future. She will be able to tell her children and grandchildren that she heard the story at first hand. I encourage as many members as possible to ensure that their children get the opportunity to carry the story forward.</p><p>I was delighted to learn of a project called gathering the voices, which has been produced by Glasgow Caledonian University. The project has involved recording the oral testimony of Holocaust survivors who moved to Scotland. The interviews and accompanying photographs will go online at the end of the month at the university&#8217;s spoken word archive, which will ensure that those voices will never fall silent.</p><p>That is important because anti-semitism, unfortunately, is still alive today&#8212;even here in Scotland. In a recent written question, I asked the Scottish Government about the number of religious hate crimes that were recorded in 2010-11. Out of 696 charges, 16 were derogatory to Judaism. On the face of it, that does not seem very many, but the Jewish community in Scotland is small, so unfortunately the figures convert to 2.5 charges per 1,000 members of Judaism in Scotland, which was the highest incidence per 1,000 for any religion. To put that in context, the next most targeted religion was Catholicism, with 0.5 charges per 1,000 members&#8212;a fifth of the number of charges involving crimes against the Jewish community.</p><p>We all need to speak out when we see discrimination or when we are aware of people being taunted for their race, religion, sexuality or disability. The Government can play its part by legislating against hate speech, but in the end, the responsibility for building a society in which prejudice is eliminated lies with each one of us. Each of us is responsible for the things that we say and the things that we do. In the end, morality is individual, not collective.</p><p>I started by quoting the poem by Pastor Niem&#246;ller in which he makes the point that, if you do not speak up publicly for others, there will be no one left to speak up for you. I end with a very different idea: that speaking up means challenging not just public figures and institutions but ourselves and those closest to us.</p><p>The writer Gitta Sereny wrote a book about her interviews with Franz Stangl when he was in prison in Dusseldorf. Stangl was the commandant of the Treblinka extermination camp. Ms Sereny also interviewed Stangl&#8217;s wife, and she asked her this question:</p><p>&#8220;Would you tell me ... what you think would have happened if at any time you had faced your husband with an absolute choice ... either you get out of this terrible thing or else the children and I will leave you.&#8221;</p><p>Frau Stangl told her:</p><p>&#8220;I believe that if I had ever confronted Paul with the alternatives: Treblinka or me ... he would in the final analysis have chosen me.&#8221;</p><p>After that interview, Gitta Sereny wrote:</p><p>&#8220;I felt strongly that this was the truth. I believe that Stangl&#8217;s love for his wife was greater than his ambition and greater than his fear. If she had commanded the courage and the moral conviction to force him to make a choice, it is true they might all have perished, but in the most fundamental sense, she would have saved him.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659544", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Holocaust Memorial Day 2012"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, 2012 is the 70th anniversary of the start of the programme of extermination of the Jews in the Birkenau chambers at Auschwitz.

Unlike in typical committee debates, the Education and Culture Committee has not published a report or agreed recommendations. The purpose of this afternoon&#8217;s debate is not to discuss at length the conclusions of an already-published report and to call on the Scottish Government to take a particular course of action. Rather, by seeking the views and experiences of all members, the committee invites the whole Parliament to inform its report, thereby building on the body of written and oral evidence that the committee has received during its inquiry.</p><p>Over many years there have been numerous attempts to get it right for looked-after children, in the shape of legislation, policy documents and initiatives to improve their educational attainment. However, we have to admit that, on the whole, we have not achieved what we set out to achieve. After 12 years of devolution, attainment levels for looked-after children remain significantly lower than attainment levels for other children. That begs the question: what is going wrong? What is, or is not, being done that leads to those poor figures? I will put it in starker terms: are we failing those children?</p><p>It was with those questions in mind that the Education and Culture Committee embarked on its inquiry last autumn. The inquiry has been conducted with an open mind, with members listening to the views of all those who have interests, from directors of education to teachers, and from trade unions to children&#8217;s charities.</p><p>The committee visited Glasgow to hear from people who work day in and day out with looked-after children, and who are trying hard to make a difference and spur children on to greater things. Tragically, too often the committee has heard stories of good progress being made over a long period only for that progress to be set back by events that are outwith the control of the school, the social work department or, indeed, the children themselves. It is clear that the problems are complex and multifaceted, and that they touch on areas that are beyond the scope of the inquiry. It is also clear that the questions that we are asking now have been asked for several years but have never properly been resolved.</p><p>I am under no illusions: it would be optimistic in the extreme to expect the committee to find a magic bullet. However, I hope that our report will provide an informed and considered contribution to the discussion that will cause all who are involved in the subject to reflect on how current practice is working and whether there are different ways of doing things.</p><p>The committee received written evidence from 32 groups and took oral evidence throughout November, which culminated in evidence from the then Minister for Children and Young People, Angela Constance. It is encouraging that many organisations suggested how improvements could be made. Five themes emerged from the evidence, which the committee has summarised for the purposes of the debate. I will briefly outline those key themes; I am sure that my committee colleagues will wish to develop them in their contributions. I will also ask various questions that have arisen from the inquiry and on which I would particularly welcome members&#8217; views.</p><p>The first theme that emerged was children&#8217;s readiness to learn&#8212;namely, in terms of the support that needs to be in place before a child or young person can engage with school learning. It is clear that many children face barriers to attainment before they even enter the school environment. The biggest challenge is in improving the educational attainment of children who are looked after in their own homes, as their circumstances can often be the most chaotic. In oral evidence, Claire Burns from the centre for excellence for looked-after children in Scotland told the committee that it is challenging to work on early literacy if there are huge issues around substance misuse, domestic violence or parents&#8217; own literacy levels.</p><p>In written evidence, Fife Council argued that children are ready to learn when they are emotionally stable, have secure attachments to key care givers, are free of threat and risk, attend school regularly and consistently, and are supported by key role models who value education and actively support learning.</p><p>All that shows clearly the need for the earliest-possible intervention. I will not dwell for too long on early intervention; I know that the merits of that approach are well understood and well supported throughout Parliament. In this case, early intervention may in practice mean greater focus on children who are looked after at home. The latest statistics show that attainment levels for that group are failing to improve, with the consequence that they are often being left behind by their peers. We must not allow that to continue.</p><p>Early intervention may therefore mean tougher and trickier decisions being taken earlier, and unacceptable conditions being spotted, challenged and responded to quickly. The committee would be interested to hear the views of other members on how we can ensure that looked-after children&#8212;particularly those who are looked after at home&#8212;are ready for school. How can better support be provided to parents to allow them to play a greater role in their child&#8217;s education? Do difficult questions have to be asked about whether, for some children, the home environment is the most conducive place in which to learn?</p><p>In asking those questions and discussing the best approach to supporting children who are looked after at home, we must not lose sight of the need to get it right for every child, whatever that takes. Otherwise, we will fail children who have already been let down by those who are closest to them.</p><p>The second theme to emerge was support at school. The committee heard evidence about issues that can hamper a child&#8217;s attainment at school. Some witnesses, such as CELCIS and the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, argued that poor attendance is currently the main barrier to attainment, and stressed the particularly poor attendance levels of children who are looked after at home.</p><p>However, the Association of Directors of Social Work took a different view: it believes a high number of exclusions to be the core cause of poor educational attainment. It made the point that the gap in attendance rates between all looked-after children and other children is relatively small, whereas the difference in the number of exclusions is vast. It reiterated the link between school exclusion, criminality and young people ending up in prison.</p><p>If we are to improve the educational attainment of looked-after children, we must consider all barriers to improvement. Therefore, the committee would be interested in hearing members&#8217; views on the link between exclusion and attainment, on the role that attendance levels play and, crucially, on the best means of ensuring that looked-after children are always inspired in school and encouraged to reach their full potential. On that point, some witnesses suggested that there should be a wider focus on looked-after children&#8217;s achievement, rather than simply their educational attainment. Members&#8217; thoughts on that point would also be appreciated.</p><p>The third theme to emerge was implementation of existing policy and legislation. As noted, there is a considerable amount of relevant policy, legislation and guidance on looked-after children. Much of the evidence suggests that existing policy and legislation is right, but also that it is complex, can lack coherence and, therefore, can be difficult to implement. The word &#8220;patchy&#8221; was used again and again in respect of implementation.</p><p>In written evidence, Fife Council argued that it is time to rationalise and simplify the processes for implementing the getting it right for every child programme, additional support for learning legislation and care regulations at national level. The council stated that it has done what it can to simplify those processes at local level. The committee also received some evidence of perceived conflicts between GIRFEC and ASL. However, that view was not shared by Education Scotland, which made it clear that GIRFEC and ASL are supportive of each other if they are implemented properly. The committee would be interested to hear from members about how the relevant legislation is working in their localities and, specifically, about how GIRFEC and ASL sit together in practice.</p><p>Two children&#8217;s bills will come before the Parliament in the not-too-distant future. How can we be certain that they will improve on current practice and decision making, and not just create another complex layer of law? I would be interested to hear the Minister for Children and Young People&#8217;s response on that question.</p><p>Another recurring theme in evidence was the need for greater joined-up working between relevant agencies. It disappoints me somewhat that joint working is still sometimes talked about as an aspiration. The need for joined-up working to improve the educational attainment of looked-after children&#8212;or any social problem&#8212;is hardly a new or innovative idea. There are plenty of examples of effective joined-up working in many parts of Scotland, but it is not clear that it happens across the board. Evidence that the committee received suggests that there are still silos out there.</p><p>Many witnesses stressed the importance of good working relationships and stated that they are vital for effective joint working. Other witnesses pointed to the importance of leadership and staff training and of challenging existing attitudes and cultures. Still others, including the Educational Institute of Scotland and Education Scotland, stated that information technology issues make sharing of records among agencies and among local authorities difficult, although others did not agree with that. Historically, there have also been cultural issues with looked-after children being seen as social work departments&#8217; problem.</p><p>I sincerely hope that the formal establishment of CELCIS will play a vital role in ensuring that effective joined-up working is practised throughout Scotland. We must ensure that, as CELCIS states in its aims, we</p><p>&#8220;enable the various settings and systems working with looked after children to collaborate more closely, providing a whole systems approach to improving the outcomes of looked after children.&#8221;</p><p>Before publishing its report, the committee would welcome members&#8217; input on that. What can be done to improve joined-up working? Is enough leadership being provided? Are there good local examples that are not widely known about? Those are crucial questions, to which we can surely bring a resolution.</p><p>The final theme to emerge in evidence was resources. The committee heard that lack of time, staff capacity and finance can act as barriers to joint working, the provision of learning support and the provision of stable placements. Evidence also suggests that capacity issues need to be considered. Examples include the significant shortage of available foster carers, and teachers in some schools having to deal with the specific needs of a number of looked-after children without compromising on the level of service that they provide to other children.</p><p>The committee also heard suggestions for changing resource allocations. For example, the EIS argued that schools&#8217; staffing formulae ought to be weighted according to the number of looked-after children in each school, while ADSW suggested that each local authority should have a dedicated looked-after children teaching and health resource and that all residential units should have a link education officer or teacher. Unison stressed the importance of sufficient support being available to learning staff. In oral evidence, Children 1st advocated pooling local authority budgets and cited the example of the early years fund in South Ayrshire, which has generated positive education and health outcomes. Again, in formulating its conclusions, the committee will welcome all members&#8217; views on all those interesting suggestions, in respect of the extent to which they are feasible in tough economic times and how they would work in practice in the communities that members represent.</p><p>Over the years, there have been many committee debates in this chamber, but I hope that this debate will be slightly different. The committee arrives in the chamber with no report or agenda, but simply with a body of evidence, some experience of the landscape and perhaps more questions now than it had when it started.</p><p>In concluding, I pay tribute to the many individuals across Scotland who strive day in and day out to improve looked-after children&#8217;s chances of achieving better results and thereby making it more likely that they will have a successful future. Committee members were privileged to meet some of those tireless individuals on their visit to Glasgow in November. I pay tribute to their work.</p><p>As I said at the outset, this committee debate is unusual in that there is no report to debate. Instead, we wanted to do things a bit differently and get the views of members from all across the chamber after we had gathered evidence but before we started to write our report. I know that, in its many committees and its plenary meetings, the Parliament is beginning to think about the parliamentary reform agenda, so perhaps we have made a start that others might wish to follow.</p><p>On an issue that is as important as the educational attainment of looked-after children, I am delighted that all members, regardless of whether they are on the Education and Culture Committee, regardless of their party allegiance and regardless of which area of Scotland they represent, will have the opportunity to contribute to and influence the committee&#8217;s final report. I look forward to hearing their contributions; committee members will listen carefully this afternoon. I hope that the debate will help to shape a robust, questioning, rigorous and informative report that will ultimately make a difference for looked-after children. Many of those children have already been failed. As corporate parents, let us not keep repeating that failure. Let us get it right for every looked-after child.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes that the Education and Culture Committee is undertaking an inquiry into the educational attainment of looked-after children and that, in order to inform its final report, the committee would welcome the views of all members on the key themes that have emerged in evidence.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is appropriate that we are holding this new style of committee debate at the outset of a new year.

I agree that many of the recommendations are closely linked and that it is sometimes difficult to choose one or another without unpicking the logic that flows through the report. However, it is not impossible to suggest changes or alterations to the recommendations.</p><p>Overall, it is a balanced package of recommendations within a thoughtful review. On page 5 of the executive summary, Lord Carloway says:</p><p>&#8220;The recommendations combine a range of new elements within well-established principles and procedures. Additional safeguards for the suspect are proposed together with greater police powers. Some obstacles to effective and efficient investigation are removed, but other measures are introduced to bolster the human rights of the suspect during that investigation.&#8221;</p><p>As stated in the report, the principal focus in relation to custody is to secure compliance with obligations under article 5, which encapsulates a person&#8217;s right to liberty. The proposed general right of arrest is straightforward. It is simple for suspects to understand, unlike the present situation. It clarifies matters and is probably a sensible suggestion.</p><p>Following on from that is the recommendation that the maximum time in custody without police charge should be 12 hours, with a review after six. That is, obviously, a change from the emergency legislation that we introduced last year, but one that has merit, given the evidence that is available to Lord Carloway. However, I wonder whether that should be an absolute maximum. The cabinet secretary should consider that matter and we should all consider it in detail as part of the on-going consultation after this debate. There may well be equally strong arguments for there being a small number of exceptions to the rule. Perhaps, on application to a sheriff, an extension to the 12 hours could be permitted. That should be debated in more detail when it comes to legislation.</p><p>I appreciate that there is a recommendation on investigative bail, but I think that an extension to custody could be considered as another option, in limited circumstances.</p><p>In relation to police investigations, the recommendations with regard to children and vulnerable adult suspects are very much to be welcomed. I know that a number of members have already mentioned that. In particular, defining a child as someone under the age of 18 is appropriate, as is the recommendation that people who are under the age of 16 should not be able to waive their right to a lawyer. Many of us find it almost impossible to believe that such a situation should exist at the moment, never mind in future. That would be a sensible change.</p><p>There is, however, a debate to be had about the recommendation that vulnerable adult suspects should be treated in the same way, in effect, as 16 to 17-year-olds&#8212;which is to say that they would be able to seek advice from an adult but would be able to waive their rights. The opposing suggestion is that they should be treated the same as under-16s and should not be able to waive their right to a lawyer. The debate involves complex and complicated issues. The phrase, &#8220;vulnerable adults&#8221;, might be only two words long, but it covers a wide range of people in difficult circumstances and with different levels of understanding and ability. We should be careful about vulnerable adults waiving their right to a lawyer. It may well be that, after careful consideration and discussion, we should conclude that vulnerable adult suspects should be treated the same as those who are under 16. I would be interested in seeing further evidence and in taking part in further discussion and debate on the matter.</p><p>Many speakers have talked about corroboration. The Carloway report says:</p><p>&#8220;Radical changes to the law of evidence are recommended so that the focus is directed away from the present task of gauging the quantity of testimony towards a more fruitful analysis of its relevance and an assessment of its quality.&#8221;</p><p>That is a very important sentence in the report and many of us feel that there is strong logic behind that recommendation.</p><p>I welcome Roderick Campbell&#8217;s comments about what corroboration means&#8212;there has been a general misunderstanding. Those members who have not yet read the full detail of the Carloway report should look at the examples given on fingerprint and DNA evidence and the fact that two witnesses have to speak to such evidence. There are strong arguments for changing that.</p><p>James Kelly and one or two others talked about rape or sexual offences cases and other cases. My view is that it would be logical to remove the need for corroboration either from all cases or from none. I would be dubious, to say the least, about trying to separate cases and saying that corroboration should be required in some but not in others. That would get us into serious difficulties and I am not sure that that is a wise course of action. Corroboration, as others have said, performed a strong role in the past&#8212;it certainly helped those who were falsely accused&#8212;but that was in a world before scientific evidence, before legal aid and before the statutory protections that now exist. We live in a post-Cadder world. Some of us may regret that, some not, but we clearly have to consider the effects of that judgment.</p><p>It is almost impossible to imagine a situation in which, in a serious case, the police would not fully investigate a crime, look for as much evidence as possible and have corroboration. We are talking about removing corroboration as a requirement, not saying that it should not be used at all. It is likely that it will exist in many cases. I note Rape Crisis Scotland&#8217;s view on the suspect&#8217;s right of silence in sexual assault cases. I do not agree with that view; I agree with Lord Carloway in keeping the provision that there is no adverse inference about a suspect remaining silent. There has been much talk of the impact on sexual offence cases, but, like many members, I urge caution, first about the numbers in the research, but also about the likelihood&#8212;the expectation, even&#8212;that there will be a lot more cases and a lot more convictions. Mr McLetchie and others point to the situation in England, where the conviction rate is almost the same as it is in Scotland. That is very important.</p><p>I shall conclude with two quick questions. One is about juries, which Mr McLetchie mentioned earlier. I think that 15 is the right number, I do not think that that is the question, but there is an argument&#8212;whether it is strong enough, I do not know&#8212;for moving from 8-7 verdicts to 9-6 or even 10-5. We must at least have the argument to decide whether, if we remove corroboration, we should make some sort of balancing change in the jury. We must debate that.</p><p>My final question is on similar fact evidence. Although not part of the Carloway review, the Scottish Law Commission will report early in 2012 and I would be interested to know the cabinet secretary&#8217;s opinion whether that change, if it comes, would be incorporated in any legislation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656451", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Law and Practice (Carloway Review)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I thank Lord Carloway and his team for a most detailed and thoughtful report.

Although the debate will bring out many of the shocking statistics on the plight of many looked-after children, without the work and dedication of many professionals, the future for many children would be a whole lot bleaker than it is. I also pay tribute to those who foster children because, in many cases, they provide the first stable and loving home that children have experienced.</p><p>Unfortunately, for many children, the dream of a stable and loving home is just that, as they have to cope with very difficult circumstances. Even the provision of a placement may not provide stability, as many children face multiple placements. Some children have had to experience as many as four, five or even six different placements before they find a permanent home. The knock-on effects of that are self-evident. The ability to form and maintain attachments is critical for a child&#8217;s development and repeated moves interfere with the possibility of a successful outcome for the child. I therefore very much welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to updating the training for professionals on that important point.</p><p>As the minister will be aware, the Education and Culture Committee has launched an inquiry into the educational attainment of looked-after children in Scotland. Only yesterday, we took our first oral evidence. Even at this early stage, it is clear from that evidence and from the written evidence that we have received that we should not lump together all categories of looked-after children. There are substantial differences in the outcomes achieved by children looked after in residential care, those looked after in foster homes and those looked after at home.</p><p>Although educational attainment is not the only measure or necessarily even the best measure of outcomes, it is a very important measure, and it is therefore alarming that the difference in educational attainment between all school leavers and looked-after children is not just a few percentage points. I point out to members a Scottish Parliament information centre briefing prepared for the Education and Culture Committee for its inquiry. The briefing contains many interesting statistics, but one particular table, which was referred to by Liz Smith and can be found on page 5, shows the percentage of pupils obtaining five or more qualifications at SCQF level 5 for 2009-10. For all leavers, the percentage is 55.9 per cent; for the most deprived children, it is 28.9 per cent; for children with additional support needs, it is 15.5 per cent; for children who are looked after away from home, it is 4.7 per cent; and for children who are looked after at home, it is 0.5 per cent. That is not just a small difference between children who are looked after by their parents and children who are looked after at home in different and difficult circumstances&#8212;it is a vast difference. I know that all parties are signed up to dealing with the problem, but the statistics give a stark reminder of the difficulty and challenge that we face.</p><p>The statistics on their own show how critical stability and permanence are for the life chances of looked-after children. The children who have that stability do much better than those who do not. The statistics also show that we cannot ignore the fact that children who are looked after at home have the worst outcomes of all looked-after children. They have the lowest qualification rates, the lowest rates of attendance at schools and so on&#8212;and so on.</p><p>Although it is understandable to want to keep families together&#8212;and desirable to keep families together&#8212;we must recognise that far too often there is a price to pay for that goal, a price that is paid by children through damaged life chances. It is therefore imperative that decisions are made as quickly as possible and that unnecessary delays are driven out of the system. I take the point made by Gil Paterson about the need to ensure that the work that needs to be done is done and that it is given the time that it needs.</p><p>The SCRA&#8217;s report findings show that we have still have a way to go in driving out unnecessary delays, however. Parenting assessments often take too long. It is particularly disappointing that when a child has been identified as at risk before birth, parenting assessments can still be the cause of extended delays in the process. I was particularly struck by the fact that in 45 per cent of the cases in the report&#8217;s sample, parents had already had a child removed, yet parental assessments were still causing delays. That is particularly difficult to understand when parents have previously had more than one child removed. What possible reason can there be for extended delays in such cases?</p><p>I agree with the view taken by the report that previous history is strongly indicative of a parent&#8217;s capacity to care safely for subsequent children. Of course we must review the evidence in such cases and ensure that we do not judge parents on past failings, but we must keep at the front of our minds the idea that the process should put the safety, stability and future life chances of the child at the centre of all we do. Being sensitive to the rights and needs of the parents is a priority, but the needs and rights of the parents do not trump the needs and rights of the child.</p><p>This week, we have seen a lot of comment in the press about the length of time it takes for a child to be adopted or to find some other form of permanence. The SCRA&#8217;s report sets out much of the argument about time delays and makes it clear that the majority of children face waiting times from first involvement to permanence of more than two years. Although the shortest time was only 10 and a half months, the longest was nearly 11 years. For most children, it took more than a year just for a decision to be taken about moving them towards permanence.</p><p>If we really believe in early intervention, we must accept the overwhelming evidence about the impact of the first two years of a child&#8217;s life on their future life chances&#8212;they make all the difference in the world. We must face up to the fact that to have such lengthy delays in the process can only damage the chances of a successful outcome for these children.</p><p>I do not underestimate the difficulties that are faced by those who work in the field and my remarks are not meant as a criticism of the work that they do as they grapple with incredibly difficult and complex problems, but we must realise that the evidence in many cases shows that almost any outcome is better than leaving a child to be looked after at home in difficult and demanding circumstances. Are we confident that the rules that we have in place regarding the rights of parents strike the right balance? Are we sure that the rules surrounding adoption are not too restrictive and off-putting?</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by putting on record my admiration for the work that is done by all those people who are involved in caring for looked-after children in Scotland.

Unskilled workers, skilled workers and staff came together to make sure that the work-in was a success. It was not about some of the difficulties and conflicts between many of the different unions that operated in the yards at that time, because they put those aside for the benefit of the yard and the people of Scotland.</p><p>Many names have been mentioned already, but I want to add to Stuart McMillan&#8217;s list. I will concentrate on a few guys from Govan who do not get the attention that they deserve. I am talking about people like Jimmy Cloughley, Davie Cooper and Sammy Gilmore&#8212;shop stewards from Govan division who were part of the UCS work-in. At this point, I must declare an interest&#8212;maybe I should have done so at the start of my speech&#8212;because the name that I want particularly to mention is that of my Uncle Davie, Davie Torrance, who is sitting in the gallery. David was a Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Staffs convener in Govan back in 1971, and I am as proud of him today as I was as a small boy back then. [Applause.]</p><p>The first communiqu&#233; that came out of the UCS work-in was:</p><p>&#8220;By the authority of the shop stewards&#8217; committee and the coordinating committee of the trade union movement of the Upper Clyde Shipyards, the workers hereby take over this yard.&#8221;</p><p>I think that that is a historic statement. Rather ominously, it went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;You will now take orders from the shop stewards only.&#8221;</p><p>Knowing my Uncle Davie, I can understand why it says that.</p><p>The timetable, some of which Hugh Henry mentioned, is worth repeating. In 1964, unemployment was rising and a Labour Government was elected in the UK. In 1965, public ownership of Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company was rejected by Harold Wilson. In 1966, yards across the UK began to shut. In 1967, the Geddes report came out. In 1968, as Hugh Henry said, UCS was created when the likes of Stephen&#8217;s, Fairfield&#8217;s, Connell&#8217;s, Brown&#8217;s and Yarrow&#8217;s came together.</p><p>A crucial point in the process came in January 1970, when Sir Edward Heath held a brainstorming session of his shadow cabinet at the Selsdon Park hotel. That meeting is important because it marked the first appearance of monetarism in the UK. Monetarism was broken by UCS in 1971-72 but, unfortunately, it reappeared later, in Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s time.</p><p>I know that time is short. There is so much that I would like to have said, but one thing that I will say is about the &#8220;lame duck&#8221; label that was attached to the yards. The yards were successful. Although there were difficulties, they were growing in strength. They had a strong order book that was worth &#163;90&#160;million and they were negotiating for another &#163;100 million-worth of orders. In each year from 1968 to 1972, they built more and more ships, so do not let anyone tell you that the industry was a lame duck.</p><p>The UCS demo was the first demo that I went on. It helped to shape my views of who we are and what we can achieve if we work together for the benefit of Scotland. UCS stands for Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, but for me, as for many people, it stands for &#8220;unity creates strength&#8221;, and that is a lesson for us all.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651342", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Upper Clyde Shipbuilders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join others in congratulating Hugh Henry on bringing this debate to Parliament.

I have been here for eight years, and the member has been here for 12, so we both know that it is not unusual for us to have debates before the start of a consultation, during a consultation, and after a consultation. Having the debate today does not seem entirely inappropriate. The Presiding Officer has spoken about suggestions for improving debates in the chamber and in committees, and it might be a good idea if committees sometimes initiated debates before beginning a consultation or writing a report. There are many ways of doing things; we do not necessarily have to await a final conclusion or report before speaking about a matter. What the member said was rather misguided.</p><p>I agree with what the report says about the realities. For those of us who do not wish to remain part of the UK state, the retention of the Supreme Court is, of course, anomalous. That is my starting point, and that is the SNP&#8217;s position. However, we are where we are. As has been said before by many people, we have to deal with the situation as we find it.</p><p>Richard Simpson concluded by saying that it would be terrible if Scots were denied justice because of delays or backlogs in Europe. Strasbourg seems good enough for the other 46 or 47 independent countries but, for some reason, it would not be good enough for Scotland. It is rather strange that every other independent jurisdiction and state accepts the role of the Strasbourg court, but the Labour Party thinks that we would be better off if we went to London.</p><p>I welcome some of the comments made by the review group in its report. Paragraph 44 says that the expert group thought that</p><p>&#8220;the existing statutory basis for bringing human rights issues to the Supreme Court was seriously flawed&#8212;&#8216;constitutionally inept&#8217; was the term used.&#8221;</p><p>Of course, the review group agrees.</p><p>I am surprised that some members today have ignored some of the comments in the review group&#8217;s report pointing out that there have been flaws and that there are anomalies&#8212;in fact, it talks about &#8220;striking&#8221; anomalies. I welcome the fact that Kezia Dugdale acknowledged that there was an anomaly that the review has attempted to address. However, I certainly did not agree with many of her other comments.</p><p>I thank Christine Grahame for reminding us of the history of this debate. The SNP did, indeed, argue against the creation of the Supreme Court.</p><p>We want a level playing field for our country and parity and fairness for our legal system. We certainly do not want uniformity; indeed, that is one of the dangers we face. On 8 February 2011, the then Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini told the Scotland Bill Committee:</p><p>&#8220;there is a real danger that we will have not just harmonisation of our criminal law on procedure and evidence but, indeed, a complete loss of identity for Scots law&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Scotland Bill Committee, 8 February 2011; c 479-80.]</p><p>Our concern is not just about giving parity to Scots law but about the danger of uniformity and loss of independent action in it. We ignore such critical matters at our peril.</p><p>Of course, it is not only the SNP that has opposed some of the issues that the Supreme Court has raised; many others, some of whom have already been quoted, have made clear their opposition, including Ian Smart, the former president of the Law Society, and Paul McBride QC, who has suggested that in law the First Minister is right on this issue. Moreover, in October 2010, Lord Hope, who sits on the Supreme Court himself, said:</p><p>&#8220;This has ... brought the Scottish criminal justice system under judicial scrutiny in London in a way that was not, to the best of my recollection, anticipated when the Scotland Bill was being examined in Parliament.&#8221;</p><p>We have consistently repeated that argument: the original intention has been changed by the introduction of the Supreme Court and its actions. Every member in the chamber, not just SNP members, should be concerned about that. Indeed, as Graeme Dey said, we should all be standing up for the independence of the Scottish legal system.</p><p>Finally, I remind the Liberal Democrats that, when the Parliament was having this debate back in 2004 and members were arguing over whether the Supreme Court&#8217;s introduction would be a good or bad thing and discussing the impacts that it might or might not have on Scots law, they were pressed on the question whether judges from another legal jurisdiction should have a say in Scots law. Margaret Smith, who I believe was their justice spokesperson at the time&#8212;if I am incorrect, I apologise&#8212;said in the chamber:</p><p>&#8220;if the supreme court is considering a peculiarly Scottish case, there is no question of Scottish judges being in the minority.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 29 January 2004; c 5312.]</p><p>That is exactly what has happened in every Scottish case that has come before the Supreme Court. Scottish judges are&#8212;and are always&#8212;in the minority. I ask that, in summing up, the Liberal Democrats withdraw that remark, apologise for it or change their position and support the proposal that, if the Supreme Court is to continue&#8212;which is obviously going to happen while we remain with the UK&#8212;Scottish judges should be in the majority when dealing with Scottish cases. That would certainly be helpful.</p><p>This is an important matter; it is not a matter for petty politics or personal abuse. I accept that there has been intemperate language both from our side and from members of other parties, but we must try to draw a line under the issue and deal with the matter in hand. It is important that we not only accept but defend the continuation of the independence of Scots law. If we lose that, we will lose one of the most precious things that we have and we will be cursed and damned by future generations for ever.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649724", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill (Supreme Court)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am rather surprised by that comment.

I thank the people of West Scotland for voting for the SNP in such large numbers on 5 May and for helping to re-elect me to Parliament for the third time. It is an honour and a privilege to serve as MSP for West Scotland, and I will do my utmost to ensure that I represent my region and its people to the best of my ability.</p><p>In approaching today&#8217;s debate, the biggest problem was that, because there are so many important issues needing discussed, it was difficult to know what to concentrate on. Like others, I will be able to touch on only a limited number today.</p><p>Let me start by highlighting some of the positives from the past four years. Some 130,000 pupils have been lifted out of crumbling school buildings, and 330 schools have been built or refurbished. Although that is an excellent record of achievement, there is still more to do. I am therefore especially pleased with the Government&#8217;s pledge to halve the number of pupils in crumbling schools during this parliamentary session. We now have the lowest-ever average primary class size, and a new legal limit of 25 has been set for primary 1.</p><p>Free higher education has been restored by ruling out up-front fees and abolishing Labour&#8217;s back-door fees. Twenty thousand modern apprenticeships are being delivered, which is a major increase on 2007, and there is a promise of 25,000 for each year in this coming session. Funding for college bursaries has reached a record &#163;89 million, supporting some 42,000 students. That is a proud record, although I am sure that the cabinet secretary would agree that it is merely a start on the work that has still to be done.</p><p>Those are only some of the achievements of the past four years but, in what are difficult times for the sector, it is worth remembering that progress has been made in a number of areas.</p><p>I turn to some of the challenges ahead, because it is clear that we are not short of critical issues to tackle. In 2001, the McCrone agreement led to stability in the school sector, but after 10 years it is right that we review the position in light of the prevailing circumstances. I will be interested to discover what emerges from the McCormac review. One of the major recent changes has been the introduction of curriculum for excellence, and one of the big questions for the review is whether the current arrangements are suited to the new reality.</p><p>I should have begun by declaring an interest: my daughter is just coming to the end of her first year of secondary school, which means that she is in the first group of pupils whose future will be partially decided and shaped by curriculum for excellence. In my experience, many parents across the country remain anxious about what the change means for their children. They want to be reassured that a coherent system is in place to support their children through their secondary schooling, and that curriculum for excellence will adequately prepare young people for what comes after school&#8212;whether that is employment, education or training.</p><p>Curriculum for excellence was a policy inherited from the previous Labour-Lib Dem Administration, but I know that the cabinet secretary will want to ensure that the system works in the best interests of our young people. If I may speak for a moment not as an MSP but as a parent, I would have to say that the cabinet secretary still has some way to go in allaying the concerns of parents about the new system. I would therefore be grateful if, in the summing up today, I could hear what plans are in place to maximise the information that parents get about curriculum for excellence as their children enter second year and have to decide what subjects to take on to examination. I was pleased to hear about the information that will be coming to teachers, but I would like to hear about what information will be going to parents. Many parents need to be reassured about their children&#8217;s future.</p><p>I am aware of the excellent work that is going on across the sector to implement curriculum for excellence, but we need to ensure that parents are kept fully informed of the facts and are confident in the progress being made. People in the sector are working hard, but parents are crucial to the future success of the system.</p><p>I turn to the issue of school closures. The subject remains at the top of the agenda nationally and in local communities across the country, and I make no apology for making a direct plea to the cabinet secretary about the proposal by East Renfrewshire Council to close Robslee primary school. The cabinet secretary will have on his desk at the moment requests from parents, pupils, members of the local community and local politicians, including myself, asking him to call in this decision. The proposal from the council is based on a flawed consultation, is without logic, and fails to provide any evidence about the crucial question of educational benefit&#8212;a subject that Mr Macintosh raised earlier. Many parents believe that councillors and officials had clearly made up their minds before the consultation was even launched, and that the council&#8217;s response to the consultation submissions ignored the weight of evidence against closure. The council&#8217;s arguments reached a new low when it argued that closure was a good idea because bigger class sizes were beneficial for pupils.</p><p>Much of the council&#8217;s argument is about cost savings. The cabinet secretary said:</p><p>&#8220;the act makes it clear that educational benefit must be the basis for closure decisions.

I have been a committee member for the past two years of this session of the Parliament. The clerks made a great team; they served the Justice Committee very well.</p><p>I am absolutely delighted to be taking part in this final justice debate in this session of the Parliament. As other members have said, this is the final debate of the parliamentary session. The debate is an important one, dealing as it does with an ancient tenet of Scots law. I am slightly disappointed&#8212;I had hoped to be the first member to mention tholed assize, but Robert Brown got in first. There you go. I will stick to double jeopardy, given that he used that other phrase.</p><p>Before I turn to the meat of the issue, I join other members in commenting on Bill Aitken&#8217;s convenership of the Justice Committee. Bill Aitken has been a top-class servant of the Parliament over the past 12 years and a top-class servant of the Justice Committee over the past four years. We wish him well in his retirement. I will miss in particular our jousting on BBC Radio Scotland of a morning or evening. Bill and I suffer from the same problem of living relatively close to the BBC headquarters&#8212;indeed, it may be no problem, but a useful thing. Our proximity to the BBC meant that our parties often called upon us to be available to put forward our respective points of view. I wish Bill very well in whatever he chooses to do in future.</p><p>One thing that has been slightly overlooked in the debate on the bill is that, although the provisions will allow trials to take place for a second time, we are putting a very important rule and safeguard of Scots law&#8212;double jeopardy&#8212;on a statutory footing for the first time. It is critically important that we all understand that. Double jeopardy does, of course, give a solid line of defence to those who have been tried and acquitted. As other members have said, there are some underlying fundamental reasons why we have had to make this change in the law.</p><p>I have not always agreed with Paul McBride QC, but he got it right when he said:</p><p>&#8220;If one thinks of rape cases involving children, rape cases involving adults, horrific murder cases, and new evidence of a compelling nature comes to light that wasn&#8217;t available at the trial that demonstrates beyond any question the person is guilty, is it right as a society to say that persons should go free?</p><p>For me, that sums up why we are here today to make this change. It cannot be right that society knows that a person is guilty but allows that person to go free. For that reason, it is absolutely correct that we make the change.</p><p>However, we must be exceptionally careful when making such a change. Many have argued that it may be a step too far. Given that there is consensus across the chamber for the change, we must accompany it with rigorous safeguards to ensure that people are rightly protected. Those safeguards are in place in the bill at stage 3. As Professor Christopher Gane said to the Justice Committee in evidence, people should not be found &#8220;guilty by attrition&#8221;&#8212;a phrase that sums up some of the risks in making such changes. However, I am sure that that will not happen in this case.</p><p>The strength of our committee system emerged strongly during consideration of the bill. In the bill as introduced, the offences to which it applied were listed in schedule 1. The Justice Committee disagreed with that approach and thought that there were better, more logical ways of deciding which cases should be dealt with. I am glad that the Government agreed with that recommendation and that the cases to which the bill will apply are now defined as cases that were originally tried in the High Court. That is a much more logical way of treating the issue.</p><p>The argument about retrospectivity always seemed slightly odd to me. Is the legislation retrospective? If new evidence comes forward today, tomorrow, next month or next year, surely it is new evidence, even if it relates to old cases. In my view, it would be unjust to ignore that evidence and, effectively, to say that because a case took place a number of years ago&#8212;or, as some members have said, literally a week before the legislation came into effect&#8212;the legislation should not apply. I have never accepted that argument. The argument about retrospective application was a slight red herring in our discussions, but it led to a detailed debate about the issue, in which we came to the right conclusion.</p><p>My concluding remarks concern not the technical aspects of the bill but the reasons why we should be here today. There are five such reasons. First, other members have spoken about the scientific and technical advances that have been made, which may allow DNA or other compelling evidence to come forward. Secondly, there is a moral principle, which we often take for granted, to what we do. It is undeniable that justice should be brought to bear on those who are guilty of serious crimes.</p><p>The third reason is public perception and confidence. Surely our justice system comes close to being undermined if public confidence is lost because people walk free, although we have the evidence to prove that they are clearly guilty, or, as members such as Richard Baker have said, because people boast about their previous crimes and having got away with them. The bill is an important measure to address that issue.</p><p>The fourth reason is consistency. It is and has always been right that people should have a right of appeal against a sentence, if new evidence comes to light. It seems fair and consistent that, if new evidence comes to light on the other side, we should be able to deal with that issue, too.</p><p>The final reason that I want to mention is the most important one of all. The bill provides justice for victims and victims&#8217; families. Irrespective of all the debates that we have had, that is the fundamental reason why this is the right change to make to Scots law. It gives me great pleasure to support the bill today. The bill will make an important change. It will seldom be used, but when it is, it will be very important to the families, to the victims and for the credibility of our legal system.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647375", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank in particular the Justice Committee clerks for their assistance, advice and support on the bill and over the past four years.

I am sure that Rhoda Grant is disappointed that some bits were removed, but I hope that she appreciates that the committee did its best to strike the right balance between the rights of all the individuals who are involved in such dreadful circumstances. I am sure that she knows that there was certainly no intention among committee members to side with the perpetrator in any way, shape or form in our views on the legal aid provision that was removed at stage 2.</p><p>I agree very much with previous speakers. As Bill Aitken said, in the latest year for which we have figures&#8212;2009-10&#8212;51,926 incidents of domestic abuse were recorded. That statistic is horrific on its own but, as we all know, such incidents are very much underreported&#8212;the actual number is much higher. I say that with confidence because, as the violence reduction unit has pointed out, it takes on average approximately 35 incidents of abuse before a victim reports the matter to the police. That shows that much domestic violence that is going on is not being reported, so we are&#8212;at least formally&#8212;unaware of it. There is no doubt that, although 51,926 is a tremendously awful figure, it shows only some of the problems that we face in our society.</p><p>Those of us who were at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association event at lunch time saw some of the difficulties with gender-based violence in Malawi. To be frank, although the situation is dreadful here&#8212;I do not underplay it&#8212;we can be thankful that we do not face the difficulties that some countries around the world face.</p><p>The bill has been debated widely at the Justice Committee and in the chamber. I will not spend time on the technicalities, the finances, the legalities and all that, which many other members have mentioned and which the committee dealt with in depth. I will return to the principle behind why we are here in the first place&#8212;why Rhoda Grant introduced her worthwhile bill. It relates to the figures on domestic abuse. We know from evidence from the violence reduction unit on the British Medical Association board of science report of 2007 that about 30 per cent of domestic abuse cases start during pregnancy. When I first read that figure, I was utterly appalled&#8212;as I am sure other members were&#8212;that pregnancy was somehow involved in the beginnings of domestic abuse. Unfortunately, pregnant women who experience domestic abuse are twice as likely to have a miscarriage. That shows the seriousness of the issue, which involves not just violence against an individual but the repercussions of that violence.</p><p>It is shocking that nearly 40 per cent of all domestic abuse cases occur on a Saturday or a Sunday. We have had many debates and we have sometimes disagreed about how we tackle the problem of alcohol abuse in our society, but I hope that the fact that 40 per cent of cases occur at weekends will make us think that it is legitimate to link alcohol and domestic abuse. In the next parliamentary session, we must tackle the problem at its source, which means dealing with the alcohol abuse problem that unfortunately exists in some of our communities.</p><p>I will finish with one telling statistic. As Richard Baker said, the Christmas holidays are a particularly difficult time&#8212;they are a peak time for domestic abuse. On average, 142 domestic abuse cases occur each day during the year. Between Christmas eve and 1 January, the figure is 183 per day. On 1 January 2010, 395 cases of domestic abuse occurred. The connection between alcohol and domestic abuse is clear, and we will have to tackle it in some depth in the next session.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646830", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin where Robert Brown left off by saying how much I admire the work that Rhoda Grant has undertaken on the bill.

Instead, I took the time to look at the material and the evidence and to speak to local residents and, of course, the developers. However, after doing that, and with a growing sense of unease, I have come to the conclusion that the proposal does not merit support. For a start, it is far too big. As Jackson Carlaw has said, it will cover 29 hectares, or about 29 Murrayfield rugby pitches. In addition, the plant will have a substantial visual impact. For example, the chimneys will be 65m high&#8212;or, in old money, roughly 200ft&#8212;in an area where there are no buildings.</p><p>One of the primary claimed benefits of the plant is that it will produce energy for the national grid. However, there is no mention of how that energy will get to the grid, other than the throwaway reference to underground cables or pylons that Jackson Carlaw highlighted. Given that underground cables are the expensive option, it is obvious that overhead pylons will be used. So, in addition to the 29 hectare incinerator and the 200ft-high chimneys, local residents will have enormous electricity pylons marching across their skyline.</p><p>Even if it was thought that such an enormous incinerator plant was a good idea, the question remains why this particular site is being considered. Potential suitable sites for waste management activities have been laid down. They include &#8220;Industrial areas&#8221;. Loganswell is a greenfield site. Another is</p><p>&#8220;Degraded, contaminated or derelict land&#8221;.</p><p>Loganswell is none of those. A further example is</p><p>&#8220;Working and worked out quarries&#8221;.</p><p>The site is rough grazing land. &#8220;Existing waste management sites&#8221; does not apply, nor does</p><p>&#8220;buildings that can be easily adapted&#8221;.</p><p>Another option is</p><p>&#8220;Sites that have the potential to maximise ... the re-use of waste heat through co-location with potential heat users&#8221;.</p><p>There is nothing anywhere near the site that could use the waste heat, and talk of possible greenhouses does not really overcome the problem. The final option is</p><p>&#8220;Sites accessible to railways, waterways or the trunk and principal road network junctions.&#8221;</p><p>There are no waterways or railways in the area. It is close to the M77, although about a mile away from the nearest junction. The Loganswell site fails on most criteria for what constitutes a suitable site.</p><p>I want to look in more detail at the transport issue. It is proposed that about 1.5 million tonnes of rubbish will be transported to the site every year. The developers believe that that will have a minimal effect on the road network, as the material is already being moved around. However, the big difference is that the transportation of that 1.5 million tonnes of waste is currently spread across the whole of the road network. The proposal will concentrate all of it on the M77, and near Newton Mearns in particular.</p><p>There has been some disagreement about the total number of lorries that will be needed to transport the waste. I listened with interest to Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s calculations, but even if we accept that all the lorries used will be the maximum size available, that will still mean a 44-tonne lorry laden with around 29 tonnes of waste arriving at the site every three to 10 minutes, depending on who is correct about the number of lorries required. However, it seems unlikely that 100 per cent of the lorries will be that size; at least some of them will be around the most common size, which is the 26-tonne lorry, with a capacity of around 10 tonnes.</p><p>Anyone who knows the M77 knows that it can get extremely busy for considerable periods of the day, and so they cannot envisage that all those additional lorries will have anything other than a negative impact on an already busy road. The developers have acknowledged that issue and have said that they will timetable lorry journeys away from peak times. That is to be welcomed, but it means that at other times of the day and night there will be an even greater concentration of lorries than if they were evenly spread.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s zero waste plan prioritises the collection of separated waste rather than incinerating that which can be recycled. SEPA has stated that it believes that only about 5 per cent of the total waste will be recycled, which is a woeful figure. Some might even say that this type of plan discourages recycling and encourages the continuation of an attitude that it is okay to throw everything away. That is not the way that we should be going. It is a retrograde step.</p><p>Richard Lochhead, the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, in a speech to Parliament, said:</p><p>&#8220;In our approach to waste, we are determined to remain mindful of the wider climate change challenge and our energy policies. That is why the Government is opposed to large, inefficient energy-from-waste plants. Such plants could easily become white elephants and drain public funds. They require excessive transportation of waste and could crowd out recycling and waste prevention.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 24 January 2008; c 5494.]</p><p>I agree. The proposal is too big and it is at the wrong site. There are clearly enormous issues to do with transport, not to mention the untried nature of the technology.

It seemed anomalous to many of us that the requirement to show a course of conduct before a non-harassment order could be granted had been removed in criminal cases but that that had not been done in civil proceedings involving domestic abuse. It is entirely reasonable for such an amendment to be made. Our support for that change was unanimous.</p><p>There was also unanimous support for section 3, which, if the bill were enacted, would relieve victims of domestic abuse of the burden of taking forward any proceedings, because the criminal justice system would take over that responsibility.

That leaves the problem of how we define &#8220;domestic&#8221;. Clearly, we could rest on other definitions in existing guidance or the common law, as well as the dictionary definition, which John Lamont mentioned.

I was going to quote paragraph 52 of the committee's report, but Bill Butler has already done so. The fact that there are a wide variety of views on the bill, especially on this issue, has already been mentioned. In effect, there were three options before the committee: to agree to the deduction of a fixed amount for living expenses and on what the figure should be; to reject the idea completely in favour of negotiation between the parties, which is the status quo; or to support the idea of a fixed figure but with some flexibility&#8212;in other words, a rebuttable presumption.</p><p>Although some members of the committee thought that the correct approach was to have a fixed figure, others thought that that would result in an unfair outcome in some cases, where there would be either overcompensation or undercompensation. The hypothetical scaffolder and his family whom Robert Brown mentioned were referred to by Simpson &amp; Marwick, but that was only one example of possible undercompensation or overcompensation.<place-holder colnum=\"31553\"/></p><p>Despite concerns that it could undermine the purpose of the fixed figure, and after hearing the evidence and debating the point at length, the committee agreed that the suggestion of a fixed figure with a rebuttable presumption is perhaps the best solution, although it requires some detailed work by Bill Butler and the Government. However, recognising the force of the argument that such a proposal, if unfettered, could lead to little improvement on the current position, the committee accepted that a rebuttable presumption should be used only to deal with cases in which 25 per cent is clearly not the current figure for the deduction of living expenses. Although the drafting of such an amendment may be difficult, that seems to the committee to be the best way forward. Resolution of the problem is crucial if I am to support the bill after stage 1.</p><p>It was difficult to reach a conclusion on the proposed exclusion of mental disorder in section 4(3)(b). I fully appreciate the reasons why Bill Butler thought that it was appropriate and necessary to include the provision in the bill. However, given the complexity of the issue and the requirement for this area of law to be examined at much greater length, I must support the committee's conclusion that section 4(3)(b) should be removed at stage 2. As paragraph 127 of the committee report states, the sensible way forward is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to leave the law in this area essentially unchanged until there is either a decisive Inner House ruling on the matter or until separate legislation on damages for psychiatric injury can address the issue in a more considered and comprehensive way.\"</p><p>I realise that some people will be disappointed by that conclusion, but I think that it is correct at this time.</p><p>Whether the partner's income should be wholly or partially excluded from any calculation was an issue of contention for some witnesses and in some of the evidence that was given to the committee, but there was a fair degree of unanimity in the committee that the correct way forward was to disregard the surviving partner's income in any calculation. I thought that it was a fairly straightforward argument that, if a known amount is lost due to an unlawful death, that amount should be compensated for and the partner's income is irrelevant.

That is nonsense. The power remains and, prior to the past week, the UK Government had never stated that the power was lost.

The UK Government made that absolutely clear in its budget documents.</p><p>In 2007, the UK budget document, on page 211, talked about the SVR, its use and the Government's view on that. In 2008, the budget document, on page 113, made the point that the SVR was available and talked about how it could be used. In 2009, on page 156, the budget document stated that the SVR existed and talked about how it could be used. In 2010, on page 123, the budget document mentioned it again.

Margaret Smith stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"if the supreme court is considering a peculiarly Scottish case, there is no question of Scottish judges being in the minority.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2004-01-29.5311.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 29 January 2004; c 5300.]</citation></p><p>That has been proved to be completely wrong and Margaret Smith should withdraw that wholly inaccurate statement.</p><p>Underlying all the difficulties is the relationship between the ECHR and Scottish legislation.

If that court rules against our procedures, that should be a matter for the Parliament to deal with, after due consideration. However, we are in the invidious position of having to suffer at the hands of the UK Supreme Court while we have it embedded into our rules that all legislation must be ECHR compliant.

It is fair to say that administrative justice is a key but fragmented part of our justice system. Over the years, a number of seminal reports&#8212;others have mentioned the Franks, Leggatt and Philip reports&#8212;have looked at creating a coherent system that is fair, accessible, timely, efficient and inexpensive to use. However, what we have thus far is the result of the ad hoc development of tribunals over many decades.</p><p>Current oversight of the tribunal system is provided by the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, the Scottish committee of which is responsible for promoting good practice across all the tribunals operating in Scotland, regardless of whether they deal with reserved or devolved issues. It draws its membership from lawyers, academics, ombudsmen and lay people.</p><p>Most tribunals have been created by individual pieces of primary legislation, resulting in a complex variety of administrative arrangements that provide little coherence between tribunals.</p><p>The administrative justice steering group was tasked with reviewing the administrative justice system in Scotland, taking into account the impact of UK-wide reforms. Its interim report, \"Options for the Future Administration and Supervision of Tribunals in Scotland\", assessed the current system against the recommendations of the report \"Tribunals for Users: One System, One Service\". The steering group's recommendations are summarised under three headings: \"Independent and impartial processes\", \"An independent and skilled judiciary\" and \"A coherent system\".</p><p>Much of the thinking that underlies the interim report can be traced back to previous reports that examined tribunals. In 1957, the Franks committee identified the key characteristics of tribunals as <place-holder colnum=\"29202\"/> openness, fairness and impartiality, which continue to be the watchwords of tribunals today. The desire for those characteristics to remain at the heart of tribunals is reflected in the administrative justice steering group's report and recommendations.</p><p>The recommendations must be examined in the Scottish context. Bearing that in mind, it is clear that in seeking to create a coherent Scottish tribunal system a number of baseline points need to be established. First, we must always have at the front of our thinking the distinctiveness of the Scottish legal system and the requirement that tribunals fit within the system's overarching principles.</p><p>Secondly, it is necessary that tribunals, like other parts of the justice system, are able to act independently. I very much agree with what Robert Brown said in that regard.</p><p>Thirdly, although tribunals are part of the overall justice system, it is crucial that their distinctiveness is maintained. The differences between tribunals and the ordinary civil courts, and the benefits that those differences bring to service users, must be acknowledged and safeguarded. Tribunals are only one part of our administrative justice system and are intended to provide a more accessible and user-friendly forum for resolving disputes than is offered by the courts. Although many people might find the prospect of appearing before a tribunal daunting, I think that people usually find that more acceptable than having to go to court would be. It is therefore essential that we have an efficient and effective tribunal system that works properly for the people who need to use it.</p><p>With those principles in mind, the administrative justice steering group put forward five options for the future shape of tribunals in Scotland. Option 1 is to retain the status quo, but I do not think that many people support such an approach. Option 2 is to improve the mechanisms for co-operation between tribunals that are part of the Tribunals Service and devolved Scottish tribunals. Option 3 is to bring all Scottish tribunals within the remit of the Tribunals Service. Options 4 and 5, which I think are the only serious options are, respectively, to create a Scottish tribunals service to support all Scottish tribunals and to create a Scottish tribunals service to support all tribunals in Scotland, including those that are currently administered by the Tribunals Service.</p><p>After examining the five options, the Scottish committee of the administrative justice steering group concluded that the best option for users in Scotland would be a Scottish tribunals service that supported all tribunals that operate in Scotland. I listened with interest when Robert Brown said that he was not sure whether option 4 or option 5 would be the better one, but I think that it is self-<place-holder colnum=\"29203\"/> evident that option 5 would be better for the future of tribunals in Scotland, because it would provide the most clear-cut and efficient way of administering that part of our justice system. It would create a system that better met best-practice principles of justice by separating the administrative support for tribunals from the related policy area&#8212;that relates to a main criticism of the current arrangements.</p><p>In addition, it is clear that there are efficiencies to be gained from public sector simplification. The cost of cases varies widely between different tribunals, in ways that do not reflect the complexity of cases. Efficiencies can be generated through co-location, the sharing of information technology systems and best practice, and better governance and performance of corporate functions such as finance and contract management.</p><p>It has been estimated that in the first year of operation of a Scottish tribunals service, savings could be in the region of &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000. Such savings on the current arrangements would be welcome, and should make us stop and think about the lessons that we can draw from and the impact on the public purse of changes to administrative and support services.</p><p>In that context, I make a wider point about what we can learn from the proposed changes to the tribunal system. At a time when we face unprecedented cuts to our budget, we need to look at all areas of expenditure, including the overall structure of the public sector. That is widely acknowledged. If it is true to say that the tribunal system in Scotland grew up over a long time and in an ad hoc fashion, it is equally true to say that the public sector has developed in a somewhat similar fashion. That is not a criticism but a statement of fact. No one ever sat down and designed the Scottish public sector in a co-ordinated and coherent fashion; the sector merely developed and changed at different times and in different ways.</p><p>That is clear when we consider something as simple&#8212;although often sensitive&#8212;as the huge variety of boundaries that operate in different parts of the public sector. Why do the boundaries of councils, health boards and the emergency services not line up? Do we need 32 councils, 14 health boards, eight police forces and eight fire and rescue services to cover a population of 5 million? If we can see the logic in bringing together the administration of tribunals in Scotland, what is the argument for having separate administration and support services, not just for eight police forces and eight fire brigades, but for the police and fire services? Should we not be considering the model that is proposed for the Scottish tribunals service as a possible option for a united <place-holder colnum=\"29204\"/> support service that would cover the police, fire and ambulance services, for example?</p><p>Any changes that are proposed in the coming months and years need to be considered with two things in mind: whether they would make the service more effective and efficient, and whether they would protect front-line services. I think that they will, in relation to the Scottish tribunals service, but if the answer to those questions in relation to the wider public sector is also yes, perhaps it is time that we made those changes. If the unification of support services saves money and means that we keep front-line firefighters, police officers and paramedics in place, that is what we should do. The lead that is being shown in relation to the Scottish tribunals service will have implications beyond simply the future administration of tribunals.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21015188", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunal System Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a welcome debate on what is sometimes a forgotten but nonetheless important part of the Scottish justice system.

I am not clear why there should be an imbalance in the procedures for the appointment of the members. The effect of amendment 172 would be that the Scottish ministers would have to consult the Lord Justice General on the appointment of lay members, rather than to seek the Lord Justice General's approval of those lay members.

The process of reform and renewal of our court system has already seen the Bonomy report on reform of the High Courts, and the McInnes review of summary justice. The Bowen report adds to the progress that has been made and moves in the direction of travel that was established by those earlier reports.</p><p>Lord Bonomy's report attempted to tackle the so-called churn in High Court cases and pointed the way towards creating the circumstances for greater efficiency and greater certainty in dealing with cases. The main change that the Bonomy report recommended was the introduction of preliminary hearings, to ensure that both the Crown and the defence were ready to proceed to trial. Although the situation is not identical in the sheriff courts, there are similarities between the sheriff courts and the High Court in relation to citing of witnesses to trials that do not proceed, and the administrative effort and cost, as well as the inconvenience to witnesses, that result from that. One of the most interesting statistics in Sheriff Principal Bowen's report is that 96 per cent of respondents to a questionnaire that was directed at practitioners believe that unnecessary citation of witnesses is a problem, despite the <place-holder colnum=\"27755\"/> existence and purpose of first diets in sheriff and jury procedure.</p><p>Unnecessary citation inconveniences not only witnesses, but the police and members of the forensic services. We cannot afford to waste their time on unnecessary journeys to court. Sheriff Principal Bowen gives examples of problems in straightforward cases that should, on the face of it, be disposed of quickly. However, there is often little incentive for that to happen.</p><p>As members have said, the report details a number of difficulties with communication, not only between the Crown and the defence but, sometimes, between the defence and the accused. For example, in some cases, the defence experiences extreme difficulty in obtaining instructions from the accused. The problem is not limited to communication; it also creates some of the reasons why witnesses are unnecessarily cited to attend court.</p><p>The report covers a range of issues and highlights a number of problems in the system. I am sure that other members will address them in their speeches&#8212;there is insufficient time for me to go through all of them.</p><p>I wish to deal with some of the proposals for improving the situation. Following the reform of the High Court, there is a recommendation that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"cases brought by way of indictment in the Sheriff Court should not involve fixing a trial diet when the indictment is served. Cases should be indicted to a First Diet, and the court will allocate the case to a trial sitting once it is satisfied that all outstanding issues have been resolved at the First Diet.\"</p><p>That recommendation is sensible and is to be welcomed. The introduction of greater certainty to the system can only be a positive move and helpful to everyone involved.</p><p>I also welcome the proposal to formalise best practice by way of compulsory business meetings before an indictment is served. Early communication between the Crown and the defence is another sensible measure that should lead to a reduction in delays to trials. I am sure that many members are aware that that is not unusual to many people who operate in the system, but such early communication does not always happen, unfortunately, and that leads to delays.</p><p>I want to highlight the issue of TV links: that is dealt with in chapter 9 of the report, which is relatively short. If we consider what causes unnecessary delays and costs in our system, it is clear that one of the obvious problems is transportation of prisoners to and from courts. The introduction of a TV link between Barlinnie prison and Glasgow sheriff court in August 2003 and its extension to other courts that are served by <place-holder colnum=\"27756\"/> Barlinnie prison after the review of October 2004 was supposed to provide part of the solution to those delays and costs. However, figures that are highlighted in the report show that the use of TV links has fallen from about 15 a month to about three a month, which is evidence that such technology is not being used as it should be or as it was intended to be used. The use of TV links between prisons and courts should be expanding rather than contracting, because such technology has a number of potential benefits, including the protection of witnesses and victims in courts, improved security, financial savings, care for vulnerable prisoners, less disruption of the prison regime, reduced escape risks and a reduced number of vehicle movements.</p><p>Sheriff Principal Bowen has pointed out that there are obstacles to overcome if we are to see more widespread use of TV links, but he also stated that they are not insurmountable. He states in chapter 9.4 of the report:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I recommend that consideration be given to extending the provision in section 80 of the 2003 Act to allow the use of a TV link for all solemn proceedings in which evidence is not to be led or presented. I further recommend that consideration be given to removing the requirement in section 77 of the 1995 Act that the accused must sign any guilty plea.\"</p><p>On the face of it, those suggestions seem to be eminently sensible. I would be grateful if the minister would give his view on that recommendation in his summing-up.</p><p>In supporting a change to the current rules to allow more use of TV links, I am particularly drawn to a comment in chapter 9.5 of the report, which refers to transportation of female prisoners from Cornton Vale to sometimes distant courts throughout Scotland, and back to that prison. I repeat the point that I made to the cabinet secretary during his opening speech, which Richard Baker also mentioned: given that Scotland has only one dedicated female prison, it would make a tremendous difference to what must be the regular&#8212;even daily&#8212;disturbances to that prison and the prisoners if TV links were established between it and a number of courts throughout Scotland. Because there is only one female prison in Scotland, female prisoners must travel the furthest distances to court and suffer the most disturbances. I accept that there are female prisoners in other prisons in Scotland, but Cornton Vale is the only national female prison. The costs, disturbances and inconveniences to female prisoners and to the Scottish Prison Service are unnecessary and the system is inefficient. It is high time that we resolved the situation through greater use of TV links.</p><p>It is not new technology, and videoconferencing is commonplace throughout society, so I see no reason why it should not be used more widely in <place-holder colnum=\"27757\"/> the Scottish courts. Given the fact that female prisoners in Cornton Vale have the longest journeys, and given the consequent costs and disturbances, will the cabinet secretary support the speedy introduction of TV links for Cornton Vale or will he, at the very least, take up Sheriff Principal Bowen's suggestion in chapter 9.5 of his report to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"establish a working group to examine the extension of use of TV links for all aspects of court business at all levels\"?</p><p>The cabinet secretary mentioned that in his introductory remarks.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20862522", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive Question Time &#8212; Health and Wellbeing: \"Independent Review of Sheriff and Jury Procedure\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Sheriff Principal Bowen, his team and the reference group for delivery of a comprehensive review of sheriff and jury procedures.

Although every anniversary of VE day is a cause for celebration, commemoration, remembrance and reflection, I hope that members will agree that there is some extra poignancy in the fact that a baby born on VE day reached retirement age last Saturday. By the time victory in Japan day comes around later this year, all those who were around during world war two will be pensioners.</p><p>That is why it is important that we do not lose the stories and experiences of people who lived through those traumatic times. For example, in the west of Scotland, John Docherty, who lost seven family members during the Clydebank blitz, remembers tables in the streets loaded with home baking, which he had not seen for a number of years. Hugh McIntyre of Port Glasgow recalls the bonfire at the junction of Clyde Street and Glenburn Street, which would have been unimaginable during the war, because of the blackout. In Giffnock, where my family home is, Iain Frew, who was nine at the time, remembers the blackout curtains being thrown aside and that he went to the Tudor cinema in Giffnock to watch throngs of people celebrating as an orchestra played through the cinema's open first-floor windows.</p><p>Those who were there have fantastic memories of an unforgettable day, but I imagine that, among the celebrations, immense relief was felt that the war in Europe was finally over and that brothers, fathers and husbands would come home. The services and support that would be needed to deal with many veterans returning to Scotland were not at the forefront of people's minds.<place-holder colnum=\"26112\"/></p><p>It is right and proper that we pay special attention to the second world war, but we must not forget what has occurred since then. Europe returned to peace on 8 May 1945, but allied forces were still fighting in the far east and the Pacific. It is unfortunate that the end of the second world war did not mark a time of peace for our armed forces, which have been asked time and again to answer the call in many wars and conflicts&#8212;in the Korean war, the Suez crisis, the Falklands, Northern Ireland, the Gulf war, the Iraq war and Afghanistan, to name but a few.</p><p>All those conflicts have resulted in new waves of veterans who have had to adjust to life after the horrors of war. It is unfortunate that some fail to do so. In the Falklands war of 1982, 258 service personnel died. Since that time, it has been reported that 264 veterans of that war have committed suicide. That second figure should alert us to the urgent need for psychological and mental health support and services for some veterans.</p><p>As we commemorated the 65th anniversary of VE day last Saturday, hundreds of soldiers marched through Edinburgh to mark their return from a six-month tour of Afghanistan. The men and women of 3 Rifles and 1 Scots&#8212;a 1,400-strong battle group&#8212;also marched to honour their 30 comrades who were lost in the Afghan conflict. That is the highest death toll of any Scots regiment in 60 years.</p><p>In many ways, we are good at paying our respects to those who have been killed in action. However, we are not as good at dealing with the aftermath of military service and particularly with people who emerge with physical and/or mental injuries.</p><p>Most people who leave the armed forces go on to lead successful and productive lives outside the military, but the transfer to civilian life is somewhat more difficult for a minority. Some veterans have obvious challenges to overcome that relate to the physical injuries that they have sustained on active service. Others show no outward sign of difficulty but soon succumb to mental illnesses. The figures are unclear, but veterans are likely to make up a higher percentage of the prison population than they do of the population at large. A more recent phenomenon that people who work with veterans have had to deal with is veterans who have contracted diseases of old age, which are sometimes complicated by the emergence of psychological problems that have been buried for many years and perhaps even decades.</p><p>When I was made the Minister for Communities and Sport in 2007, I discovered that one responsibility that was hidden in my title was that of dealing with veterans issues. I was greatly impressed by the work that was being done throughout Scotland to support our veterans, <place-holder colnum=\"26113\"/> particularly by Veterans Scotland, but I realised that we had to go further. That was why we launched the Scottish veterans fund in May 2008 and why I announced the consultation on \"Scotland's Veterans and Forces' Communities: meeting their well-being and welfare needs\" in June 2008.</p><p>As a result of those initiatives, improvements have been made, such as the extension of the priority treatment scheme to all veterans, including reservists; priority access to shared-equity schemes; the extension from spring 2011 of the concessionary bus travel scheme to forces veterans who were seriously injured while on duty; and increased funding for the Combat Stress charity.</p><p>I was fortunate to visit Combat Stress's centre at Hollybush house in Ayrshire, where I talked to veterans and saw the excellent work that is done there. I also visited Erskine hospital to see the work that was being done and to distribute several veterans badges to residents. The tie that I am wearing&#8212;with pride&#8212;is the Erskine tie, which was a gift to me when I visited.</p><p>The veterans badge that I distributed to the Erskine veterans is available to all men and women who have served in Her Majesty's armed forces. I encourage people who have been in the forces to apply for the badge. I was fortunate to help my uncle to receive his veterans badge just a few weeks ago. Applying is simple and the short application form can be posted, faxed or even sent electronically to the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency. The badge might be a small symbol of our appreciation, but veterans deserve to be recognised. I hope that many veterans throughout Scotland will wear their badges with pride.</p><p>Good work has been done and it continues, but we must keep it up if we are to repay the debt that we owe our veterans&#8212;particularly those who have been injured in the line of duty.</p><p>Arguing for fair treatment for veterans should be unnecessary, but it is clear that we still need to do so. Only today, I picked up from the exhibition outside the chamber a leaflet from the Equality for Veterans Association, which argues for fair treatment in pensions. I wish the association very well in its campaign. I signed the petition that it has put on the table in the lobby outside the chamber. I urge other members to do so, too.</p><p>When we commemorate VE day, let us also reflect on our duty as a country to ensure that all our veterans are treated with the respect that they deserve. Among the many things that we need to tackle is the risk that young people end up with the wrong idea about who our veterans are. There is a danger that some perceive our veterans as old <place-holder colnum=\"26114\"/> men from a war that was fought long ago. The truth is very different: the veterans community is large and varied. It is made up of men and women of all ages who have one thing in common: they have supported and defended us in our hour of need. They deserve nothing less from us.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: VE Day (65th Anniversary)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Saturday 8 May 2010 was the 65th anniversary of VE day.

Having said that, I believe that, alongside the evidence, opinions and genuine concerns that we have received about the bill, a number of red herrings have been thrown in.</p><p>I listened to \"Good Morning Scotland\" with interest this morning, as it ran a story on this debate. One of the suggestions that was made by a contributor from <em>The Firm</em> magazine was that there was nothing wrong with solicitors having a monopoly with regard to the ownership of legal firms, because it was the same thing as airline pilots having a monopoly on flying planes. I thought that was a strange analogy to use as an argument against the proposed changes. It is true that pilots fly the planes, but they do not own the airlines, so why is it necessary for solicitors to own the business as well as operate within it? Nobody is suggesting that non-solicitors should carry out the expert legal work, just as nobody would suggest that non-pilots should fly the planes. It is necessary that the experts carry out the expert work, but it is unnecessary for them to be the sole owners of the operation.</p><p>Other members have raised the spectre of organised crime gangs or drug barons buying up Scottish legal firms. I wish to examine that suggestion in detail. There are a number of reasons why I think it unlikely that criminals will invest in or buy legal firms.</p><p>First, there is the robust protection in the bill itself&#8212;and I believe that it is robust protection. In laying out the rules governing \"Fitness for involvement\", the bill states, at section 49(1):</p><p class=\"indent\">\"An approved regulator must&#8212;</p><p>(a) before issuing a licence to a licensed legal services provider, or renewing it, satisfy itself as to the fitness of every outside investor in the licensed provider for having an interest in the licensed provider,</p><p class=\"indent\">(b) thereafter, monitor as it considers appropriate the investor's fitness in that regard.\"<place-holder colnum=\"25775\"/></p><p>The bill goes on to state, in section 50, what the appropriate \"Factors as to fitness\" are. Section 50(2) states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The following are examples\"&#8212;</p><p>and they are only examples&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"relevant as respects an outside investor's fitness for having an interest in a licensed provider&#8212;</p><p>(a) the investor's&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">(i) financial position and business record,\"</p><p>and, importantly,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"(ii) probity and character (including associations).\"</p><p>Concerns have been expressed in relation to not only people with a record, which is provable and clearly ascertainable, who might invest, but their associates&#8212;people who work in the same industry, if it can be called that&#8212;if the investor does not themselves have a proven criminal record. The bill uses the words</p><p class=\"indent\">\"probity and character (including associations)\",</p><p>which we should take care not to ignore.</p><p>In section 50(3), the bill gives the reasons why a person is presumed to be unfit.

However, it takes two to tango. I think that Cathie Craigie missed that point.</p><p>That brings me to my second reason for thinking that criminal gangs are unlikely to think that investing in an ABS is desirable. Solicitors and other people who might form an ABS, such as accountants, will not be exempt from operating within the rules of their own profession. Even if an investor tried to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"solicit unlawful or unethical conduct\",</p><p>the collusion of the solicitor or accountant would be required for the improper behaviour to occur. Such collusion on the part of a solicitor, for example, would have serious implications, because the individual concerned would run the risk of losing their right to carry on working as a solicitor.</p><p>My third reason for rejecting the notion that the criminal fraternity will take over legal firms can be summed up in one phrase: why would they bother? Given the sanctions and difficulties that they would face in dealing with professionals who operate under a high ethical code and who would have much to lose personally, why would people involved in organised crime choose to buy a legal firm? If a so-called Mr Big needs a solicitor they can engage one. Why would they get involved in investing in a firm, with all the extra problems that doing so could and probably would bring?</p><p>Some people have suggested that criminals would buy legal firms so that they could use them to launder drugs money, but that seems unlikely. A criminal who is deciding how best to launder their ill-gotten gains could buy private taxis, sunbed salons or security firms. They would have a number of options. I cannot see why they would try to launder their money through a legal services provider rather than choose an easier option. The risk that criminal gangs will invest in or buy legal firms is pretty small and we should not be sidetracked by that suggestion.<place-holder colnum=\"25777\"/></p><p>Despite the heat that surrounds the bill, light has been shone into areas that required to be looked at, such as the role of the Lord President and the employment of solicitors directly by citizens advice bureaux. I note that the Government is involved in discussions and I hope that solutions can be found that will garner cross-party support at stage 2. I welcome the minister's comments on CABx.</p><p>I am concerned about sanctions against outside investors. In committee I noted that, although inappropriate behaviour on the part of an outside investor could lead to the suspension or revocation of an ABS's licence, the bill appears to provide no sanctions against the individual. I welcome the general sanctions, but the outside investor appears to be left almost untouched. Will the minister seriously consider adding to the bill provisions for sanctions against an individual outside investor who has behaved inappropriately? It does not seem right that the only sanction against the actions of an individual would be the closing down of the entire business, which could have a devastating impact on many innocent individuals.</p><p>The bill is controversial in some people's eyes and much work remains to be done on it. However, we must face the world as it is and not as some people would like it to be.

However, if it emerges after a trial that the trial was tainted in some way, if the person confesses to the crime or if new evidence emerges, it cannot be right that the guilty can walk free.</p><p>Although not everybody is in favour of new evidence as a reason to set aside double jeopardy, that is the area that most needs to be included in any change. It makes no sense to suggest that changes to the rule on double jeopardy should be limited to tainted trials, for example. There can be no one who does not understand the implications of the emergence of DNA evidence in relation to double jeopardy, but the issue concerns not only DNA. We do not know what new technologies will emerge in the future to allow us to ensure the conviction of the guilty, although the cabinet secretary listed some possible examples.</p><p>In Australia, the demand for change was driven by the Regina v Carroll case, which hung on inconsistent testimonies as to the identity of the person who was responsible for the bite marks that were found on a baby who had been killed. Mr Carroll was eventually freed on appeal, but subsequent advances in medical technology revealed that he was indeed responsible for the bite marks and for the baby's death. That shows that DNA advances are only one type of new evidence that can shine new light on old cases.<place-holder colnum=\"24888\"/></p><p>A major issue is whether all cases, or just a limited number, should be open to retrial. Logically, it seems that the argument in favour of change should apply equally to all cases but, in practical terms, that is not necessary, proportionate or appropriate. The main question that we must answer is where we draw the line, but that is difficult, as other members have stated. I do not think that there is any disagreement in relation to the offences of murder and rape, but it is clear that even among those who agree that there should be a change in the law there is disagreement about how far we should go. That is perfectly illustrated by the Liberal Democrat amendment, which I do not support. I am astonished that the Lib Dems do not accept that, for example, genocide or sexual offences against children merit inclusion&#8212;or, as Mike Pringle said earlier, that they are serious enough.</p><p>I would generally support the list of offences that have been chosen in England and Wales for exemption from the rule against double jeopardy, but there are gaps in that list.

In all honesty, I can see no logic in saying that such changes should not be retrospective. If we do not allow retrospective application of changes to double jeopardy law, we are endorsing the past injustices that have been perpetrated on Scottish citizens. That is unacceptable. One of the greatest advances in criminal investigation has been the application of new technology to cases and, in particular, the introduction of DNA evidence. Advances in DNA evidence are leading to the solution of cases in which no person was convicted at the time or has been subsequently&#8212;so-called cold cases.

Although Tasers are less lethal than firearms, I want to talk for a moment about those methods of control that are usually seen as less harmful than Tasers. What lies behind the debate is the commonly held view that the use of Tasers must be more dangerous to suspects than other methods of subduing an individual. We have to ask ourselves whether that is true. People's views are coloured by the somewhat indiscriminate use of Tasers in some parts of the United States of America, but Tasers are in use elsewhere in the world. For example, research in Canada examined cases in which Calgary Police used Tasers, pepper spray, batons or weapon-free control techniques. The conclusion of the report is that Tasers score highly on safety for suspects and officers. Where Tasers were used, about 1 per cent of those being arrested required to be admitted to hospital. Where batons were used, more than 3 per cent were hospitalised. With Tasers, 12 per cent needed minor out-patient treatment, whereas with batons, 26 per cent required out-patient treatment.

The research shows that, when similar incidents are compared, Tasers cause fewer injuries than batons or even empty-handed physical restraint. We have to be careful about the language that we use and the position we take with regard to the use and impact of Tasers.</p><p>The other mistake that is made is the assumption that when Tasers are deployed, they will be used. Once again, the facts do not back that up. In New Zealand, over a 12-month period the police in Wanganui drew Tasers 132 times, but on 92 per cent of those occasions, the result was the resolution of the incident without the Taser being discharged&#8212;an impressive statistic.</p><p>Another of the claims surrounding the use of Tasers is that they are used inappropriately on a suspect, or discharged several times. Although there are often disputes between officers and suspects about what occurred, such disputes can be resolved quite easily. In Canterbury, New Zealand, Taser units with video and sound recorders have been introduced to avoid that problem and to provide an accurate record of what occurred.</p><p>While it is right that we are cautious about the introduction of any new methods of restraint to be used by the police, we have to be careful not to let hyperbole get in the way of the facts.

It is clear that, throughout his investigation, Paddy Tomkins consulted a wide range of agencies, from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution to the Scottish Federation for Coarse Angling. Among the many excellent contributions, a particularly illustrative one came from a member of a mountain rescue team, whom Mr Tomkins credits with saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The mountains are perfectly safe as long as you remember how dangerous they are.\"</p><p>The same can be said for open water.</p><p>It might seem strange to quote advice from a mountain rescuer when discussing water rescue in Scotland, but parallels can be drawn and lessons can be learned. The remarks from that member of a mountain rescue team no doubt come from years of experience of rescuing people from dangerous situations and implementing preventive measures to keep them out of trouble in the first place.</p><p>Of course, it is important to underline the fact that there is a distinction between being injured on or needing to be rescued from a mountain and needing to be rescued from a body of water such as a loch or river. People who lose their way or get hurt on Scotland's mountains might be able to take shelter, thereby giving rescuers a decent window of time&#8212;perhaps many hours&#8212;in which to launch a rescue. Falling into a flowing river or a deep and icy loch does not give rescuers much time to rescue successfully an individual. We should not, therefore, overestimate our ability to rescue people in such situations.</p><p>Over the years, the Scottish mountain rescue service has become a good example of how a group of dedicated volunteers can keep climbers and visitors to Scotland's beautiful mountain ranges aware of how to stay safe, as well as offering an excellent rescue service should they get into trouble. Perhaps a similar approach could be looked at for Scotland's lochs and rivers. A good example of where that might apply is at Loch Lomond, in my West of Scotland region. At approximately 24 miles long, five miles wide and 663ft deep, Loch Lomond is the UK's largest expanse of fresh water. Its scenic beauty draws many visitors to the area, but its beauty can hide the risks that people face. The Loch Lomond rescue boat, an independent Scottish charity operated by a team of 20 dedicated volunteers, is situated on the west shore of the loch. That team of highly trained specialist volunteers ensures that a rescue service is provided for the public. It also encourages, promotes and teaches all aspects of safety in and around the waters of Loch Lomond, <place-holder colnum=\"23056\"/> including the safety of people using boats, canoes, wind surfers, jet skis and other vessels on the loch. The boat currently in operation can reach the furthest end of the loch within 20 minutes. However, its running costs are not cheap&#8212;the annual cost is &#163;12,000 and the initial purchase price was &#163;150,000 in 2006. Not only must we weigh up the costs of existing and potential services, we must help to spread the responsibility of the various front-line services in this country.</p><p>As others have said, it is estimated that there are around 27,000 lochs in Scotland, which makes any permanent patrol of them impossible. Furthermore, if we compare the rates of water-related incidents with those of road traffic accidents, for example, we gain a better understanding of their relative demands on our emergency services and others. As James Kelly said earlier, each year in Scotland there are around 17,500 traffic accidents that result in around 300 fatalities. That does not include the thousands of injuries and enormous economic impact that follow. In contrast, thankfully, there are relatively few drownings each year. That is not to underestimate the enormous impact resulting from each one of those fatalities, particularly on family members. However, we must be aware of the difficulty that we face in eliminating the risk of drowning, given the amount of water that Scotland has.</p><p>A clear message from Mr Tomkins's review is that, although some regular users of Scotland's inland waters, for sport and recreational purposes, for example, are well aware of the significant dangers posed by lochs and rivers, the general public as a whole does not have a single level of awareness of the risks posed by Scotland's waters. Therefore, I agree with Mr Tomkins's recommendation that we should explore opportunities for implementing a countrywide communications strategy on water safety education. I was pleased to hear the minister's remarks about that.</p><p>The need for a national campaign about the dangers posed by Scotland's waterways has been well illustrated in recent weeks. The recent freezing weather conditions throughout Scotland brought with them numerous challenges, not least due to the number of incidents of people falling through the ice on frozen lochs and canals. The high-profile example that Angela Constance mentioned earlier of the two men who plunged into a canal in West Lothian after driving recklessly across the frozen water is perhaps one example of where better public knowledge of the risks would have been helpful; or, in the case of those gentlemen, perhaps not.</p><p>The <em>Lennox Herald</em> in Dumbarton reported last week that families with young children were \"dicing <place-holder colnum=\"23057\"/> with death\" by venturing out onto a frozen patch of Loch Lomond. Children, apparently as young as four, were seen playing out on the ice. The paper also reported that people were riding bikes across it and even that someone was pushing an individual along the ice in a wheelchair. I agree that we do not want to discourage people from using Scotland's inland waters for enjoyment and recreational purposes, but a programme of public education would help to ensure that people are more informed of the potential risks, not only to themselves, but to those who might need to rescue them.</p><p>I also want to raise an issue about the funding of training and equipment purchases. I would be concerned if, in an attempt to deal with the problem of water rescues, we were to reduce the flexibility that fire and rescue services currently have in their spending in this area. The kinds of equipment and training that Strathclyde Fire and Rescue wants to prioritise for its firefighters might be very different to those that are top priority for Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters who work in central Glasgow, who perhaps deal with the M8 and road traffic accidents, incidents in high-rise buildings or tenements or even sewer rescues, will need certain types of specialist equipment and training, but firefighters who deal with problems in remote and rural communities will need very different equipment and training to deal with chimney fires and forest fires, for example. Whatever action follows the debate and the report, I suggest that we do not reduce the flexibility that individual fire and rescue authorities have to purchase the type of specialist equipment that they see as their top priority.</p><p>I welcome the report and support its sensible recommendations. However, although we must do what we can to reduce the risks to people who enjoy our open water, we must accept that it will be impossible to remove all risk without impinging on the freedoms that we all enjoy, which I do not think would be acceptable.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20514570", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Affairs and the Environment: \"Independent Review of Open Water and Flood Rescue in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As other members have done, I begin by welcoming the report, which is timely and helpful to us in making progress on the issue.

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the current policy has failed. It has been tried for years and has had little or no impact on turning people away from a life of crime.

Inevitably, it will be for the chamber to take a view on the matter at stage 3, as the 50:50 split in the committee reflects the diverse views that are held across the chamber.</p><p>I turn to the proposal for a sentencing council.

I do not believe that we would be going far enough if we set up a sentencing council whose recommendations must then be approved by the court. That would not move us on particularly far.

A trend in recent years has been the increasing use of non-court disposals or direct measures such as fiscal fines. However, one of the unintended consequences of that trend has been that if two people commit an identical offence, receive an identical charge and both have their fingerprints and DNA taken, they can end up with two different outcomes. The person who chooses to go to court and is found guilty of the offence has their DNA and fingerprints retained, but the person who accepts the offer of a direct measure does not have their DNA and fingerprints retained. There is no justification for the difference and, as I have indicated to the cabinet secretary and the committee, I intend to lodge an amendment to close what I believe is an anomaly in the current rules.</p><p>One of the other issues that caused debate in the committee was the age of prosecution versus the age of criminal responsibility, as other members mentioned. The bill seeks to raise the age of prosecution to 12 from the current age of eight, while retaining the age of criminal responsibility at eight. That means that children between the ages of eight and 12 could no longer be prosecuted through the criminal courts. Although the change is long overdue, I do not support the proposals from some outside the chamber to raise the age of prosecution to 13, 14, 15 or even 16, neither do I support the idea that we should change the age of criminal responsibility. There are cases of children below the age of 12 who are clearly capable of understanding the difference between right and wrong and who have committed crimes for which they must take responsibility. Therefore, I am content to support the position that is outlined in the bill.</p><p>I will mention briefly two other matters in the report. The first is serious organised crime. I realise that some people are concerned about <place-holder colnum=\"21598\"/> some aspects of that area of the bill, in particular section 28, on failure to report serious organised crime. We must take a robust line on the matter as any gaps that we leave will be exploited by the very people with whom we are trying to deal. That is what happens at the moment. I recommend that members read the evidence on the matter that was provided to the committee by the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General.</p><p>My final point relates to the proposal to allow non-invasive post mortems, to which paragraphs 645 to 651 refer. Although it is not a part of the current bill, I raised the matter with the cabinet secretary and the committee and asked questions of the Lord Advocate when she gave oral evidence. We also received written evidence about it from the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities. Therefore I ask that, if possible, we get a definitive response in the summing-up today to the questions raised about the possible use of non-invasive post mortems in Scotland and, in particular, to the question whether a change in legislation is required.</p><p>I ask all members to support the bill at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20410761", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "James Kelly lays a false choice before the chamber.

Although we must never be complacent, it is worth pausing to reflect on the fact that the number of fire deaths in Scotland has shown a steady decline over the past 20 years. We should congratulate all members of the fire service on their unstinting efforts. However, despite those improvements, we still have a problem with fire deaths. When I started working for Strathclyde Fire Brigade, as it was then known, in the early 1990s, a fire safety rate of more than 100 a year was the norm. I would therefore rather look at the trend over time than at any single year, irrespective of whether the figure is a record low or a record high.</p><p>The report makes a number of positive recommendations, including recommendations that recognise the need for close co-operation between fire and rescue services and other public agencies such as health, housing and social work. I turn briefly to the response to the report by the Fire Brigades Union. I agree with some of the FBU's points, but I was disappointed by its final remark, which was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The FBU urges MSPs from all parties to dismiss this report.\"</p><p>I do not believe that the report should be dismissed out of hand, because it makes many worthwhile points. It is right that we should look at reports with a critical eye, but we should not dismiss this report as suggested. I particularly welcome the report's proposals on sprinklers and the introduction of reduced ignition propensity cigarettes, to which I will return in a moment.</p><p>In Scottsdale, Arizona, in the USA, sprinklers were made mandatory in all new buildings in 1986. More than 53 per cent of the city is now protected by sprinklers. There have been no fire deaths in buildings that are covered by sprinklers, while there continue to be deaths in buildings without sprinklers. I am convinced that the introduction of domestic sprinklers would make a tremendous difference&#8212;my colleague Michael Matheson will cover that in more detail.</p><p>I will concentrate on a recommendation in the report that I believe could easily be overlooked but which has the potential to have the most immediate and greatest impact on fire safety rates of any of the recommendations: the introduction of RIP cigarettes. I am glad that the minister paid close attention to that issue. I thank the compilers <place-holder colnum=\"21210\"/> of the \"Scotland Together\" report for giving me the opportunity to talk about that issue and I thank the FBU for its support on the matter. I also thank the Chief Fire Officers Association in Scotland for acknowledging, in its parliamentary briefing, the work that I have done on RIP cigarettes.</p><p>As other members have said, over the past few years in Scotland around 41 per cent of fire deaths have been caused by smoking materials. That means that four in every 10 fire deaths are attributable to smoking. However, I take the very serious point that Linda Fabiani made about the impact of alcohol on many of those deaths.</p><p>New York state was the first state to make RIP cigarettes the only cigarettes that can be sold. It was followed by Canada in 2005 and by Vermont, Illinois, New Hampshire and California in 2006. They will be joined by North Carolina in January 2010. Soon, 99.8 per cent of the US population will be protected from cigarette fires. Australia will introduce a similar measure in March 2010 and Finland will become the first European country to adopt such a measure in April 2010. As I pointed out in my intervention during Mr Kelly's speech, it is perfectly acceptable for individual American states and European and other countries to introduce such measures, so I am at a loss to understand why the UK has not introduced legislation.</p><p>In the four years before the measure on RIP cigarettes was introduced in New York state, 167 deaths were caused by smoking materials. In the four years following its introduction, the equivalent figure was 113 deaths&#8212;a decrease in fire deaths of 54, or 32.34 per cent. In other words, fire deaths fell by one third after the introduction of the law on RIP cigarettes. Between 1999 and 2006 in Vermont, smoking materials were the leading cause of fire deaths&#8212;they were responsible for 19 per cent of such deaths. In the two years since the introduction of the law on RIP cigarettes in Vermont, there have been no fire deaths attributable to smoking materials.</p><p>Why has a law on RIP cigarettes not been introduced here? It cannot be due to lack of knowledge, as such laws were first introduced in the US some years ago. Over the past five years, I have lodged five motions on the issue of RIP cigarettes. The first was in April 2004 and the latest was in June this year. Although progress has been made over those five years on people's acceptance of the idea, I am disappointed&#8212;to say the least&#8212;that no law has yet been introduced in Scotland.</p><p>It is doubly disappointing that the UK Government has known for some years about the potential of RIP cigarettes to save lives. In a September 2009 letter to all chief fire officers, Sir Ken Knight, who is the chief fire and rescue <place-holder colnum=\"21211\"/> adviser to the Department for Communities and Local Government, talks about research into RIP cigarettes that was carried out in 2004. He states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This research estimated that had cigarettes in the UK conformed to the US standard, introduced in New York in 2003, the number of smoking-related fires would have been reduced in that year by nearly two thirds.\"</p><p>His letter goes on to say that RIP cigarettes</p><p class=\"indent\">\"could potentially reduce the number of fire deaths and injuries by up to 68%, meaning that in the UK, in 2007, up to 75 lives could have been saved.\"</p><p>The question why the UK Government has failed to introduce such a vital and life-saving measure, despite knowing its potential to cut dramatically fire deaths and injuries, remains unanswered. It is for UK ministers to explain why, years after New York introduced such a measure and five years after that research was carried out, people in the UK are still dying needlessly from fires that are caused by cigarettes.</p><p>When John McKay introduced his private member's bill into the Canadian Parliament, which resulted in a requirement for RIP cigarettes, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Cigarette companies have known for years how to eliminate death and injury by changing the density of tobacco and/or making modifications to the paper. They don't do it because they don't have to do it. There is no requirement to force tobacco companies to make fire-safe cigarettes.\"</p><p>He was right when he said that seven years ago. In Scotland, we can see the impact of what he talked about and what failure to legislate for the introduction of RIP cigarettes has meant. Similarly, ASH Scotland has stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is scandalous that tobacco companies have failed to make their products less of a fire hazard. They have had the technology to make fire-safe cigarettes for almost 20 years and yet failed to market them to avoid costly law suits. This shows their callous disregard for public safety\".</p><p>The tobacco companies will not introduce fire-safe cigarettes unless they are forced to do so. There is no voluntary route to such a measure. Legislation must be enacted as soon as possible so that we too can dramatically cut our stubbornly high fire safety rate.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20376086", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Fire Safety"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the timely report \"Scotland Together\" and many of its recommendations on how we can make inroads into our unacceptably high level of fires and fire deaths and injuries.

Like other members, I do not want to jump to any early conclusions on the recommendations, but I will cover some general areas. Some proposals in the report will be welcomed by many people as long overdue, but at the same time there are areas of concern that need to be explored further. I will begin with those areas on which I believe&#8212;I certainly hope&#8212;there will be general agreement.</p><p>Several members have mentioned the report's support for lay assistants or McKenzie friends to assist unrepresented parties in our courts. Reform is indeed overdue in that area, and many people have argued for such a change for a great many years. The fact that it seems to have worked well in other legal jurisdictions should give us the confidence to make the change.</p><p>The greater use of mediation, which avoids the necessity to go to court, is also to be welcomed. I firmly believe that most people do not want their day in court. Instead, they want speedy and fair treatment that resolves their problem without risking costing them the earth.</p><p>The third unanswerable case for change concerns the position of part-time and temporary sheriffs. Other members have mentioned that. Such sheriffs should be a resource that is used only when necessary. Although I support the retention of the flexibility that they provide, it is clear that their use has become the norm rather than the exception. That is not conducive to an efficient civil justice system.</p><p>I turn to some areas on which there will be greater debate and perhaps disagreement. The first is the establishment of a civil justice council for Scotland. We need to be sure that such a body is absolutely necessary before we set it up. A permanent civil justice council might bring advantages, but the case for establishing one still <place-holder colnum=\"20483\"/> needs to be made. There is merit in keeping our system of civil justice under review, but does it follow that we need to establish a permanent body to do that? I am interested to hear the arguments on that in the coming months.</p><p>I also have concerns about the impact that the report's recommendations might have on the basic principle of access to justice for all. On the face of it, the proposal for a system that places appropriate cases in the appropriate court does not seem contentious, but we need to consider carefully a wider issue before it can be supported. Making a judgment on the value of one case against another is fraught with difficulty, and it will be tricky to come up with objective criteria that will enable that to happen to everyone's satisfaction. I note that, in its briefing to MSPs, the STUC objects to those changes, and the examples of the cases that it argues will be denied access to higher courts need to be investigated and, at the very least, explained by those who are proposing the changes. Justice delayed is justice denied, but is it not also true that justice downgraded is justice denied?</p><p>In research that it published earlier this year on the views and experiences of civil court users, Consumer Focus Scotland said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The research points to an urgent need for better information for the public, and wider access to support services in all courts\".</p><p>It also stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Courts themselves are not seen as user-friendly\".</p><p>Of course, no research will be able to quantify the number of people who are put off from pursuing their case before it even begins. Whether that happens because of a perception of what is involved or a fear of the cost, we do not know, but, despite its anecdotal nature, the evidence allows us to confidently suggest that many people are being dissuaded from pursuing legitimate claims.

I know that the thoughts of all members go out to his friends, his family and, of course, his colleagues.</p><p>I welcome the minister's opening speech and, in particular, his announcement on the extremely difficult issue of pensions. It is a great credit to the Government that uncertainty about that has been removed, and I am sure that his announcement will be welcomed by members of the fire and rescue services across Scotland.</p><p>I also very much welcome the fact that the great uncertainty surrounding fire control rooms, which swirled around for years under the previous Executive, has been removed by this Government. As someone whose final two years of employment prior to entering Parliament were spent working for Strathclyde Fire Brigade at the Strathclyde fire control room in Johnstone, I am only too aware of the anxiety that that uncertainty caused the staff there.</p><p>I want to move on to some of the issues that concern me about the future of the fire service and where we will go on the critical issue of fire safety. I will raise a number of issues that I have questions about, and to which I hope the minister will be able to respond in his summing up.</p><p>The first is about common fire standards across Scotland, or the risk to which the public may be exposed as a result of our not having such standards. I understand the reasoning behind the removal of the national incident response standards and why it seems logical to have standards that fit local areas. I am not suggesting for one minute that the centre of Paisley is the same as the north-west Highlands, and I accept the argument about local flexibility, as long as local flexibility is not to the detriment of local people. However, I ask the minister to lay out how the new framework will deal with the potential loss <place-holder colnum=\"19451\"/> of nationally comparable information, which allowed the public to be reassured that high standards were being maintained in their area. I also request that he pay close attention to other common standards that used to apply, such as those that covered operating procedures and risk assessments, so that he is certain that there is no diminution of the service that is provided to the public.</p><p>Another area that I have concerns about is inspection of the fire and rescue services, which Robert Brown mentioned. I seek assurances from the minister that regular inspections will be carried out and that rather than being a general audit, they will be conducted by experts and specialists. It is essential that there is robust scrutiny of a critical emergency service.</p><p>As the number of live fires to which an individual firefighter is exposed goes down as a result of the success of fire safety work and improvements in fire-retardant materials in homes, for example, the need for live fire training goes up. There can be no argument about that. In years gone by, firefighters could expect to gain enormous experience through on-the-job training, as they would be exposed to a large number and a large variety of fires. However, that is no longer the case, which is why we must ensure that today's firefighters are properly equipped, through first-class training and increased live fire training, to deal with any incident with which they are faced.</p><p>I turn to fire safety and the incidence of fires, fire injuries and fire fatalities in Scotland. Over the years, Scotland has had a rather unenviable reputation for fires and fire deaths. There is no doubt that a number of factors have contributed to that reputation: for example, the flammability of materials in homes, cooking styles, levels of alcohol abuse&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;and the high incidence of smoking in homes. I am glad that the number of fires caused by cooking is down and that the new fire-retardant materials that have been introduced in recent years have had a positive impact. Smoking rates are also lower and smoke detectors are now installed in many homes. However, despite lower smoking rates, smoking materials remain at the top of the list of causes of fires that result in deaths and injuries.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire and Rescue Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate myself with the minister's remarks on the tragic death of Ewan Williamson.

I am afraid that overcoming the problem will probably take many years, but there is no doubt but that we must focus on it, given the clear statistics on the problems that are caused by smoke detectors that lie unused, or smoke detectors whose batteries have not been replaced.</p><p>Over the past few years in Scotland, about 40 per cent of fire deaths have been caused by smoking materials. Members should think about that for a moment: four in every 10 fire deaths are attributable to smoking and smoking materials. It does not need to be that way. In June 2004, New York state made reduced ignition propensity cigarettes the only cigarettes that were allowed to be sold in that state. Its approach was followed by Canada in October 2005, and by Vermont and California in 2006. North Carolina will join them in January 2010 and Finland will become, in April 2010, the first European country to adopt the measure. In New York state, 167 deaths were caused by smoking materials in the four years before RIP cigarettes were introduced; in the four years since their introduction, 113 deaths were caused by smoking materials. That is a decrease in fire deaths of 54, or 32.34 per cent. In other words, fire deaths in New York state fell by a third following the introduction of RIP cigarettes. Between 1999 and 2006, smoking materials were the leading cause of fire deaths in Vermont&#8212;they were responsible for 19 per cent of them. In the two years after the introduction of RIP cigarettes, no fire deaths were attributable to smoking materials in Vermont.</p><p>I began to campaign for the introduction in Scotland of reduced ignition propensity cigarettes in the previous session of Parliament. I lodged a motion on the matter in that session, and there was a members' business debate on it. There is currently a motion on the matter in my name before Parliament, which I ask members to sign. As I said, the issue was considered in a members' business debate in the previous session of Parliament, but unfortunately, the relevant legislative power is reserved to Westminster, so the Scottish Parliament cannot act to stop the unnecessary deaths. However, we can send a strong signal and demand that Westminster act. The campaign has the backing of all eight of Scotland's fire brigades and of the Fire Brigades Union. I ask the minister and Parliament to lend their weight to my campaign for RIP cigarettes to become, as soon as possible, the only cigarettes that are available in Scotland.</p><p>Stopping smoking is the best fire safety strategy.

Alcohol sales are price-sensitive and, with alcohol now half the cost that it was a generation ago in real terms, I believe that we must reverse a pricing trend that has contributed to the devastation that we see in too many of our town centres and communities, as well as in our courts and hospitals.</p><p>Last Saturday night, in advance of this debate, I took the opportunity to spend several hours with the police in Paisley&#8212;I would like to thank the officers for their help in arranging that visit. They confirmed the fact that cheap drink that is bought from the off-trade is a considerable problem, and that the drinks of choice fell into the cheap and strong category at which minimum pricing is targeted. They mentioned cheap, large bottles of cider and supermarket vodka, and they related a story of a boy who spent a night in accident and emergency after his first taste of alcohol&#8212;or perhaps, I should say, his first bucket of cheap booze from his local supermarket.</p><p>I am sure that some members will trot out the usual lame arguments about why we should not interfere with the supermarkets and the off-sales right to trade, but the sale of alcohol cannot be compared with the sale of tins of soup or packets of washing powder. The likely effect of a two-for-one promotion on washing powder might be cleaner clothes, but the same offer on alcohol might mean a visit to A and E, a night in the cells or something much worse.</p><p>We might also hear the well-worn argument that the problem has nothing to do with price, given that countries such as Spain or Italy do not have such problems. However, although it is true that there are different issues and different cultures in those countries, it would be wrong to claim that they have no such problems. New laws have very recently been introduced in parts of Italy to ban drinking in the street and to impose fines on the parents of children who are found to be drinking. Those laws are being brought in because Italy is facing a rising tide of problems as a result of alcohol abuse. Although countries on the continent may be lagging behind us in this area, they are facing similar and growing problems.</p><p>When we come to consider the bill, I ask members to look at who supports and who opposes the measures, and their reasons for <place-holder colnum=\"19234\"/> doing so. I have no doubt that opposition will come from the supermarkets, but it is clear that support will come from the medical profession, the police and even those who represent the on-trade and who realise that it is the irresponsible promotion of cheap, strong drink by some in the off-trade that fuels many of the problems that we face.</p><p>I urge the Government to stand firm and be bold with its proposals on tackling alcohol abuse, particularly on the minimum price. It must be set at a price that has the desired effect, as anything less would be a missed opportunity. I say to Alex Johnstone that setting a minimum price so low that it has no effect is frankly laughable.</p><p>I turn briefly to the housing bill that will be introduced. I was privileged to be able to work as a minister on the housing bill proposals that are now being brought forward, and I am delighted that there will finally be an end to the right to buy for new-build social housing. I accept that that policy has had some positive impact&#8212;in producing some more mixed communities, for example&#8212;but the downside has been enormous. The loss of thousands of some of the highest-quality rented housing stock to future generations has been detrimental to our efforts to house people who are in desperate need of a home. The change in the bill redresses the balance and will be widely welcomed.</p><p>However, that alone will not solve the problems that we face. I am delighted that the latest figures for house building show that the SNP Scottish Government is building more social rented houses than the previous Lib-Lab Executive, and that we are seeing the start of a new generation of council houses.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20173890", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin my remarks by focusing on the upcoming bill on alcohol.

The bill has been a long time coming, given that it is many years since Patrick Harvie's colleague Robin Harper tried to amend the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. Like other members, I am certainly glad that we are finally here.</p><p>Other members have mentioned the problem of the lack of statistical data. When I did my research for the debate, I found it almost impossible to find solid information. Surveys and reports have been carried out, which I will refer to, but there is no solid statistical data. One of the benefits of the bill will be that we will get better statistical data.</p><p>I hope that another achievement of the bill will be that we will see an increase in confidence when it comes to the reporting of crime towards LGBT people and disabled people. One of the most important issues is that people in that position lack the confidence to report such incidents to the police, and I hope that the bill will help to change that situation. I also hope that it will help to bring about cultural change and a change in the general public's attitudes to such crimes, even if, as has been said, it is not a silver bullet.</p><p>Other members have mentioned various statistics, but the figures are worth repeating. Disabled people are more likely to be the victims of hate crime. In the 2004 survey by the Disability Rights Commission and Capability Scotland, 47 per cent of respondents had been attacked or frightened by someone because of their impairment; one in five had suffered an attack at least once a week; and of those who had been attacked, 35 per cent were physically assaulted, 15 per cent were spat at and 18 per cent had something stolen. There must be a problem in our society if people feel that such behaviour is acceptable.</p><p>However, a more recent report by the charity Scope in collaboration with the magazine \"Disability Now\" and the United Kingdom's Disabled People's Council found that disabled people are four times more likely to be violently assaulted than non-disabled people and almost twice as likely to be burgled, and visually impaired people are four times more likely to be verbally and physically abused than sighted people.</p><p>As Minister for Communities and Sport, I was responsible for equalities. In various discussions that I had, I found a clear and urgent demand for this legislation and widespread support for it from a range of groups. Something that sticks in my mind was a visit to the Dumfries LGBT youth group, who explained in very strong terms the problems that they faced, particularly in living in a rural community, and the differences between their <place-holder colnum=\"18117\"/> position and the position of those in more urban communities. One problem was isolation; those in the group felt that living in such communities created added pressures and difficulties for young lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. Of course the sole purpose of legislation should not be to send out a message, but I hope that an important part of this legislation will be the message that it sends to all communities in Scotland that it is unacceptable to hold certain attitudes and behave violently or aggressively towards LGBT people.</p><p>I will now do something unforgivable, for which I must apologise: I will quote myself. My plea in mitigation is that the document that I want to quote from is the Scottish Government's response to recommendations of the LGBT hearts and minds agenda group. It says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Changing attitudes will be good not only for LGBT people but for all the people of Scotland. ... We recognise the prejudice and discrimination that LGBT people have faced historically. And while there have been significant strides in law and policy over the last 30 years, we know discrimination still exists\".</p><p>That sums up the attitude of the Government and my attitude when I was minister.

I join other members in congratulating Mary Mulligan on securing this important debate as not only is it Shelter Scotland's 40 <sup>th</sup> anniversary but a time when many people across Scotland face particular housing difficulties.</p><p>We can, of course, reflect on the significant progress that has been made in the past 40 years, but we must recognise the major challenges that remain in addressing the complex issues of homelessness and housing need. The Scottish Government is not, and never will be, complacent <place-holder colnum=\"14239\"/> about tackling and preventing the trauma of homelessness. I believe that it is right to recognise how highly regarded our approach to tackling and preventing homelessness in Scotland has become internationally, to acknowledge the part that the Parliament has had in passing the homelessness legislation and to reflect on the part that Shelter Scotland has played in that.</p><p>We are of course proud of what has become known as the most progressive homelessness legislation in Europe, which is underpinned by the 2012 target. We remain committed to that target, although the real challenge of achieving it cannot be underestimated. The target and the wider progressive approach represent years of campaigning by organisations such as Shelter Scotland, which ensured that its understanding of the reality of homelessness influenced the policy making of successive Governments at a national level.</p><p>Given the ambitious and challenging nature of the target, it is important that the Government has a strategy for maintaining progress and momentum towards its achievement. Our priorities are clear: maintaining continued leadership and joint working at the political and corporate levels; investing in new build in the right areas to meet homelessness and wider housing need; improving access to existing housing, including that in housing associations and private rented stock; and, crucially, preventing homelessness before it occurs.</p><p>Those priorities are agreed with our partners in local government to create the framework within which to determine the appropriate local services to meet local needs. Across Scotland, that will be achieved through joint working with the voluntary sector, which will play an important role in taking the priorities forward and in providing the support that is so often crucial to preventing homelessness and sustaining resettlement.</p><p>The motion demonstrates the range of ways in which voluntary sector organisations such as Shelter Scotland have risen to the challenge in the past. I have no doubt that they will continue to do so. Over a number of years, Shelter Scotland's role has been many and varied: working on the front line to provide services and advice to those in need; providing training and informal local strategic thinking; and, of course, working as a key stakeholder with Government. With the expertise and practical experience that it brings to the table, Shelter is a valued member of a number of Scottish Government working groups and advisory groups&#8212;as Mary Mulligan, Tricia Marwick and Malcolm Chisholm mentioned&#8212;which range from research advisory groups for particular studies through to bodies such as the housing supply task force. We also work closely with Shelter on <place-holder colnum=\"14240\"/> particular projects. For example, officials are currently working in partnership with Shelter Scotland's new children's service to develop guidance on acting in the best interests of homeless children.</p><p>We are all aware that Shelter's 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary takes place against the background of extremely difficult times for the economy. I know that Shelter Scotland has felt a direct impact of that through a decrease in corporate and individual donations. As I said in my statement earlier today, we have acted swiftly to respond to the changing economic circumstances and their implications for Scotland's housing system. In the Government's first year, a record number of public sector houses have been started. In 2009-10, we will invest some &#163;640 million through the affordable housing investment programme. We are particularly proud to have kick-started a new generation of council houses&#8212;432 were started in 2007-08&#8212;so I welcome Mary Mulligan's comments on that. Many more council houses are planned, with the backing of &#163;25 million of Scottish Government funding. That is the right thing to do for the people of Scotland. The same point applies to our intention to end the right to buy on new-build social housing, to safeguard provision for future generations of tenants.</p><p>We are also aware that, to a greater extent than was previously the case, those who are vulnerable might, in the coming period, include people who have bought their own home. Shelter Scotland is again to the fore in responding to that situation so&#8212;as I noted in my statement&#8212;we are providing an additional &#163;40,000 for its helpline to deal with an increased level of calls. We are also providing &#163;230,000 for Shelter's housing law service, to ensure that expert advice is available to home owners who face repossession, to the agencies that support such individuals and to others who are in need of legal or housing advice. In addition, we are currently funding the Scottish housing advisory service&#8212;which Shelter provides in partnership with Citizens Advice Scotland&#8212;to provide second-tier assistance and training to local advice agencies throughout Scotland.</p><p>As is noted in the motion, the provision of online housing advice is another area in which Shelter's input has been invaluable. Quick access to reliable, user-friendly advice is important not only to individuals when they face a crisis but to a wealth of supporting agencies and local authorities. When we speak of legislation and national targets, Shelter Scotland's role in providing direct support to individuals when they need it most can sometimes be forgotten, but it is central to making a real difference to people's lives.</p><p>In my statement, I also drew attention to the establishment of a debt advisory forum and the <place-holder colnum=\"14241\"/> setting up of a repossessions group to advise ministers on whether further strengthening of legislative protection for home owners is required and on any other non-legislative steps that the Scottish Government and others might take. Shelter has been asked to join that group, so we look forward to its contribution.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor asked me some direct questions about homelessness. He seems to believe that all money should go to housing associations, but I disagree. I believe that there should be a mixed economy in affordable housing. I believe that there should be a balance in the suppliers of affordable housing across Scotland. However, I also believe that the vast majority of the funding will be for houses that are built by housing associations. We have made that pretty clear.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor also referred to homelessness in general. A number of initiatives are taking place and have been going on since last year. In 2008, there was a national consultation on allowing local authorities more scope to engage with the private rented sector. During 2009, regulations that have been identified as requiring amendment will be updated. Section 5 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 is currently under review. In 2009, the role of housing associations in tackling homelessness issues is to be inspected by the Scottish Housing Regulator.<place-holder colnum=\"14242\"/></p><p>Updated guidance on the development and maintenance of common housing registers is due for publication in the spring of 2009. Those are just some of the things that are under review. I hope that Jamie McGrigor accepts that we keep a close eye on the issue to ensure that whatever regulations and legislation are in place are fit for purpose to address current and future needs.</p><p>I assure members that the Scottish Government recognises the valuable contribution that Shelter Scotland has made&#8212;and continues to make&#8212;to tackle and prevent homelessness and to address wider housing issues in Scotland. In marking Shelter Scotland's 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary and moving towards the 2012 target, we have an historic opportunity to work together to deliver policies that inspire those who work to address homelessness throughout the world and which make life better for people who experience homelessness here in Scotland.<place-holder time=\"17:40:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:40.</em></p>", "hdate": "2009-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621947", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Shelter Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have this opportunity to mark the 40 th year of Shelter Scotland and welcome the publication of the booklet \"Shelter Scotland 40 years on\".

Today, I will provide further detail on the fund and the actions that we are taking to help Scottish home owners in the current financial climate.</p><p>Since the June statement, the extent and impact of the international financial crisis have intensified. The crisis will not deflect us from the long-term goal of increasing the supply of new housing. We are still working to ensure that Scotland is well placed to achieve that, once market conditions improve. However, we cannot and must not ignore the immediate effects of the crisis on families and businesses across Scotland.</p><p>Due to the global credit crunch and the economic recession, many households in Scotland are finding it increasingly hard to manage their finances. Unemployment is rising, and the number of households facing mortgage arrears is rising as a result. The Council of Mortgage Lenders predicts that the number of repossessions in the United Kingdom will rise from 45,000 in 2008 to 75,000 in 2009. It also forecasts that the number of households that are more than three months in arrears will rise from 210,000 in 2008 to 500,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>Those forecasts, and the wider impact of the economic downturn on Scotland's businesses and households, are of deep concern to the Scottish Government and, I am sure, to the Scottish Parliament. That is why we have acted swiftly and decisively to introduce a series of measures that will further our affordable housing objectives, help the housing market and the house building sector, and ease the impacts of the downturn on individual households.</p><p>Our economic recovery plan to help Scotland's businesses and families proves that we will not simply sit back and wait for things to get better. In August, we published \"Responding to the Changing Economic Climate&#8212;Further Action on Housing\", in which we set out the challenges that face the housing market and the actions that we <place-holder colnum=\"14166\"/> are taking to help to address them. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to deliver the commitments that we set out in that document. Today, we are issuing a publication in which we set out the progress that we have made since the document was published and highlight the further measures that we are taking to stimulate the economy and reduce the impacts of the credit crunch.</p><p>Over the past few months, we have allocated the first &#163;18 million of the accelerated funding for affordable housing; invited all councils to bid for the &#163;25 million that will quickly deliver much-needed new council homes; given a &#163;10 million boost to the central heating programme to provide help to a greater number of households in fuel poverty this year; and put in place an energy assistance package to help to reduce bills for people who are fuel poor. In addition, in light of the considerable success of the open market shared equity pilot in Edinburgh and the Lothians, we have committed to expanding the pilot across all of Scotland with a &#163;60 million budget in the next financial year. That will help more families to buy and stimulate the lower end of the housing market.</p><p>On 1 April, we will implement section 11 of the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003, under which lenders will be required to notify local authorities when they take legal action to call in a mortgage. The measure provides a safety net and will trigger advice and assistance to prevent homelessness. It also allows local authorities to plan general prevention services more effectively.</p><p>In addition, we are putting in place a range of measures to help Scotland's home owners who face financial difficulties. We want to ensure that everybody receives the best possible advice to help them to manage their finances and, where necessary, avert repossession. We believe that it is important that the means of accessing advice are wide and varied enough to meet the needs and personal preferences of individual home owners. To that end, we have provided &#163;400,000 of funding for a high-profile television and online awareness-raising campaign in which the Money Advice Trust encourages people to contact the national debtline as early as possible.</p><p>We have provided an extra &#163;1 million for citizens advice bureaux to increase the capacity of face-to-face debt advice services and made an additional &#163;3 million available to expand our in-court advice service and other legal advice services that help people who unfortunately face a court hearing. We will increase the income limits for civil legal aid. From the spring, more than one million more Scots will become eligible, which means that three quarters of Scots will be able to get free or subsidised help to protect their legal rights. Furthermore, we have provided an additional &#163;40,000 to Shelter to boost its helpline and <place-holder colnum=\"14167\"/> &#163;230,000 for its unique housing law service. We have ring fenced &#163;250,000 in the third sector enterprise fund for credit unions to help people to access affordable credit.</p><p>Taken together, those actions will help people with money problems to achieve financial security and stay in their homes.</p><p>Of course, we do not have access to all the powers that we would like to have. In many areas, responsibility for action falls upon the UK Government. We have been pressing the Government for further actions to support the housing market and vulnerable home owners, and we will continue to do so. In particular, we have called on the UK Government to implement the Office of Fair Trading's recommendations on the regulation of sale and rent back schemes.</p><p>We have welcomed UK Government proposals to help some owners. A new home owners mortgage support scheme was announced by the Prime Minister in December. However, the limited information that we have received from the UK Government so far in response to our requests suggests that the scheme may not help that many home owners. We also welcomed the reform of income support for mortgage interest. However, the reform takes benefit back only to 1995 levels. Like bodies such as the Council of Mortgage Lenders and Shelter, we believe that the UK Government needs to be far more ambitious in its plans for helping home owners who are in difficulty. We are doing everything that we can; we urge the Prime Minister to do the same.</p><p>One thing that the UK Government is doing is following Scotland's lead. Back in September, it announced its mortgage rescue schemes, five years after the establishment of the Scottish mortgage to rent scheme. Today, I will announce the details of the next part of our package to help home owners who are in difficulty. Our home owners support fund will build on the existing mortgage to rent scheme and develop a new mortgage to shared equity scheme to help some owners to keep ownership of their homes but substantially reduce their debt.</p><p>Recently, the performance of the mortgage to rent scheme was independently evaluated. The evaluation found that the scheme had been successful in helping many families to avoid the pain of being forced out of their homes. It also made a number of recommendations for improvement. Before we could implement the new home owners support fund, we wanted to consider the results of the evaluation to ensure that any new scheme was carefully targeted to provide effective support for those who most require it, while also providing best value for the taxpayer. We believe that the new fund will achieve both of those aims.<place-holder colnum=\"14168\"/></p><p>The final report of the evaluation is published today on the Scottish Government website. The key recommendations are that the processing of applications should be speeded up, costs should be reduced and the scheme should be better targeted. Although we do not accept all of the specific recommendations&#8212;it is important to note that some are for the UK Government to implement&#8212;we are revising the mortgage to rent scheme in light of both the evaluation and our operational experience. The changes are designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme by increasing awareness of it with advice agencies, lenders and social landlords; accepting applications to the scheme at an earlier stage; targeting households at the lower end of the market to ensure that support is focused on those who are least likely to be able to trade down; encouraging more registered social landlords and local authorities to participate in the scheme; under normal circumstances, barring people with second homes from applying for assistance; and requiring social landlords to accept the results of the scheme 2 survey carried out by Government-appointed professionally qualified surveyors.</p><p>The evaluation also recommended the establishment of a mortgage to shared equity scheme, something that we had already announced in June. Following careful consideration of the best way to help Scottish home owners who are in financial difficulty, I am pleased to announce today how the new scheme will work. Home owners with at least 25 per cent equity in their property will be eligible for the scheme. The Scottish ministers will take an equity stake in the house, allowing the owner to reduce the level of secured debt and manage their monthly finances more easily. We will appoint an independent financial adviser to assess an applicant's financial situation and recommend the level of stake that the Scottish ministers should take. It will be for the applicant to decide if the offer is sufficient to manage their debt. The applicant will also need to seek their lender's agreement to the new arrangements. Applicants will need to meet certain criteria, including taking appropriate advice and showing that they have explored all options available to them, such as discussing alternative payment schedules with their lender.</p><p>I confirm that we are increasing the home owners support fund budget by &#163;10 million, to &#163;35 million over two years, to meet increasing demand. Information on the operational details of the new mortgage to shared equity scheme will be published on the Government's website today. Both that scheme and the new mortgage to rent scheme will be open for applications from 16 March.<place-holder colnum=\"14169\"/></p><p>The measures that I have outlined represent a comprehensive and robust package of support for home owners who are in financial difficulty, particularly given the constraints that are placed on us by the tight financial settlement and the limited devolved powers that we have been given. However, we will always look to see what more we can do. That is why, as the Minister for Community Safety announced on 13 January, we are establishing a sub-group of the debt action forum to examine the issue of repossessions. The sub-group will consider whether there is adequate legal protection for home owners in Scotland or whether such protection needs strengthening, and will also examine what else Government and others can do to help. I am particularly pleased that Adrian Stalker has agreed to chair the sub-group.</p><p>Fergus Ewing also announced a number of changes to the debt arrangement scheme, which is available free and helps people with a disposable income to pay back their debts over a longer period, free from the threat of legal action. In addition, analytical work is under way to support the policy needs of the debt action forum and the short-life working group on repossessions. Analytical reports on debt, insolvency and repossessions will be produced on a more routine basis to ensure that our policy measures minimise the effects of the economic downturn.</p><p>The year ahead is unlikely to bring a significant improvement in the current economic conditions, but the Scottish Government is working hard to minimise the impact of the credit crunch. I believe that the package of actions that has been announced today will provide vital support to Scottish home owners in these difficult times.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14621857", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Home Owner Support"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In her statement to Parliament on 25 June last year, the Deputy First Minister announced a package of major reforms to deliver lasting improvements to Scotland's housing system, including the establishment of the new home owners support fund.

We will require social landlords to accept the results of the scheme's survey rather than implement a second survey, which should cut down on the time taken. We are removing the requirement to analyse the purpose of secondary loans, which will speed up the process, too.

I thank all the parties and their spokespeople for the constructive discussions that we have had in reaching&#8212;I hope&#8212;an agreed position on the resolution today.</p><p>I know that all members in the chamber agree that we want a Scotland where everyone can make vital life choices without threat of intimidation or coercion, or psychological or physical abuse. Whether to marry and who to marry should be decisions that are entered into freely. Forced marriage is a violation of human rights, an infringement of liberty and an abhorrent practice that has no place in Scotland.</p><p>To be clear, we are not talking about arranged marriage, which is a legitimate, common and successful practice in a variety of communities. Today's debate is about people who are forced to marry against their will, by coercion or threat, or through fear or manipulation.</p><p>Forced marriage has for too long been below the radar. It impacts on young girls and boys and on women and men across a range of communities&#8212;often vulnerable young people who are under the control of individuals or families and beholden to their elders with few means at their disposal to take alternative action.</p><p>We know from the experiences of those who have been forced into marriage how helpless, lonely and unsupported they feel, and&#8212;for those who have to leave their home environment, and sometimes their country&#8212;how traumatic it can be. The consequences of forced marriage are devastating to those involved. Many become estranged from their families and wider communities, lose out on educational opportunities and suffer domestic abuse, and there are high rates of self-harm and suicide.</p><p>One story that highlights the level of trauma involved concerns a young woman who suffered years of emotional pressure and abuse. It began when she was taken overseas at 17 under the pretext of attending a family wedding. When she arrived, she was told she was to become engaged to her cousin. She agreed when it was made clear that that would be the only way that she would be <place-holder colnum=\"13135\"/> allowed to attend university. She completed her degree while living under that threat, after which her family took her abroad, again under the pretext of visiting family. This time, she was told that she was to be married at once and would not be allowed to return to the United Kingdom until she had signed the marriage documents.</p><p>The young woman did her best to make her parents see her point of view: that she and her cousin had nothing in common, and that the marriage would be damaging for her. That emotional battle went on for five weeks and eventually, when the girl was exhausted and tired of being cursed by her family as a cause of dishonour and disgrace, she agreed to sign the marriage documents, but only if she was allowed to return to the UK. Thankfully, she was supported by Hemat Gryffe Women's Aid and is now seeking a divorce.</p><p>Sometimes those behind a forced marriage are motivated by a belief that the marriage will uphold family honour, realise long-standing family commitments or control the young people's behaviour and sexuality. They might believe that it will protect cultural and religious ideals or prevent what are regarded as unsuitable relationships. Whatever the motivation, there is no justification for forced marriage, and we will not and should not tolerate it.</p><p>Information on the numbers involved and the extent of the problem in Scotland is limited. The statistics from the forced marriage unit, which deals with approximately 300 to 400 cases a year, indicate that 85 per cent of victims are female, and that 30 per cent of all victims are minors. In January this year, the unit began to break down the origin of incidents that were reported to them. From January 2008 to September 2008, 40 reports came from Scotland.</p><p>One way in which we are exploring the extent of the problem is by jointly funding, with the UK Government, a confidential telephone survey. The survey will run for the period of the consultation&#8212;between December and March next year&#8212;and should add to our understanding of forced marriage in Scotland.</p><p>In 2007, the UK Government decided to introduce civil legislation in the form of the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007, which came into force last week. Civil court remedies are a devolved matter and those legislative changes will apply only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, the Scottish Government's consultation, \"Forced Marriage: A Civil Remedy?\", which is being launched today, gives us the opportunity to explore whether the introduction of new civil remedies would add to the protection that is available to those who are affected by forced marriage in Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"13136\"/></p><p>Those who are affected by forced marriage tell us, poignantly, that many do not want to close the door permanently on contact with their family and the wider community, despite what they have gone through. Many would not want to pursue criminal proceedings but would find civil court remedies helpful. In addition to questions on legal remedies, we will be using the consultation to ask what non-legislative work needs to be in place to ensure both that all those affected can access the support they need and that communities can contribute to preventing forced marriage.</p><p>Although forced marriage predominantly affects women, we know that men are also victims. The consultation expects to gather views on how best to support men and women who are affected by forced marriage. Key to progressing that support work and to contributing to the Government's thinking on the issue is the forced marriage network. The network's membership is made up of key partners from the statutory and voluntary sectors and includes the police, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Amina Muslim Women's Resource Centre, the national health service, Scottish Women's Aid, Victim Support Scotland and the Law Society of Scotland. I thank network members, some of whom are here today, for their invaluable contribution to the agenda. Their expertise is vital to the success of the consultation and to our wider work on the issue in Scotland. We hope that during the consultation the network will, with support from Government, bring as many people as possible together to discuss the issues involved and to let us know what should be done in the area. We need to hear the voices of those who are affected and those who understand the issues.</p><p>Among the victims of forced marriage are women who, for immigration reasons, have no recourse to public funds. That is a prime example of how our hands are tied by issues that are reserved to Westminster. I fully sympathise with the plight of those women but due to the Scotland Act 1998 the Government cannot provide funding or extend the remit of the Home Office scheme. I understand that the new system of support will be put in place in the new year. However, I am disappointed at the time taken to find a way forward. I will be keeping a close eye on the situation and I plan to write to the Home Office in the new year with the views expressed by the Parliament and by those who took part in the demonstration outside the Parliament earlier today.</p><p>Forced marriage is part of the broader violence against women agenda. Like every other member, I am clear that violence against women has no place here. No one should live with the fear of abuse or be stripped of dignity or self-esteem. That is why we support the international 16 days <place-holder colnum=\"13137\"/> of action to eliminate violence against women campaign. However, the Government's work in the area is not limited to the period of the annual campaign. It is an on-going priority for us all. Therefore, the Government has committed more than &#163;44 million over the next three years to tackling violence against women and children, including domestic abuse. That more than doubles the funding from the previous three years.</p><p>In recognition of the needs of minority ethnic groups and the specific barriers to support that women face, we fund a number of projects under the violence against women funding stream, all of which focus on the wider issues of violence and its impacts on women from black and minority ethnic communities. They include the Amina prevention, protection and provision project and other projects with Shakti Women's Aid, Hemat Gryffe Women's Aid, the British Red Cross and the Legal Services Agency.</p><p>It is not possible to prevent forced marriage without tackling the inequality and continuum of violence that women in Scotland continue to face. Trafficking is an area in which there have been some recent developments. As a Government, we are committed to tackling that abhorrent and vile crime, through partnerships with the UK Government, the UK human trafficking centre, the police and local agencies. We want to ensure that effective measures are taken to combat that form of serious organised crime.</p><p>On 2 July, to coincide with the release of the results of operation pentameter 2, we updated the joint UK action plan, which sets out the actions we are taking. During that operation, in Scotland alone 56 premises were visited, 35 arrests were made and 15 victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation were recovered. On 25 September, we announced our intention to legislate to provide the police with specific powers to close premises that are associated with human trafficking or child sexual exploitation. Those measures are intended for the forthcoming criminal justice and licensing bill, which will be introduced in the Scottish Parliament in 2009.</p><p>I am pleased to be opening the debate and, by launching our consultation, to be opening what is, in effect, the wider debate on forced marriage in Scotland. I hope that members agree that we have to take action on the issue. We have to change attitudes, increase understanding and awareness, and provide the support and protection that are needed by some of the most vulnerable people in our society. I urge all who have views on this very serious issue to make them known during the consultation.

We all agree that energy efficiency and microgeneration have a critical role to play not only in helping us to achieve our climate change targets, but in helping us to tackle fuel poverty and contribute to Scotland's sustainable economic growth. Increased action at individual, community and business levels is essential, so we must ensure that we have in place the right incentives to drive and stimulate that action. Some interesting ideas have been put forward this morning; we will look into how we can use those to build on the work that we are already doing.</p><p>This year, we launched the new energy saving Scotland advice network, which helps consumers and SMEs to reduce their energy bills and their carbon emissions. We have also recently introduced a new dedicated personal at-home service to help householders to find the right energy-efficiency and microgeneration solutions. We are improving the advice that is given and have committed up to &#163;13.5 million a year for the next three years to support uptake of microgeneration and community renewables&#8212;three times the funding that was provided by the previous Administration.</p><p>We are investing a further &#163;2 million and are widening the scope of our small business loan scheme to include microgeneration.

The research that we have done for the next energy standards, on which we plan to consult during 2009, indicates that low-carbon technologies including microgeneration will be a routine element in meeting the new standards. That will provide a flexible approach that will allow developers and designers to incorporate the right low-carbon solution for the building.</p><p>I will try to answer a few of the questions that members asked during the debate. A couple of members asked when the report on the renewables pilot will be published: it will be published by the end of the November. Its publication has been delayed a little, but I hope that members will be interested in it. Some members have written to me about it, and I am sure that there will be a debate around what it suggests.</p><p>Sarah Boyack asked about the red tape around planning for microgeneration. The Government is making progress on the relevant Scottish statutory instrument, which we intend to lay before the Christmas recess.</p><p>The energy efficiency action plan was mentioned by several members. The Government said in response to consultation submissions that the proposed Scottish climate change bill will require Scottish ministers to produce an energy efficiency action plan that will be regularly reported on, reviewed and updated, so that is also part of our plans.</p><p>A couple of members tried to suggest that there is a decrease in spending on energy efficiency. That is not correct. It is important to note that the enterprise, energy and tourism budget does not reflect the total spend on energy efficiency across the Government. Efforts to intensify action on energy efficiency will be undertaken by spending in a number of portfolios including housing, fuel poverty, transport, waste and so on.</p><p>Another member asked about the EU deadline for the introduction of energy performance <place-holder colnum=\"12333\"/> certificates, which is 4 January. The recent indications are that more than 400 people are already qualified to do that work, and a further 200 are in the pipeline.

Scotland is not unique in wanting such a legacy, but we are unique in starting to plan so early. This morning has been an example of Parliament at its best&#8212;united in its view that it is fundamentally wrong that our good causes should be penalised to pay for London 2012.</p><p>I welcome, and will reflect on, members' suggestions on how substantial lottery funding could best be used to capitalise on the potential of the games to inspire change across Scotland. Such ideas will make the difference between a good legacy and a great legacy. Although the legacy plan will be led by the Government, I know that we can achieve a successful legacy only by working in partnership. We will continue our work with local authorities and other organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors to agree the priorities.</p><p>Our vision&#8212;let me stress again&#8212;is to inspire lasting change across all of Scotland. The lasting <place-holder colnum=\"11201\"/> legacy of the games must not just help the people of Glasgow, but touch the lives of every community in Scotland and create opportunities from which the entire population of Scotland can benefit. The legacy must benefit not just sport, but all the good causes.</p><p>We heard many welcome and interesting speeches in the debate, so let me try to respond to a few of them in the time that I have available. In his opening and closing speeches, Frank McAveety made some interesting points, especially on the issue of volunteers. We need not just the usual suspects&#8212;a phrase that I think he used&#8212;or long-time volunteers to be enthused by the games; we need to get new people to come in and get involved. I first volunteered for the 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth games and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor talked about the funding for grass-roots and community sport. Such initiatives should be central to what we are trying to do. We want a genuine legacy not just for elite sports, but for grass-roots and community sport.</p><p>Both Ross Finnie and Christine Grahame pointed out&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;that achieving a legacy from the games will be difficult. However, that will not be impossible if we work together, plan early and&#8212;Christine Grahame made this point&#8212;have realistic ambitions. The games are a means to an end, as Ross Finnie said. I absolutely agree.</p><p>The main point that I took from Bill Kidd's speech was that the legacy for Glasgow should be about improved health and optimism in the city. I cannot agree more.</p><p>Jackie Baillie highlighted the more choices, more chances legacy in further education, skills and employment. Again, that is a central part of the legacy that we want to see. She also said that Scotland will lose not &#163;150 million but only &#163;116.4 million. I presume that she got that figure from the Big Lottery Fund briefing paper that we were all sent. Of course, &#163;116.4 million is the direct loss in terms of the money that will be transferred from Scottish lottery distributors to the Olympics. However, the following sentence in the briefing paper, below that table, states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In addition, there will be an impact as a result of diversionary sales away from mainstream Lottery games to dedicated London 2012 games sales\".</p><p>The briefing paper estimates that that will take the loss to Scotland to a total of &#163;184 million. We have said, entirely reasonably, that &#163;150 million of that should be retained here in Scotland to build our legacy plans.</p><p>James Kelly stated that there are challenges for Government and for local authorities. I agree. There are challenges for us all&#8212;for Parliament, for other organisations, for individuals, for charities <place-holder colnum=\"11202\"/> and good causes&#8212;to get involved in the planning process if we are to achieve an overall legacy that is a success.</p><p>Bob Doris asked the very relevant question whether community groups want the chance to apply for the missing money. Of course they do. It would make an enormous difference if those groups got that chance.</p><p>Hugh Henry gave a very thoughtful speech. Particularly pertinent was his point about Glasgow's health statistics. If we could change those, we could transform the health statistics of our country.</p><p>Robert Brown complained that my opening remarks were a bit general. However, we are in the middle of analysing the consultation responses&#8212;as he mentioned&#8212;so it would be wrong for a minister to stand up at this stage to say which specific projects and proposals will be supported. Surely he agrees that we need to ensure that the interim plan, which will be published by the end of the year, gets the opportunity to be developed before the full plan is published next summer.</p><p>Sandra White mentioned that it is no good waiting until after 2012, as some have suggested, for some of the lottery money to return. We need to plan and invest now. We need to use the six years that we have available to ensure that we get the maximum out of 2014.</p><p>Margaret Curran and Pauline McNeill said that we are not in an either/or situation, in which we must choose between the Olympics and the Commonwealth games. I absolutely agree. The 2012 games are part of our plans in building towards 2014. The Olympic games will be a stepping stone towards 2014, so we should do all that we can to ensure that Scottish athletes get the maximum out of 2012.</p><p>The issue of PE in schools was raised by both Margaret Curran and Mary Scanlon. Clearly, our expectation is that schools will continue to work towards the provision of two hours of good-quality PE for each child every week. That expectation is explicitly reflected in the guidance supporting the new three-to-18 curriculum. We are also committed to increasing continuous professional development of primary teachers in the field of PE. Over the next three years, we are investing &#163;1.8 million to support the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh in running a postgraduate certificate in education for PE.

It will be as relevant to skills coaching as it will be to sports coaching.

Our vision is that that lottery funding would support a wide range of initiatives including, but not limited to, sport. We would engage with the third sector to ensure that the funding was used across the range of good causes.</p><p>The enthusiasm of the people of Scotland for the successful bid for the Glasgow 2014 games was remarkable. Over one and three-quarter million individuals and organisations pledged their support for the bid, as did every political party represented in the Parliament. Much of that support was inspired by the great opportunities presented by the Glasgow 2014 games to make real improvements to people's lives, raise our sights as a nation and regenerate communities. From the outset of our bid, legacy has been at the centre of our plans. Delivering a games legacy is the heart of our overwhelming case for lottery funding to be returned to Scotland. That funding would help us to transform the wealth of ideas into a legacy that would benefit communities throughout Scotland and harness the passion and enthusiasm generated by the Commonwealth games.</p><p>Our vision is of a legacy that will help people live longer, healthier lives in strong, resilient and supportive communities, valuing and protecting the built and natural environment, with new and better skills development, and employment and volunteering opportunities.

We need strong club structures across all our communities, with clubs that are easily accessible, ready to embrace all abilities and have strong links to the wider community infrastructure. At the local level, we must work more imaginatively to ensure that we maximise investment in facilities and make the most of existing facilities. We need to break down the barriers that stifle the growth of our existing coaches and officials, who are so pivotal in nurturing future Scottish sporting stars.</p><p>The games also present opportunities to embed ethics and equality throughout Scottish sport, tackling discrimination, promoting equality of opportunity and ensuring safe and fair participation.

Our aspiration is that the games legacy will give fresh impetus to existing programmes and deliver new, sustainable programmes that give opportunities for Scotland's most disadvantaged to rebuild their lives, regain respect and restore their confidence so that they have a better share of Scotland's increased prosperity. The games can help us to create better-educated and more skilled communities, and to recognise those sometimes undervalued groups, such as older people and those with a disability.</p><p>We want to maximise the impact of imaginative initiatives that place sport and the arts at the heart of learning.

We want to use the opportunity of the games to rekindle the sense of pride in our communities and increase community engagement.</p><p>The construction of the venues for the games and the delivery of the event should be exemplary in environmental terms.

That is why we have introduced a series of measures and initiatives that are aimed directly at benefiting veterans living in Scotland. Perhaps the most fundamental of those was the publication in June of our commitments paper alongside and complementary to the MOD's command paper, both of which set out what the Government has <place-holder colnum=\"11151\"/> done for veterans and what we intend to do in the future in areas such as housing, health, education and skills, as well as in transport, support for families and wider access to public services. For the first time, the Scottish Government has set out a programme for assisting our veterans across Scotland and refocusing our efforts to combat the complex and varied issues that they face.</p><p>We have already made a start in fulfilling our obligations. For example, priority treatment has been extended to all veterans with a condition associated with military service on the basis of clinical need. Moreover, we will start the pilot of a new approach to community-based mental health services for veterans along with NHS Lothian and other partners in November. Other proposals in the commitments paper include provision by NHS Scotland of state-of-the-art prosthetics to injured veterans, to a standard similar to that of the defence medical services; priority access for service families to shared equity schemes to make house purchases more affordable, which we announced in June; improved access to higher education for service leavers with six years' service; and continuous automatic entitlement to the blue badge scheme for severely disabled veterans.</p><p>That is by no means an exhaustive list, but I give Parliament an unequivocal assurance that the Scottish Government is fully committed to fulfilling its obligations, and we will work strenuously with the MOD and veterans charities to ensure the implementation that most benefits our veterans. This morning, I met the heads of the armed forces in Scotland to discuss how we can work together to successfully implement the proposals.</p><p>The Government recognises that some of our veterans have to deal with the sometimes devastating physical effects and psychological impact of combat. I take the opportunity, therefore, to extend my appreciation to the many charities that tackle those issues head-on, such as Combat Stress, Erskine and Poppyscotland, which, along with a raft of other charities the length and breadth of Scotland, do exceptional work. Much of that work is unheralded, but it is nonetheless appreciated by those who benefit.</p><p>Of course, more can and must be done to deliver for veterans. In many respects, the veterans organisations are the best people to undertake the work that is needed. However, it would be wrong for the Scottish Government to sit back and expect those charities and organisations to shoulder the burden on their own.</p><p>Until now, the Scottish Government has not provided dedicated funding for veterans issues in Scotland. However, with my announcement in May of our intention to introduce a Scottish veterans fund, we have rectified that shameful anomaly. <place-holder colnum=\"11152\"/></p><p>The fund will make almost &#163;0.25 million available to veterans groups and charities over the next three years, and will be aimed at projects that deliver new or innovative approaches to veterans issues, or that seek to develop areas and activities that are not currently funded. We expect to receive the first applications to the fund by the end of November.</p><p>Furthermore, to ensure that the needs of veterans are reflected in future policy development, Dr Kevin Woods, the director general of health, has been appointed as the Scottish Government's armed forces and veterans advocate. Dr Woods will also join the MOD external reference group that is overseeing implementation of the command paper. Furthermore, the Scottish Government has now established a dedicated team within its social inclusion division to deal with armed forces and veterans issues, and to take forward our commitments and obligations. Officials are also examining the opportunity to set up an armed forces and veterans forum, which would be chaired by me, to provide for more direct engagement between Government and stakeholders.</p><p>The Government does not presume to have all the answers to the issues that our veterans face, but we are determined to work with colleagues and stakeholders to make a tangible and meaningful difference to their lives. I do not offer quick-fix solutions&#8212;that is not possible. Some immediate steps can be, and have been, taken, but our work will be an on-going process. It is a developing policy front. Many of the improvements that we seek are long term and will take months and perhaps even years to realise, so we must ensure that we maintain the momentum of the past few months.</p><p>To that end, I welcome the recent creation of the new cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on supporting veterans. As has been mentioned, a meeting of the group has been arranged for 30 September, and I am grateful for the kind invitation to join it to explore the opportunities that we have before us. I am also delighted that we can move forward in a cross-party, non-partisan way, and I look forward to being able to work closely and constructively with the group in the future.</p><p>I hope that many of the issues that have been raised in the debate have already been dealt with. Mary Mulligan and Murdo Fraser mentioned housing. It is true that in June we announced that priority access to our shared equity schemes would be open to forces personnel and recent veterans. We are also working closely with the MOD to identify suitable surplus MOD land sites and housing that can be used to meet housing <place-holder colnum=\"11153\"/> need. We have already had the first transfers of housing in Fife.</p><p>On adaptations, we propose to abolish the test of resources and to award grant at a minimum rate of 80 per cent&#8212;the current rate is 50 per cent. The adaptations grant will rise to 100 per cent for people who are in receipt of particular income replacement benefits. Even if they do not receive those benefits, local authorities will still be free to increase the award from 80 per cent to 100 per cent if they so desire.</p><p>As regards the mental health issues that Trish Godman raised, I very much agree with the excellent work that the organisations concerned have done. Earlier this year, we increased by 45 per cent the fees that are paid to Combat Stress to provide specialist mental health care and treatment, but I agree that much more still needs to be done.<place-holder colnum=\"11154\"/></p><p>As I have said, the Scottish Government is committed to doing all that it can to improve our veterans' quality of life, but the announcements that were made over the summer will mean little without the continued efforts of all those involved to ensure the implementation of the measures that have been outlined. I look forward to taking up that challenge and to working with the MOD, veterans organisations and the Parliament&#8212;in particular, the cross-party group&#8212;to ensure that that happens.<place-holder time=\"17:42:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:42.</em></p>", "hdate": "2008-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14035929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Veterans Support"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, it is an honour to offer the Government's response to the debate.

Scotland is not unique in wanting its legacy, but we are unique in starting to plan so early. It is recognised that it is imperative that we deliver lasting legacies from hosting major events. There needs to be significant benefits from the investment that is made.</p><p>Volunteering is a key area that we want to develop. The potential of the games to bring social change throughout Scotland is of massive importance. The games will require between 12,000 and 15,000 volunteers. I support the aspirations of the organising committee and acknowledge the plea of Volunteer Development <place-holder colnum=\"10919\"/> Scotland to explore the wider possibilities of volunteering.</p><p>The games have the potential to give Scotland's most disadvantaged the opportunity to rebuild their lives, regain respect and restore their confidence through volunteering. The games can inspire people of all ages to act in ways that benefit themselves and their communities. The spirit of the games can do so much to increase the number of volunteers across Scotland and the range of activities that they undertake. Sandra White and other members mentioned the legacy in respect of volunteering. I could not agree more, which is why we will take that forward in Government and with our partners in Glasgow City Council.</p><p>I volunteered at the 1986 games in Edinburgh, and I still remember the experience with great pleasure. The games were difficult in respect of the organisation and the problems that they faced, but for the many volunteers who took part it was a pleasurable and memorable experience. I would certainly recommend volunteering to anyone who is thinking about doing it 2014.</p><p>I am delighted that cross-party momentum is now building behind the view that we should receive financial support from the lottery to secure the legacy of the 2014 games. It is fundamentally wrong that our good causes should be penalised to pay for London 2012. In order to deliver Scotland's legacy ambitions for the 2014 Games, the &#163;150 million that was diverted from Scotland must be returned. With those funds, we can capitalise on the inspiration, ambition and levels of engagement that have been generated throughout Scotland by our winning bid. I agree that there has to be cross-party and non-party representation if we are to succeed in that plea.</p><p>Sandra White raised the issue of training, jobs and upgrading skills. I welcome Glasgow City Council's announcement that it will include community clauses in tenders for games-related contracts. That will be helpful in developing new skills and creating new jobs for local people.</p><p>In response to Jamie Stone's comments, I look forward to tomorrow's meeting. I am sure that we will have a thoughtful discussion of the issues that concern people, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>I say to James Kelly that, if my memory serves me right, the last time that there was not a Scot in the Ryder cup team was 1937, so it has happened on one previous occasion.</p><p>There is a problem with the school estate. The situation has improved in many areas, but there are access problems. The view of the Government and probably all members in the chamber is that we want as much community access as possible and we want facilities to be available for as long as <place-holder colnum=\"10920\"/> possible, so that not only schoolchildren but the community can benefit from facilities.</p><p>I look forward to enjoying the sporting spectacular that 2014 will bring to Scotland but, more important, I want to see a new sporting era for Scotland, of which 2014 will be but one highlight&#8212;albeit a very important highlight&#8212;over many years of major events and major sporting activity.

Members asked me when the Scottish Government will use the provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 and require landlords to sign up to a mandatory deposit protection scheme. However, it is by no means clear that such a scheme would be the most cost-effective or efficient way of dealing with the problem of unfairly withheld deposits in Scotland. The Scottish Government is considering the matter.</p><p>Much has been said this evening about the number of tenants, and particularly students, who face problems with unfairly withheld deposits. I am aware of the research that a number of organisations have carried out in the area, including the NUS \"Brick by Brick\" report. It is worth pointing out that the NUS research asked students whether any of their deposit had been withheld rather than whether it had been unfairly withheld. That distinction is important and it underlines the need for a balanced approach that is underpinned by robust evidence.</p><p>Members mentioned the success of the mandatory schemes in England and Wales. The Scottish Government is interested in the impact of those schemes, but we believe that the right course of action is to assess the outcome of any formal evaluation of the schemes. There has been no formal evaluation to date and the Scottish Government will not draw conclusions based on headline figures without a more detailed understanding of whether the schemes have an impact on the number of deposits that are unfairly withheld.</p><p>It is also the case that there are considerably more landlords and agents in England and Wales to support the costs of a mandatory scheme. The schemes in England and Wales are self-financing. They rely on income from the interest that is accrued against the deposits that are held in the custodial scheme or from the fees that landlords and agents pay to join the insurance-based schemes. Clearly, there are risks to the Government in relation to whether a custodial scheme in Scotland could become self-financing.</p><p>The two insurance-based schemes in England and Wales charge fees that range from &#163;58 to &#163;1,600 for landlords and agents. We need to take into account the fees that landlords in Scotland already pay as part of the mandatory landlord registration scheme and for the licensing of houses in multiple occupation.

The previous Administration shared that view. When Johann Lamont, in her role as Deputy Minister for Communities, gave evidence during the passage of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, she said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We will not introduce any scheme whose cost we consider disproportionate.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Communities Committee</em>, 5 October 2005; c 2502.]</p><p>Housing issues in Scotland are different from those in the rest of the United Kingdom, so we need to look for the right solution for Scotland. Members will be aware that a number of initiatives are under way in Scotland with the aim of increasing standards in private rented accommodation. Those include landlord registration and the repairing standard, neither of which exists in England and Wales.</p><p>All landlords in Scotland letting to three or more unrelated people require an HMO licence. In addition, our new national landlord accreditation scheme gives us an opportunity to promote good practice across the board in relation to tenancy management in general and not just tenancy deposits. In particular, landlord registration allows local authorities to take account of any evidence that landlords or letting agents have unfairly withheld their tenants' deposits. I encourage any tenants who experience problems with their landlord to contact the relevant local authority landlord registration team. Local authorities have a range of powers to take action when they are concerned about a landlord's practice.</p><p>The recently launched national voluntary landlord accreditation scheme will also help to drive up standards by promoting best practice in private letting and by providing training, advice and support for landlords, including training on tenancy deposit management. Over time, those initiatives should help to tackle any landlords or letting agents who are found to have unfairly withheld their tenants' deposit. It is that holistic approach to improving standards in private renting <place-holder colnum=\"9929\"/> in the round&#8212;not just in tenancy deposits&#8212;that will make a difference in Scotland.</p><p>The Government is taking steps to gather evidence on the scale and nature of unfairly withheld deposits.

I also congratulate all the members who have spoken in the debate, which has been interesting and filled with emotion and detailed information about what many unfortunate women in our country face.</p><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to wind up for the Government. I reiterate my commitment and that of the Government to tackling violence against women. We take seriously the issues that have been raised, which are complex, as they straddle reserved and devolved powers. Immigration law is a matter for Westminster, and the Home Office is actively considering whether to fast-track immigration applications by people who have no recourse to public funds.</p><p>In March, the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, and Vernon Coaker, an undersecretary at the Home Office, announced a new scheme under which victims of domestic abuse who have no recourse to public funds might be eligible to receive support for their housing and living costs. The new scheme will strengthen how domestic abuse cases are considered and enable vulnerable victims to access additional support. Under the proposals, which are still being developed, victims of domestic abuse whose applications for indefinite leave to remain were successful might qualify for a contribution to their costs.</p><p>The Home Office will also work with the UK Border Agency to develop a service level agreement to enable initial applications for indefinite leave to remain to be processed in 20 working days&#8212;such applications can currently take several months. That will greatly reduce the financial burden on agencies that support women in that situation. Guidance will be developed to assist voluntary organisations to ensure that the applications that they support have all the necessary detail, which will allow applications to be processed without delay. I also understand that <place-holder colnum=\"9252\"/> the Home Office will work with the UK Border Agency to look again at the criteria for assessing destitution to ensure that a robust process is in place to implement the destitution rule, which allows for the current &#163;750 application fee to be waived.</p><p>Most of that work will have implications at a UK-wide level, and will move towards alleviating the workload and stress involved in processing the applications. It is important that the issues are progressed as soon as is practicable. I am pleased to tell members that we have been advised by the UK Government that the scheme will be in place by this autumn.</p><p>Obviously, to the extent that matters are within Westminster's remit, our hands are tied, but I pledge that I will write to the UK Government to set out our concerns and those that were expressed by members during the debate and to reiterate our desire to find a way forward as soon as is possible and practicable.</p><p>The Scottish Government is progressing matters, too. As members have said, earlier this year we established a short-life working group to examine the possible options to help women who have no recourse to public funds. Scottish Women's Aid, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Shakti Women's Aid and Hemat Gryffe Women's Aid are among the group's members, in addition to officials from the Scottish Government's violence against women team and homelessness team. Its first meeting took place in February and, as Sandra White said, it met for the second time two days ago.</p><p>We are all aware that the issues are difficult, and the group is currently working to establish what information and data it needs to consider possible workable options on the way forward. The group is, of course, aware of the report by Amnesty International and the Southall Black Sisters, which provides a useful context for its considerations; it also has regard to the role of the UK Government and its emerging proposals.</p><p>I await the group's report, which I expect later this year, and I assure Parliament that I will take its findings seriously and will consider what practical and sustainable measures we can take to ensure that this particularly vulnerable group of people are treated appropriately. In the meantime, my officials will continue to liaise with their counterparts in the Home Office and to ensure that we are fully aware of the progress that is being made south of the border as far as reserved matters are concerned. As I said, I will write to the undersecretary at the Home Office, Vernon Coaker.</p><p>It might also be helpful for views on this area to be fed into the national conversation. I do not seek <place-holder colnum=\"9253\"/> to make a party-political point, but we clearly need a full exploration of the devolved and reserved aspects of the issue, and there must be clarity over the limitations of what we in the Scottish Government can progress. I encourage all those involved and those with concerns about people who have no recourse to public funds to participate in that discussion.</p><p>What we can and will do is continue to support the work of organisations that address the full range of violence against women issues&#8212;I include in that the support that is given to Scottish Women's Aid and the network of local groups. In addition, five projects that are currently funded from the violence against women funding stream are working on the issues around women with no recourse to public funds in the context of wider issues of violence and its impacts on women from black and minority ethnic communities.</p><p>Obviously, it is of deep concern if Women's Aid or other groups are struggling financially, for whatever reason. If there are ways in which we can help, we will of course consider those fully, but we have to be realistic about what we can do pending further progress at a UK Government level.</p><p>I will cover some of the many issues that members raised in the debate. I share the concern that Cathy Peattie expressed about children being taken into care or given to an abusive partner. The fundamental point is that the best interests of children must be paramount. If she has details of the case that she mentioned, I would be more than happy for her to write to me about it. I will take up the issue as appropriate, but I will definitely look into it, because I share her concerns.</p><p>Sandra White asked for an update on the working group meeting. It considered the responses to the Scottish Women's Aid survey of prevalence, which was undertaken with all women's aid groups. It agreed a timescale of September 2008 for the first draft of the working group's report, which will include recommendations. It also discussed difficulties faced by individual local authorities. The next meeting will take place in September 2008.</p><p>I agree with Gil Paterson's comments about trafficking. For his information and that of other members, the UK Government aims to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings during 2008. I hope that we can all welcome that, because, frankly, it is overdue. I am pleased that the UK Government has taken that step.</p><p>Johann Lamont raised several issues. To sum up, she said that the matter is above party politics and that both the previous Executive and the SNP Government have considered it. Of course, I <place-holder colnum=\"9254\"/> absolutely agree with her comments on trafficking, prostitution and male violence against women, and I thank her for her constructive comments on the short-life working group that has been established.</p><p>The issue affects all the parties that are represented in the chamber and all members, whether they are male or female and no matter what their background is.</p><p>I thank members for taking part in the debate, which has been constructive. There is a degree of consensus and a shared desire to find a way around the existing obstacles and to help the women in question.

I am pleased to make that statement today.</p><p>The Scottish Government's investment and activity are geared around one central purpose: to create a more successful country that offers opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish. That means striving for a fairer and more equal Scotland. Addressing the inequalities in our society is essential if we are to meet the challenges of globalisation and demographic change and to ensure the wellbeing and cohesion of Scotland's communities. The spending review and budget are integral to enabling us to deliver that purpose and driving forward the changes that are needed to ensure equality of opportunity and outcome.</p><p>We have no doubts that Scotland will benefit from greater equality and that it is wholly unacceptable that people should be disadvantaged because of their race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, faith or age. Our performance framework contains a suite of outcomes that will improve the lives of people in Scotland. We expect equality to be integrated into the delivery of those outcomes and we have included a specific outcome on tackling the significant inequalities in Scottish society. That means getting to grips with the issues for equality groups and taking action across Government.</p><p>As part of developing our understanding of the inequalities in Scotland, I have attended several events and met equality groups. I and my Cabinet colleagues the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth and the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning have also met the Equal Opportunities Committee. Those <place-holder colnum=\"8608\"/> meetings have enabled us to discuss how best to address discrimination and promote equality of opportunity.</p><p>Access to education and support for learning are vital to delivering a more successful Scotland and reducing inequality. Improved access to pre-school education benefits both child and parent. We increased the number of hours of pre-school education to 475 in August 2007 and we have announced a further increase to 570 hours from August 2010.</p><p>Our abolition of the graduate endowment fee will benefit about 50,000 students&#8212;particularly those on lower incomes, such as disabled people and lone parents, most of whom are women. That will encourage participation in learning and reduce debt. Children of asylum seekers will be able to access tuition fee support and we are reviewing provision under the disabled students allowance. From 2008-09, eligible students who require the assistance of a helper will benefit from an increased allowance of up to &#163;20,000.</p><p>We have established respectme, the national anti-bullying service, and we have commissioned Learning and Teaching Scotland and LGBT Youth Scotland to produce guidance and training materials for school staff on dealing effectively with homophobic incidents.</p><p>It is unfortunate that many barriers to employment still exist for&#8212;among others&#8212;disabled people, some ethnic minority communities and women. Employment remains a reserved matter, but we are progressing activity to address those issues. We have created Skills Development Scotland, a key part of whose role is to promote and deliver equality of access and opportunity in service delivery and the wider lifelong learning landscape.</p><p>Through workforce plus, we are developing a framework and standards to provide better opportunities for those with a disability. We are working with local organisations to address the needs of clients with mental illness and we are working to understand better the labour market challenges that ethnic minority communities face. We are making &#163;9 million available over three years to progress the strategy on English for speakers of other languages.</p><p>Poverty and deprivation will be addressed as part of our economic strategy. Anti-poverty work will be an important means of advancing equality. In our consultation on tackling poverty, we have highlighted the gendered nature of poverty and sought views on the implications for other groups.</p><p>As part of the local government settlement, we are providing &#163;145 million per annum for a fairer Scotland fund to tackle poverty and to help more people to access and sustain employment <place-holder colnum=\"8609\"/> opportunities. We expect community planning partnerships to take into account equality issues and to involve communities, including key equality groups, in strategic investment of the fund.</p><p>Concern is shared about health inequalities and we have established a ministerial task force to identify what more needs to be done; it will consider poverty and inequality as part of its work. The continuing work to achieve a healthier Scotland is being progressed through the better health, better care programme.</p><p>We will provide &#163;97 million over the next three years to abolish prescription charges. That will benefit everyone but will particularly benefit those who suffer from long-term conditions&#8212;the previous Government's disability working group highlighted that issue.</p><p>Additional funds of &#163;16 million will be provided to modernise and redesign national health service wheelchair and seating services and &#163;64 million will be provided for the prevention, screening and early detection of serious illnesses, which includes a new immunisation programme to protect women against cervical cancer.</p><p>Proposed legislative changes will benefit equality groups. We support the hate crime bill proposal that Patrick Harvie MSP has lodged, because we believe that no one should be victimised because of their sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.</p><p>We recently consulted on proposals to reform the law on rape and other sexual offences and we expect to introduce a bill on those matters in 2008.</p><p>An investment of &#163;1.5 billion is being made in new and better housing in areas throughout Scotland, including deprived areas. Every new-build house that is funded through the Scottish Government must be built to be usable for people with disabilities or mobility problems and to be adaptable to cope with any further deterioration of a person's abilities.</p><p>We know that transport is a key issue for disabled people, so we continue to support nationwide concessionary fares for people who are over 60, disabled people and young people, with &#163;181.4 million in 2008-09.</p><p>We are negotiating with local authorities on their single outcome agreements. Like the Scottish Government, local authorities are bound by the duty to secure best value and the public sector equality duties, which we expect them to reflect in their single outcome agreements.</p><p>Across the range of work that we undertake, we expect equality to be integrated and our policies to be equality impact assessed. An increasing number of assessments&#8212;21 to date&#8212;have now been published. Those include assessments on <place-holder colnum=\"8610\"/> the right to adapt for private tenants, which benefits disabled occupants in the private rented sector who need work on their house to make it suitable for their accommodation, welfare or employment; on the Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill, which I mentioned; and on the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill&#8212;that assessment highlighted several issues that will need to be considered in the delivery of the games.</p><p>We are fulfilling our responsibility to equality impact assess our policies not only because that is a legal requirement, but because it will help us to realise our outcomes. Assessing the impact on equality groups of our policies will enable us to develop policy that responds to people's different needs and to distribute appropriately the resources that are allocated in the budget.</p><p>We are committed to implementing effectively the EQIA process throughout Government, so we are working to improve the evidence base and the equality data that are available; to provide staff with support to undertake impact assessments; and to improve our ability to monitor progress through the business planning tool and certificate of assurance processes.</p><p>Mainstreaming equality is one element of the work that the &#163;61 million that is allocated for equality will support. That represents a significant increase in funding. In the context of the tightest settlement since devolution, that is another strong indicator of our commitment.</p><p>With that resource, we will tackle issues of race equality, including those for Gypsies/Travellers. I will say more on that following the finalisation of our funding decisions. We will support work to integrate refugees, asylum seekers and new migrants; to promote interfaith activity; and to challenge sectarianism and religious intolerance. We will progress the work in relation to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, including support for transgender work, and we will respond to the report of the LGBT hearts and minds agenda group in the summer. We will also advance our work on British Sign Language and linguistic access and on independent living for disabled people. Those matters deserve specific attention and I intend to provide more detail on our proposals before the summer recess.</p><p>Our money will also support a range of key organisations that deliver in the equality field, help to challenge negative attitudes&#8212;through our one Scotland and domestic abuse campaigns, for example&#8212;and support implementation of the public sector equality duties.</p><p>Gender issues that are evident in pay, occupational segregation and violence will be part of our programme. In particular, we are dedicating <place-holder colnum=\"8611\"/> &#163;44.54 million to tackling violence against women. That will provide support for key national organisations, the rape crisis network, helplines and 73 local projects throughout Scotland; fund women's aid groups throughout Scotland to provide crucial support for children and young people who are affected by domestic abuse; contribute to implementation of the national delivery plan; and fund partner support work, which is a key part of effective perpetrator programmes This is an important time for equality work&#8212;we have the advent of a new legislative framework, the new Equality and Human Rights Commission and key issues to address. It is an appropriate time for us to shape the next phase of progressing equality in Scotland. We intend to have our new approach ready in 2009, which marks the Parliament's 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. We look forward to working with the commission, all our partners, equality stakeholders, communities and&#8212;of course&#8212;the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13660086", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Equality and Diversity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In November 2007, we accepted an amendment to motion S3M-928 that asked us to make a statement on how our commitments on equality and diversity would be delivered through the Scottish budget.

That will be welcomed by people who are interested in the area, particularly in Glasgow. I will publish that information and advice as soon as it is available, and certainly by the end of May.</p><p>From the first days in power, the Government has recognised the scale of the challenge facing Scotland's housing system. Last June, in a statement to the Parliament, I described that challenge and drew attention to two particular problems. The first of those problems was the failure over many years to build enough houses across all tenures, which had left thousands of families in temporary accommodation and many more unable to find affordable housing that met their needs. The second problem was the arrangements for subsidising new social housing, which were unsustainable and in desperate need of reform. Those were and are huge challenges, but we moved quickly to address them. After only one month in office, I announced the creation of a housing supply task force to tackle obstacles to <place-holder colnum=\"8372\"/> more homes being built in urban and rural areas, such as land supply and planning issues that hamper the delivery of more housing.</p><p>In October 2007 we launched \"Firm Foundations\", which proposed a radical and ambitious package of reforms intended to improve how every part of our housing system operates. At the heart of \"Firm Foundations\" was our recognition that supply across all tenures must be increased substantially and, on the back of that, our proposal for a step change in the rate of house building from the inadequate rate of 25,000 houses a year to at least 35,000 a year by the middle of the next decade. Set against the backdrop of that reform of the planning system is the action of a Government that is determined to address the recent undersupply of housing, which we must tackle to allow our economy to flourish.</p><p>The household projections that are published today, which show increasing numbers of households over the next 25 years, simply underline the vital importance of our housing supply objectives. Crucially, for a Government that is committed to sustainable growth, the ambition to improve supply was cast clearly in terms of all new building being of a higher design and environmental standard.</p><p>We have proposed launching a sustainable communities initiative to encourage the development of new sustainable developments that are sympathetic to Scotland's landscape and environment. We recognise the central role of home ownership and the difficulties that face those who wish to buy their own home. At a strategic level, increased housing supply in line with our ambitions will act to improve affordability for house buyers&#8212;from those who are entering the market for the first time to families that are moving to meet changing circumstances.</p><p>We are committed to providing affordable housing to buy directly through our investment programmes. Our low-cost initiative for first-time buyers does exactly that. Among other initiatives, LIFT includes shared equity schemes that deliver value for taxpayers' money and grants for rural areas, in recognition of the unique circumstances that rural home buyers often face.</p><p>At the same time, we took full account of the need for a thriving social sector that can adapt to changing demand and offer more choice to those who cannot afford&#8212;or who do not wish&#8212;to buy. That included a new and positive role for local authorities as landlords, with a proposal to offer them a financial incentive to build new houses; a proposal to safeguard all new social housing by removing it from the scope of right to buy; proposals for getting better value for our social housing subsidies; and proposals for modernising regulation to ensure that it is more sharply focused <place-holder colnum=\"8373\"/> on serving the interests of existing and future tenants.</p><p>We envisaged a greater role for the private rented sector&#8212;encouraging it to flourish and play a full role in meeting housing needs in urban and rural areas and offering choice and flexibility to those who are in housing need. As \"Firm Foundations\" made clear, that included improving standards in the private rented sector through measures such as the mandatory private landlord registration scheme, and the new repairing standard. The latest figures show that the Government has achieved a 500 per cent increase in the rate of application approvals for the landlord registration scheme in the past 12 months, with the national approval figure now standing at 75 per cent. That is against an increase of 25 per cent in the number of applications received since last May. \"A long-overdue success\" was how one commentator in <em>The Herald</em> last week hailed the progress that the SNP has made in delivering the scheme.</p><p>Last week I launched Landlord Accreditation Scotland, a new company owned by the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association and the Scottish Association of Landlords. With start-up funding from the Government, the company will deliver the national voluntary landlord accreditation scheme, which aims to recognise and reward those landlords who are already maintaining their properties to good standards and thus providing tenants with peace of mind.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13648650", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing Needs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am responding to a previous intervention.

Today, of course, is 1 May, which is May day&#8212;and international workers day. The Labour Party in Scotland has decided to recognise the day by fighting tooth and nail in defence of the arch-Thatcherite policy of selling off council houses. Generations of comrades must be proud as they watch Wendy Alexander's new socialist party stand shoulder to shoulder with the Tory party in defence of Thatcherism. However, before Labour decided to come to the aid of the Tories in opposing the end of the right to buy for new-build social housing, perhaps it should have checked who it was up against.</p><p>On one side of the argument are those who oppose abolition of the right to buy for new-build social housing, such as the Labour Party, the Tory party and&#8212;actually, that is about it. That is the complete list of those who oppose the policy. However, in favour of our policy to abolish the right to buy for new-build social housing, we have local authorities, big and small housing associations, housing lobby groups such as Shelter and housing commentators. In fact, the whole housing sector approves our policy. It even won support from a certain Wendy Alexander. <em>The Herald</em> of 22 October 2007 stated:<place-holder colnum=\"8127\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"The abolition of the right to buy council houses came a step closer yesterday after ... Wendy Alexander indicated that her party would look favourably on proposals by the government.\"</p><p>I do not know whether the Labour party is coming or going on this issue. Unfortunately, neither does it.</p><p>Robert Brown asked how much will be spent on housing over the spending review period. Robert, perhaps you should have checked&#8212;I am sorry. Perhaps the member should have checked the budget. Over &#163;1.5 billion will be spent over the spending review period, which is an increase of &#163;131 million on the previous Executive's plans. That is a 19 per cent increase over the next spending review period versus the 2005-08 plans. It is clear that much more money is going into housing over the next three years.</p><p>I thought the speeches of Stuart McMillan and Jamie Hepburn were good. They clearly expressed the supply problems that we face. David McLetchie and others said that the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory policies on housing are a huge success, but still talked about the crisis that housing faces, particularly the social rented housing sector. Their policies cannot have been a huge success, given the housing crisis that we face today. It is clearly the case that this is a huge inherited problem, which we now have to face up to.</p><p>David Whitton talked about the homelessness crisis in his area&#8212;what a success his party's policies have been over the past few years. He talked about \"dodgy\" documents. I will take no lessons from the Labour Party on dodgy documents. We know fine well about dodgy documents from the Labour Party; it has had far too many over the past few years.</p><p>Margaret Curran talked about the fact that there has been no statement to Parliament. As I said, there will be a statement to Parliament in the coming weeks. We have said that that will happen, and we will ensure that it will happen. On the discussion about the &#163;25 million for new council houses, that is but one policy on housing&#8212;it is not the only policy on housing&#8212;and it has been widely welcomed. We are in negotiation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities as to exactly how that policy will be implemented.</p><p>Both Johann Lamont and David Whitton talked about the dire, desperate, doom-and-gloom housing situation and the collapse of the housing association movement&#8212;I think that that sums up their views on our proposals. However, just this week, the Scottish Housing Regulator's financial digest published the fact that housing associations have cash deposits in excess of &#163;300 million, and a gross surplus of &#163;113 million. There is clearly not a crisis in, or a collapse of, the housing <place-holder colnum=\"8128\"/> association sector.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis said that our proposal will cause rents to rise. It will not, because the changes that we are making reflect exactly the performance that housing associations have reported to the Government. Therefore, our proposals are exactly in line with those of the housing associations.</p><p>Cathie Craigie welcomed the fact that the Conservative party had chosen to use its debating time to discuss housing and claimed that the Government had not had any housing debates. I gently point out to her that we had a housing debate in the Parliament in the first month of our Government, in June 2007. Our second housing debate took place in October 2007. We will have another debate or statement very soon. We will have had three housing debates in our first year in Government, whereas Labour failed to have a housing debate in the Parliament in its first year in Government either in 1999 or 2003.</p><p>I ask members to support the amendment in my name.

That means respecting tenants' right to retain their local authority landlord where they vote to do so and supporting transfers where they enjoy local support. That is why, in December 2007, I was happy to approve the transfer of Inverclyde Council's stock to River Clyde Homes.</p><p>Under current Treasury rules on debt write-off, deciding against a transfer has serious implications for future investment in stock. We believe that the rules are unfair and penalise tenants who choose to remain with their local authority landlords, which is why we asked the Treasury to consider write-off where transfers do not take place. I regret that the Treasury was not prepared to contemplate flexibility in the interests of supporting tenants and respecting their right to choose. As matters stand, we must live with the Treasury's intransigence&#8212;we do not have the powers or resources to do otherwise. Perhaps other members should support the transfer of the powers, rather than moan about the fact that the Treasury will not agree.</p><p>Local authority tenants suffer the consequences of reduced investment in their homes. That is unsatisfactory. We made it clear in \"Firm Foundations: The Future of Housing in Scotland\" that we would consider proposals for full or partial transfers, particularly where they qualify for debt write-off. However, we will not press tenants&#8212;some might say bribe or blackmail them&#8212;into voting for a course that they do not believe is in their best interests. At root, the Tories are dogmatically opposed to local authorities being landlords, and that antipathy lies behind their motion. We do not share their antipathy&#8212;quite the opposite; we acknowledge that local authorities continue to play a large role in providing social housing, and we want to support them in that role.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Nicola Sturgeon announced &#163;25 million for the next three years to kick-start a new generation of council house building, and we will soon announce the housing association grant allocations for 2008-09. Our proposal has been widely welcomed, with the huge majority of respondents to \"Firm Foundations\" expressing clear support for it. It is easy to see why. There is an acute shortage of affordable housing to rent. The policies of previous Administrations have not been a huge success, as David McLetchie claimed. Our support for local authority house building will help to address that shortage by encouraging councils to start building again. We will discuss with our partners in the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities how the money can be used to best effect by encouraging local authorities to augment, as cost effectively as <place-holder colnum=\"8109\"/> possible, the supply of new social housing in areas of need.</p><p>It is worth stressing the point about augmenting new supply. The Tory motion implies that we undervalue or are somehow trying to undermine housing associations and other not-for-profit and co-operative housing bodies, but that is quite simply not the case. We acknowledge that the not-for-profit sector has made a huge contribution to the provision of high-quality, affordable homes across the country and to the regeneration of communities and neighbourhoods.</p><p>We were clear in \"Firm Foundations\" that we expect the not-for-profit sector to continue to supply the great majority of new social housing. We need the sector to thrive and grow as a key player in a housing system that is much more responsive to demand for affordable housing across all tenures. Unlike the Tories and the Labour Party, we have no difficulty in contemplating a world where the not-for-profit sector and local authorities both help to create a system that better meets Scotland's housing needs.

We have engaged with COSLA on the issue. I have not yet met COSLA representatives specifically to discuss sport, but such a meeting has been set up and will take place in the near future. In the meantime, officials have met COSLA on a regular basis to discuss a number of issues. I have also met the education ministers to ensure that we work together across the Government to make sport happen.</p><p>In the past couple of weeks, the First Minister has made it clear that there is no change to the target of providing two hours of PE a week in schools. It is clear that we are determined to increase the level of physical activity in schools. Soon we will launch the obesity action plan, which will cover issues such as physical activity and <place-holder colnum=\"8087\"/> healthy eating. The national and regional facilities strategy has been mentioned. Not only is the strategy still in place, but we have made the first announcements concerning the legacy of the 2014 Commonwealth games for other parts of Scotland. We have announced &#163;5 million to assist the development of a 50m pool in Aberdeen and an additional &#163;1 for the refurbishment of the royal Commonwealth pool in Edinburgh. Many further announcements will be made in the coming years.</p><p>Bill Aitken asked specifically about the budget. The big difference between the situation in Glasgow and the situation in London, where the 2012 Olympics will be held, is that less than 20 per cent of the budget for the 2014 Commonwealth games is for capital expenditure. The budget is robust, has been developed over time and includes a substantial contingency element, so spending is on target. The chamber, parliamentary committees and others will be kept informed as we progress. The organising committee of the games, which has been formed as a company, is responsible for reporting annually, at least, to the Parliament on its activities and progress.</p><p>Bill Aitken and other members mentioned ticket touting. The UK Government has only just made public how it intends to deal with that issue; we will respond to its announcement shortly. The point that the member made about other sports was important. A number of sports besides football are important to a large number of people. I am particularly pleased that rugby sevens will play a part in the 2014 Commonwealth games and look forward to attending that event.</p><p>The only discordant note this afternoon was struck by Jim Tolson, who I thought would never get to the bill in his speech. He hit a sour note when he talked about so-called cuts in local government budgets. Let us go over the figures. The fact is that local government has secured not only an increased amount of money but an increased share of the Government budget during the next few years&#8212;its share is going up, whereas it had been going down during the past few years. Jim Tolson's remarks were unfortunate and inaccurate.</p><p>The total relocation costs for sportscotland are &#163;7.9 million. I gently point out to Jim Tolson that if his party had still been in power along with the Labour Party, Lib-Lab plans for the relocation of sportscotland would have cost &#163;15 million, which would have come out of money for sport. The &#163;7.9 million costs represent a huge saving for sport in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403311", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Absolutely.

It was a tense time, which resulted from a great deal of hard work, much of the credit for which must go to all those who were involved, across all parties, in the Parliament and Glasgow City Council, as well as those on the bid team and the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland.</p><p>It is fitting that the bill has passed through the Parliament in a spirit of co-operation. Its progress, and the speed at which we have been able to reach this stage, shows what can be achieved when Scotland comes together around one objective.</p><p>We have made a lot of progress in those few, short months. Since 9 November, we have established the organising committee as a company to run the games. The company now has a chairman in Sir Robert Smith and a chief executive in John Scott. The company board met for the first time last week. We have published a legacy consultation and set up a legacy board to ensure that the games provide lasting benefit for the people of Glasgow and people throughout Scotland. We have also made significant progress on the bill. When it was introduced on 9 November, there was broad consensus in the Parliament and in Scotland on the policy aims, but some issues still needed to be addressed. The policy aims remain unchanged. The bill will protect the games from ticket touting, so that everyone in Scotland can enjoy the events at a fair price. The games will be commercially attractive, but they will not be cluttered by unofficial or unsuitable trading and advertising.</p><p>Mr McGrigor raised a point earlier about branded venues near games venues, with which I do not think I dealt. His point is a matter for the regulations. I am sure that he realises that the regulations will be developed pragmatically, with a view to dealing with the circumstances that he <place-holder colnum=\"8067\"/> mentioned. We will take the same approach to those venues as we will take to shop signs and other such matters.</p><p>The bill will ensure that a games transport plan is developed and implemented. Athletes and spectators will be able to travel efficiently to and from Glasgow and between venues. The bill will allow land to be bought if it is needed for the games. It is worth saying that, if the bill is passed today, we intend to commence early sections 41 and 42, which are on compulsory purchase and financial support to the organising committee.</p><p>As I did at stage 1, I thank those who have been involved in the bill process so far, including members of the Local Government and Communities Committee, the Finance Committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee; those who gave oral or written evidence; and everyone who responded to our consultation on the draft bill during the summer of last year. We have tried, as far as possible, to incorporate the views and wishes of the committees and those who offered evidence to them.</p><p>Concerns were raised at stage 1 about the enforcement provisions. We responded and introduced amendments at stage 2 to address those concerns. We clarified the role of enforcement officers by setting out who may be designated as an enforcement officer and by making it clear that the police will have recourse to the same powers that enforcement officers will have if those powers go above and beyond the normal powers of the police. We also made it clear that, although enforcement officers will at times need to be accompanied by police officers, the police will be able to enforce games regulations independently.</p><p>Today, we have had a debate about the scrutiny procedure for regulations. The Subordinate Legislation Committee had concerns about the scrutiny of any amendments to the regulations. It is worth pointing out that the committee played an important role in strengthening the scrutiny that will apply when substantive regulations are made for the first time.</p><p>Other issues were raised during the consideration of the bill. It was suggested that we might extend the ticket touting provisions to cover other sports and events. Unfortunately, that was not possible, as the scope of the bill extends only to the Commonwealth games. I have sympathy with the organisers of sporting and cultural events who regularly find tickets for their events being touted. We are considering the United Kingdom Government's response to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee report on ticket touting, which was published on 21 April. I will make an announcement soon on how we intend to respond.<place-holder colnum=\"8068\"/></p><p>Briefly, on lottery funding, we have gone on record to express our concern that &#163;150 million is being diverted from Scotland to help pay for the London 2012 Olympic games. That is manifestly unacceptable and Parliament can be assured that the Government will continue to fight with passion for a fair deal for Scotland from the lottery.</p><p>During stages 1 and 2, questions were asked about equality and access to the games. Although access to the games will be a matter for the organising committee, we have conducted a full equality impact assessment of the bill, which has been published on our website. The message from the assessment is that care will need to be taken to ensure that the transport plan, when developed, takes full account of the needs of people with mobility issues. Section 37 places a requirement on the organising committee to consult widely before developing the transport plan, and I expect that to include organisations and groups that can offer information and advice on equality and access issues.</p><p>Since the bill was introduced, public comment has been made on the risks that human traffickers will hide behind the influx of visitors to Glasgow. Detailed work will be needed nearer the time to find ways to stop the Commonwealth games being used in that way. We will be able to draw directly on the experience of the London Olympics in 2012 in that regard.</p><p>The bill sets a foundation on which we will deliver a successful games.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill be passed.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403311", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are in the chamber today to consider and, I hope, pass the bill that will enable Glasgow to host the Commonwealth games in 2014.

The siting of the banners did not fall within the definition of \"vicinity\" as meaning 200m or 300m, but nonetheless their siting impinged on the sponsorship arrangements for the match. That shows the use of ambush marketing. Clearly, the definition of \"vicinity\" is not as straightforward as drawing a circle or a line around the location of an event.</p><p>As I said, the games programme will not be finalised until closer to 2014. For that reason, we would prefer to define \"vicinity\" in the regulations.

We are grateful to the Subordinate Legislation Committee for its detailed scrutiny of the bill. It has made a number of recommendations that we have implemented during the parliamentary process and which have undoubtedly improved the bill.</p><p>Amendment 4 would place a subjective test of urgency on ministers' ability to use negative procedure when amending the advertising, street trading or internet regulations. The advertising and street trading regulations will specify where and when such activities will be prohibited during the games and will define activities that might be exempted from such controls. The internet <place-holder colnum=\"8059\"/> regulations will specify circumstances in which making internet facilities available is or is not to be capable of constituting the touting offence contained in the bill. We understand the intention of amendment 4, but we have legal concerns that it would be detrimental to the effective running of the Commonwealth games.</p><p>The amendments that have been lodged by the Subordinate Legislation Committee offer an opportunity for me to clarify how I expect the regulation-making process to operate in practice. It is the Government's intention that the first use of the regulations, which will be their substantive use, will require affirmative procedure&#8212;they cannot be made unless approved by Parliament. The Government will also be required to issue public notice of the general nature of the advertising and street trading regulations two years before the games and the detail of those regulations six months before the games.</p><p>As the Local Government and Communities Committee noted in its stage 1 report, the Government</p><p class=\"indent\">\"may need to react quickly to unforeseen circumstances in advance of the Games ... and when the Parliament is in recess.\"</p><p>For example, emergency road works could force a change in the marathon route or we could find that an organisation or individual was exploiting a loophole in our regulations. Ambush marketing is innovative by nature and those seeking to exploit the games for commercial gain have used methods at previous major events that could not have been predicted. In such circumstances the Government would have to react immediately, given the unique nature of the games, which are expected to last 11 days from 23 July to 3 August 2014.</p><p>If the Government were required to use affirmative procedure in such circumstances, it would require the recall of Parliament, which would be in recess during that period. That is not a practical proposition. Negative procedure would allow the Government to respond quickly without having to recall Parliament. Introducing a subjective test, such as the requirement to demonstrate urgency, creates legal uncertainty and could cast doubt over the validity of the regulations. They could be challenged on the ground that the matter was either not urgent or not required for the purposes set out in the amendments. The difficulty of determining urgency would be particularly acute if, near the end of the parliamentary term, the Government discovered that a change to the regulations was required, but there was a lack of available parliamentary time to enable a debate to be had on the affirmative instrument. Were negative procedure to be used in such a case, the question would be whether the <place-holder colnum=\"8060\"/> case was urgent or whether parliamentary time was not available. One does not necessarily equate to the other.</p><p>Legal certainty is particularly important when dealing with regulations that specify criminal offences and we should aim to avoid introducing any grounds for challenging either the basis on which the regulations were made or whether there has been a reasonable exercise of judgment. These amendments would require the Government to consider whether the specific circumstances met such a test. If a person affected by the regulations were to raise a challenge in the courts, it might delay or prevent any action. Given that the games are expected to last only 11 days, serious damage might be done to their image and to our reputation as a major event destination before the Government could react effectively. Moreover, a challenge to the regulations after the event could have the same effect and could be financially damaging.</p><p>Under section 44, before they make the first trading or advertising regulations, ministers will have a statutory obligation to consult</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the councils for the areas where it is proposed that the regulations apply\",</p><p>the organising committee of the games and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"other persons whom Ministers consider appropriate\".</p><p>Amendments 5 to 7 seek to require ministers to consult those persons before any subsequent trading or advertising regulations are made, unless the regulations have to be made urgently for the specified purposes. The Government is committed to consultation, unless it is not practical to do so because of time constraints such as, for example, in the event of a venue becoming unusable a week before the games. This provision is particularly relevant given that the projected games are a specific, one-off, two-week-long event.</p><p>Because the requirement to consult is a precondition for making the regulations, introducing a subjective test on whether the duty to consult applies carries with it all the problems inherent in imposing the same test on deciding which procedure to use in the first place. Given that such a move opens the regulations to legal challenges on exactly the same basis, the Government takes the view that the Subordinate Legislation Committee's proposed amendments to section 44 are as detrimental to the bill as those proposed for section 43.</p><p>In its consideration of the matters that have led to these amendments, the Subordinate Legislation Committee has expressed concern that use of the power after it is first used could be substantive and has highlighted as an example the possible need to correct errors. Although errors are always <place-holder colnum=\"8061\"/> possible, we should not lose sight of the fact that the first regulations will undergo considerable pre-legislative scrutiny and that there will be parliamentary scrutiny of the draft regulations. If any errors arise, it seems rather unlikely that the necessary corrections will have any substantive effect rather than simply address technical points.</p><p>Amendment 8 seeks to impose a duty on ministers to give notice of subsequent regulations at least two weeks before the games, unless that is impractical. Unlike the duty to consult in section 44, giving public notice is not a precondition to making the regulations but is intended to assist those who will need to comply with them. Ministers will make every effort to ensure that members of the public are made aware of such changes. As Jamie Stone suggested, our aim in the bill is to prevent unlawful acts, not to prosecute offenders. As it is in our interest to make the contents of the regulations widely available, amendment 8 merely reflects a commitment that the Government has already made.</p><p>Agreeing to the Subordinate Legislation Committee's amendments would introduce a subjective test of urgency, the determination of which could leave the regulations open to legal challenge. That would reduce the Government's ability to react to events in the period leading up to and during the games and could significantly damage Scotland's reputation as a major events destination.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13403292", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill: Stage 3: Section 43 &#8212; Orders and regulations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Jamie Stone for lodging his amendments.

It has always been our intention for the advertising regulations to be capable of exempting types of advertising from the advertising offence. Section 10 already allows the regulations to do just that. I assure Jamie McGrigor and other members that it is our intention to use the regulations to exempt, where necessary, the types of advertising that are mentioned in amendment 1. For example, if a cinema falls within the vicinity of a games location&#8212;that is one of the examples that Jamie McGrigor used&#8212;the regulations will exempt that cinema from committing an advertising offence by showing its regular pre-feature film adverts.</p><p>Amendment 2 would introduce a statutory defence to the advertising offence if the person could prove that the offence occurred without their knowledge or despite the fact that they had taken all reasonable steps to prevent it from occurring or continuing. Such a defence is contained in the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006. However, the offence to which that defence relates is framed very differently, in that it is to contravene the regulations. In our case, the offence specifically relates to advertising</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in the vicinity of a Games location at a prohibited time\".</p><p>Advertising, within the meaning of the bill, is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a communication to the public ... for the purpose of promoting\"</p><p>a product or service. The act of advertising is a positive act and each case would need to be considered on its own merits in order to determine who was actually advertising. It is therefore almost impossible to conceive of a situation where a <place-holder colnum=\"8055\"/> person could commit an offence without their knowledge.</p><p>There are some problems with amendment 2 as it has been drafted. As well as the defence being available where the person is in ignorance of the fact of advertising, the proposed provisions could be interpreted as affording a defence based on ignorance of the law. Clearly, that should be avoided.</p><p>Regulations may make further provision in relation to advertising. In this context, consideration will be given to the different scenarios that might arise. If it is considered appropriate, it would be possible to include an exemption or a defence.</p><p>Amendment 3 would introduce a defined period during which the advertising regulations would apply. As I am sure that Jamie McGrigor is aware, the games are expected to take place from 23 July to 4 August 2014. However, we cannot say with any certainty that those dates will not change. I understand that there has been some concern in the advertising industry about the duration of the advertising regulations. We are committed by the host city contract for the games to control advertising from up to two weeks before the games begin.

Those are defined as places in which events are held as part of the games, or other places specified by ministers and used in connection with the games.

We brought a housing debate within a few weeks of coming to power and we see housing as a major priority for the Government. Our top priority is of course the creation of a successful country with opportunities for all Scotland to flourish through increasing sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Perhaps I should remind Parliament where we found ourselves last May. For a number of years, property prices had been rising at an alarming rate, which was making it difficult for many people to become home owners. Average house prices had risen by 72 per cent in only four years, while the increase in house building under the previous <place-holder colnum=\"7133\"/> Administration was of only 2 per cent over the same period. Not enough houses were being built. Put simply, far too many people in Scotland were finding it difficult, if not impossible, to satisfy the basic aspiration of having a decent home that they could afford in a place where they wanted to live.</p><p>It was clear that we had been left a legacy of housing problems that had built up over many years of neglect. In the months since May, the Government has made it clear that increasing the housing supply in all tenures&#8212;I make no apology for including all tenures&#8212;is key to meeting our nation's housing needs. We want a significant increase in house building throughout the country that creates vibrant, mixed, environmentally sustainable communities.</p><p>In \"Firm Foundations\", we quantified our house-building aspirations by proposing that national building rates should be increased to at least 35,000 each year by the middle of the next decade. That is not tinkering with policy but a major shift in what we seek from our house-building industry.</p><p>The proposal aims to change totally current approaches to development. Our ambition has been widely welcomed. Earlier this month, <em>Building </em>magazine reported:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"since the SNP seized power, Scotland's construction industry has been bursting with optimism ... the feeling from developers and house-builders in Scotland is palpably different to that in England.\"</p><p>We need to nurture that confidence and draw on it to address the supply crisis in which we find ourselves.</p><p>\"Firm Foundations\" sets out the framework in which we have pressed forward on several fronts in recent months.

By helping tenants of housing associations <place-holder colnum=\"7134\"/> and local authorities to achieve home ownership, the pilot can help to relieve pressure on the stretched rented sector.</p><p>To respond to the housing pressures in rural areas, we announced just last month that we will establish a scheme to enable rural landowners to apply for housing grants to help them to build new affordable homes on their land. The &#163;5 million that we will direct to that pilot scheme could improve the sustainability of some of our more fragile rural communities.</p><p>The housing supply task force that we created last summer, and which I chair, represents a fresh approach to tackling obstacles, such as land supply and planning issues, that have hampered the delivery of sufficient housing. Far from lacking a remit or an inclination to make a difference, as the Labour Party's motion implies, the task force has made steady progress over the winter, as a glance at the papers on its web pages confirms.</p><p>The task force brings together a diverse range of housing supply interests and has dug into the detail of what affects housing delivery around the country. The task force's focus is&#8212;rightly&#8212;on delivery rather than report writing and I am determined that, through its actions, it will begin to unpick obstacles that have got in the way of development. We will issue a public statement next month about what we have learned from our work so far and how we propose to proceed in the months ahead.</p><p>Finally, I will deal with investment in our social housing stock. We have to tackle our predecessors' failure to secure value for public investment in social housing. It has been clear for years that demand for social housing far exceeds supply and that the cost to the public purse of delivering new stock is growing unsustainably. Others might have been content to ignore those hard facts, but we are not, because doing nothing denies families the homes that they desperately need.</p><p>We are determined to obtain much better value for our investment and&#8212;crucially&#8212;to do so while retaining the strengths and benefits of Scotland's unique mix of housing associations, including community-controlled associations and co-operatives. To achieve that, we propose to identify through a competitive process a few lead developers to undertake all new social housing developments in a given area over a number of years.</p><p>The developers will build not simply for themselves, but to meet the need of other associations&#8212;including community-controlled associations and co-operatives&#8212;to acquire new stock. They will build the stock, but community associations will own and manage it. We will save <place-holder colnum=\"7135\"/> money by proceeding in that way.

It had plenty of opportunity to do so, but it did not, so Labour members should not come <place-holder colnum=\"6936\"/> moaning to us when we are thinking about it.</p><p>I have had robust discussions with the energy companies on a number of matters that are extremely important to us all. It remains the case that the UK Government has responsibility, so I would welcome James Kelly's support for us in ensuring that the powers are devolved to this Parliament, so that we can have robust discussions and take firm action when necessary.</p><p>Robert Brown mentioned renewables. The renewables pilot is ongoing and will report in the summer. We will respond at that point.

In that letter, they said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In our view, the current programmes are not targeted effectively at fuel-poor households and are failing in their primary goal of eradicating fuel poverty. Ineffective targeting means that there are recipients of the programmes, in particular the central heating programme, who are not necessarily fuel poor.\"</p><p>That is one of the reasons why we instigated a review of fuel poverty. We want to find out whether, after seven years, the programmes are delivering.

I will raise a number of matters at the summit, including the issue that Liam McArthur raised.</p><p>Of course, the basic flaw in the political settlement is that it divides responsibility for these interconnected factors. As a result, too many of our households are left struggling to have a warm home. I see that as a key area for debate in the national conversation. In taking on the challenge of the fuel poverty target, we are maximising our impact on the factors that are not under our direct control. At the same time, we must ensure that we enable energy efficiency measures to maximise their impact on fuel poverty. We will do that by making the most effective use of our investment in the fuel poverty programmes. We will support that effort by maximising other opportunities for all householders to reduce their fuel costs.</p><p>I will give some examples. As Liam McArthur said, the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change announced on 4 March a consultation on reforming the planning system to encourage greater use of microgeneration equipment. The Sullivan report \"A Low Carbon Buildings Standards Strategy for Scotland\" sets out a route towards zero carbon new buildings. We are also funding a dedicated worker in the Energy Saving Trust to ensure that Scotland gets its fair share of funding for insulation from energy suppliers through their carbon emissions reduction targets.</p><p>Last week, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and I met many of the key stakeholders in tackling fuel poverty. We discussed how to reinvigorate the debate on fuel poverty and move forward in the most constructive way. We heard that the industry forum had not gone as far as stakeholders had hoped it would. Many said that they were disappointed with progress and felt that the forum had nothing more to offer. However, it is clear that there is much to discuss around how we can take things forward. We will continue those discussions. We are impressed by and welcome the stakeholders' appetite for a fresh start on the challenge to reach the 2016 target. As part of that wider debate, I also welcome this opportunity to <place-holder colnum=\"6916\"/> hear members' views on what more can and should be done to tackle fuel poverty.</p><p>As I have discussed with the Local Government and Communities Committee, an internal review of fuel poverty work is being undertaken to take stock of what has been achieved to date, so that we can consider how to make improvements.

However, if we put that aside, I am sure that we all agree that the debate has been constructive and consensual. I thank members not only for listening to the debate, but for their constructive comments on how we should proceed. Today's debate has continued the spirit of collaboration that marked the successful bidding process and the spirit of co-operation that was present in the initial committee scrutiny of the bill. I pay tribute to the previous ministers who were involved and the previous Administration, which took forward the matter between 2003 and 2007. On such matters, it is important that we rise above party politics and agree to work together for the benefit of Scotland.</p><p>I will cover as many as I can of the points that were made in the debate. Kenneth Gibson made a number of points on behalf of the Local Government and Communities Committee. First, he raised the concerns of the advertising industry. We are committed to consulting widely with the advertising industry and we will ensure that, during the consultation on advertising regulations, its views are taken on board. However, we must ensure that advertising is legal and fit for purpose. We made a commitment to the Commonwealth Games Federation that we will protect the brand of the Commonwealth games, and we will do so. It is not only for the benefit of the federation but for the benefit of the Glasgow games that we will make regulations to ensure that the brand is protected.</p><p>The destruction power that was mentioned is not a widespread power but is limited to advertising. A similar power is available to local authority planning officials under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997.<place-holder colnum=\"6365\"/></p><p>Kenneth Gibson went on to talk about a number of other things, including street trading. Several other members raised that issue, too. He was correct to say that section 2 of the bill does not create an offence in relation to indoor traders. The Commonwealth Games Federation requires us to control outdoor trading in the vicinity of the games. We have no reason&#8212;nor do we have any desire&#8212;to want shops or other indoor traders to stop trading. They will still be regulated by the laws that deal with trading in Glasgow.</p><p>Kenneth Gibson said that an association right is not necessary. That is a matter for the UK Parliament because it is reserved, but officials will meet the Advertising Association next week to listen to its concerns on that point.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee wants annual updates on the games, including on broadcasting revenue. I confirm that we will provide that information to the committee and the rest of the Parliament.</p><p>Frank McAveety talked about internet trading and about eBay in particular. We do not underestimate the challenge that we face in gaining the co-operation of internet services and ensuring that internet service providers comply with the spirit of the games. That is why we will draft internet regulations nearer the date of the games, taking account of the views of eBay and other services and of developments in a rapidly changing technology. We must accept that the technology changes almost week by week. There is no point in dealing with it now when a completely different set of regulations will be required nearer the games.</p><p>A number of members, including Stuart McMillan and James Kelly, talked about ticket touting, which is an important issue. Frank McAveety also asked about prevention of ticket touting outside Scotland. The bill clearly cannot create an offence in other jurisdictions, but it will ensure that those who engage in touting outwith Scotland, using computer systems located in other countries for example, will commit an offence under Scots law. We are working with the UK Government to extend the offence throughout the United Kingdom through a section 104 order under the Scotland Act 1998.</p><p>Jamie McGrigor asked about consultation with disability groups, particularly on the transport plan. We will consult disability groups&#8212;I can make that commitment clear and simple. As section 37(2)(c) says, we want to ensure that everyone is consulted</p><p class=\"indent\">\"whom the Organising Committee considers appropriate.\"</p><p>We do not want to list organisations, but we expect that to involve disability groups. I can make <place-holder colnum=\"6366\"/> that commitment to Jamie McGrigor and the other members who raised the issue.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson asked about co-operation with the London organising committee of the Olympic games. We are continuing to co-operate with LOCOG; indeed, my officials have a meeting with it tomorrow to discuss a number of issues on which we want to co-operate and the benefits that we want to gain from the lessons that it will learn in organising the 2012 Olympic games in London. That official-level engagement will continue, and we will also engage at ministerial level as time moves on.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson was concerned about spectators with a disability. We will ensure that there is full consultation about access for disabled spectators.</p><p>Many members mentioned the lottery and legacy issue. The legacy is dealt with in the consultation document that we published on 15 February. I point members, including Robert Brown, to pages 36 and 37 of that document, which cover many of the issues that he raised.</p><p>The advertisement for the chair of sportscotland was in the press last Friday, and the appointment will follow the normal public appointments process.</p><p>Several members asked about trading within the vicinity, and Sandra White in particular raised the question of compulsory purchase orders. The bill provides for those orders to make absolutely sure that we can get access to the ground that is required to deliver the games. Compulsory purchase orders are a normal process for local authorities. They are a process of last resort, but it is necessary to ensure that they are in place just in case we require to use them.</p><p>Sandra White asked about procurement and business opportunities. Officials are already talking to local businesses and chambers of commerce. Derek Casey is going round a number of chambers of commerce to give presentations on the business opportunities that will be provided by the 2014 games.</p><p>Bob Doris said that we want to bottle the feel-good factor of the 9 November announcement. I could not agree more, and that is what the legacy document is all about&#8212;whether it is in facilities or participation rates.</p><p>Johann Lamont referred to equalities and the trafficking of women. That is an extremely important point, and we will ensure that we deal with the issues as we make progress with the bill and other arrangements for the games.</p><p>Let me say in conclusion how heartening it has been to be part of the debate and to hear words of encouragement from many members. Our progress in securing the games and developing <place-holder colnum=\"6367\"/> the bill and the plans for a lasting legacy have been impressive. It shows what we can achieve if we all work together&#8212;the people of Scotland coming together to work for the benefit of Scotland. That is what we want to see, and I am sure that it is what members throughout the chamber want to see.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399029", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It was all going so well until Frank McAveety mentioned passing back the baton.

Plans for the legacy are set out in the consultation document that we launched recently. I urge members and their constituents to engage in that process. However, today's item of business&#8212;the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill&#8212;is about meeting the legislative commitments in our bid.</p><p>The bill will protect the games from ticket touting so that everyone in Scotland can enjoy the events at a fair price. The games will be commercially attractive, but they will not be cluttered by unofficial or unsuitable trading and advertising. The bill will ensure that a games transport plan is developed and implemented, so that athletes and spectators will be able to travel to and from Glasgow and between venues efficiently. The bill will also allow land to be bought if it is needed for the games.</p><p>I thank those involved in the bill's progress so far&#8212;members of the Local Government and Communities Committee, the Finance Committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee and those who gave oral or written evidence. I also thank everyone who responded to our consultation on the draft bill last summer.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee welcomed the bill in its stage 1 report. It said that the bill contained</p><p class=\"indent\">\"appropriate measures for the delivery of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games\"</p><p>and recommended that the Parliament approve its general principles.</p><p>However, the committee raised some specific issues, some of which I would like to address at this point. The report asked why we need to protect the games from ambush marketing. Major sporting events attract large audiences. They have positive values associated with their brand and sponsors pay significant sums to associate their <place-holder colnum=\"6333\"/> goods or services with that brand. Ambush marketing aims to benefit from the games without contributing to the costs of the event. The bill will address unauthorised advertising or marketing in and around an event. We also want to prevent ambush marketers from creating an association in people's minds between the games and a particular brand. Policy on intellectual property is reserved under the Scotland Act 1998, so we are working with the United Kingdom to prohibit such activities. The provisions will mirror the protection that has been put in place for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.</p><p>The committee suggested that we might extend the ticket touting provisions in the bill to cover other sports and events. I have sympathy with sporting bodies or organisers of music events whose tickets are resold for greatly inflated prices. However, the bill is designed solely to deliver the Commonwealth games. It would not be appropriate for it to make such general provisions, which in any case would require proper consultation.</p><p>The committee was concerned that the benefits of the games could be undermined if compulsory purchase caused businesses to close and jobs to be lost. Local authorities already have a wide range of compulsory purchase powers. However, given the nature of the games and the potential time pressures, we decided to put such a power in the bill for the avoidance of any doubt. The relocation of displaced businesses would be a matter for the council exercising the compulsory purchase power.</p><p>The committee sought assurances that current licensed street traders would not lose out. We do not know who those individuals will be until the regulations are made much closer to when the games take place. However, section 8 requires councils to work with existing traders to try to identify alternative trading arrangements if they are prevented from trading by the bill.</p><p>The committee highlighted issues that have been raised by policing bodies about the enforcement provisions. My officials have recently met the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to discuss its concerns. The meeting was positive, and I will bring forward amendments at stage 2 to address police concerns.</p><p>There has also been concern about who will take on the role of enforcement officers. It is important that enforcement officers are experienced and credible people. That is why the bill allows trading standards officers to be designated as enforcement officers. It also allows regulations to set other criteria for enforcement officers that might seem sensible nearer the time.<place-holder colnum=\"6334\"/></p><p>The report asked us to consider the recommendations of the Subordinate Legislation Committee. That committee felt that the power to designate games events was too broadly drawn. I agree, which is why we will lodge an amendment at stage 2 to require a designated games event to have a connection with the Commonwealth games. The committee was concerned that negative procedure was proposed for the regulations dealing with advertising, street trading and use of the internet. We will therefore lodge an amendment at stage 2 to require affirmative procedure for the first substantive use of those powers and negative procedure thereafter. We have left negative procedure for subsequent use in order to give flexibility to react to events leading up to and during the games. If, for example, the trading regulations were not having their intended effect, we would have to react quickly to protect the games. As the games are likely to take place during the summer recess, it would not be practical to make further regulations by affirmative procedure&#8212;I am sure that members would rather be watching the games than attending a Parliament that has been recalled just to consider small changes to those regulations. We are also planning to amend the bill to allow such urgent regulations to be made without the normal consultation and notice period.</p><p>The committee recommended that we restrict the use of the enforcement regulations to the appointment of enforcement officers and the process and jurisdiction for compensation. However, there is extensive provision for the enforcement of games offences in the bill that those regulations could not undermine. Therefore we do not propose to amend the bill to restrict the use of that power.</p><p>The report also considered that the meaning of the term \"vicinity\" should be defined at an early opportunity and that that should take into account the practical issues surrounding games events. The issue relates to the physical space in which unauthorised advertising and street trading will be prohibited. The regulations will define the places and times in which such measures will take effect. They are likely to apply restrictions for different periods in a different way for different events, depending on the nature of the event, on sightlines for control of advertising and on site layout for trading. The issue is not as simple as drawing a line a set distance around a building. Further, as the final games programme will not be finalised until closer to 2014, it makes sense to define \"vicinity\" in the regulations, which will use affirmative procedure for their first substantive use.</p><p>Finally, the report recommended that we seek lottery funding to run the games in order to allow more money to be invested in grass-roots sport. The First Minister has made it clear that we will not <place-holder colnum=\"6335\"/> look for lottery funding to replace public investment that has already been set aside to meet direct games costs. However, we are keen to engage with lottery distributors to see how lottery money can help to create a lasting legacy from the games.</p><p>However, Scotland stands to lose out on as much as &#163;150 million of its share of lottery money because the UK Government is using it to support the London Olympics. We are pressing the UK Government to release that &#163;150 million so that we can discuss how it could be used to support grass-roots sport and community projects, which will help us to make the most of the opportunities that Glasgow 2014 presents us with.</p><p>The bill sets a foundation on which we will deliver a successful games. I have listened to the views that were expressed during our consultation over the summer and during the parliamentary scrutiny of the bill since its introduction. The bill has evolved in response to those views and will continue to do so at stage 2. I am keen to carry the political consensus that secured our successful bid into the delivery of the games.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399029", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "While we are here today to consider the principles of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill, it is worth noting at the outset that the games have the potential to inspire long-term change throughout Scotland by allowing us to develop new skills, improve people's health and reap the full benefit of the global coverage of Glasgow, and Scotland, hosting a major international sporting event.

As with many members' business debates, I was interested to hear about members' lives and experiences as children. Everyone seems to have visited many football clubs but, as John Park said, no one ever seems to have gone to see Rangers or Celtic. That is just one of those funny things that often crops up.</p><p>As I have spoken before in this chamber of my respect for Supporters Direct in Scotland's good work in developing and increasing the number of football trusts throughout Scotland, I am happy to repeat my belief that such organisations can play a fundamental and principled role in football.</p><p>Supporters Direct in Scotland has invested considerable hard work and effort in establishing supporters trusts, which are developing clubs as assets to local communities and promoting corporate governance, financial accountability and community responsibility. As football clubs are well known in their communities, they can help to attract people to attend events as spectators and to get more involved as volunteers. Indeed, such local support is crucial to any football club.</p><p>We are all aware of the passion of Scottish football fans for the game and their pride in their team's achievements and know that supporters are the lifeblood of Scottish football. Anyone who has been to a football match knows the importance of the relationship between the players on the pitch and the spectators in the stands, and the same holds true not only for old firm games but for local derbies between, say, Kilmarnock and Ayr, which I believe are quite exciting events. Indeed, I am sure that Ms Jamieson has been to many such derbies.</p><p>At its best, that bond between players and supporters can inspire both and create a memorable sense of occasion. I experienced that most recently at the UEFA cup group match between Aberdeen and Copenhagen in December. As members might recall, the evening began with Aberdeen two points behind Copenhagen and needing to win if they were to qualify for the knock-out stages. The team's efforts and the fans' passion combined to create an amazingly stirring atmosphere and the remarkable&#8212;and, I have to say, very welcome&#8212;outcome was a thumping 4-0 victory for the Dons. That kind of night stays in the memory for a long time&#8212;and I hope that we get another memorable night later this week when Aberdeen play a second leg against Bayern Munich.</p><p>There are many examples of the good work that is being done by supporters' trusts throughout Scotland and I acknowledge the achievements of one such group: the Raith Trust in the Kirkcaldy <place-holder colnum=\"6151\"/> parliamentary constituency. In particular, I congratulate the trust on raising &#163;30,000 in its first two years and ensuring that much of that money has been invested in youth football to help find future star players.</p><p>I applaud the trust's involvement in the successful reclaim the Rovers campaign in 2005, which played a part in the deal to secure the future of Raith Rovers, and endorse the Raith Trust's stated view that football clubs and supporters must give something back to the communities from which they derive their support.</p><p>There are excellent examples of such activity at Raith Rovers, which now has a community group that promotes hospital visits and clean-up days at Starks Park and has started Raith TV on the club's website. I have not watched that programme, but I am sure that it is very interesting.</p><p>As other members have pointed out, Supporters Direct in Scotland has helped to turn round many failing clubs by, for example, working with the clubs, the community and the supporters and encouraging fans to get more involved. I applaud those achievements, and I encourage that approach as a way forward. After all, as fans make a lifetime commitment to a club, they should have a greater say in how their club is run, and I am certain that clubs, communities and fans working together is the way forward to create a sustainable future for Scottish football.</p><p>Over the past six years, Supporters Direct in Scotland has received a substantial amount of biannual funding&#8212;what I believe Willie Coffey called kick-start funding&#8212;which has been used to set up, establish and resource this valued organisation. As other members have said, Scottish Government officials have met Supporters Direct in Scotland twice in the past six months to discuss future funding arrangements. In the first of those meetings, which took place in August 2007, no firm commitments could be given beyond the expiry of the current funding arrangements due to the on-going spending review.</p><p>Officials also discussed the Scottish Government's belief that organisations should aim to be self-sustaining. It is clear that Supporters Direct in Scotland recognises that fact because, in 2006, it stated that one of its key objectives was to establish itself as a financially self-sustaining organisation. Supporters Direct in Scotland has indicated that it has had contact with a possible sponsor. That is a matter for the organisation to pursue. We await the outcome and hope that it will be positive.</p><p>In December 2007, Supporters Direct in Scotland submitted a request for renewed, and increased, Scottish Government funding for a <place-holder colnum=\"6152\"/> further three years from 1 April 2008. Officials met the organisation again in January of this year to discuss its application. In discussion, it emerged that the organisation has not held any formal conversations with the Scottish Football Association or sportscotland. Officials suggested that such a discussion could be useful and offered to arrange a joint meeting for Supporters Direct in Scotland with the Scottish Football Association and sportscotland to discuss future funding opportunities.</p><p>We have now spoken to Gordon Smith, who is the SFA chief executive, and to the partnership manager of sportscotland, both of whom will be happy to attend a joint meeting with Scottish Government officials and Supporters Direct in Scotland. That meeting will be an opportunity to explore future partnership arrangements that will ensure that the organisation can continue to deliver its aims and objectives.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13398510", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supporters Direct in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Marilyn Livingstone for securing the debate and echo Ted Brocklebank's thanks to James Kelly for coming off the bench as a late substitute.

As other members pointed out today and in committee, the pilot failed in the sense that he tries to interpret it. There were not thousands or even hundreds of users of the scheme. However, it succeeded in showing that we could not introduce a voluntary scheme for a home report and single survey. It also showed that we cannot have two separate schemes operating at the same time in the same marketplace. That is why it is necessary to introduce a mandatory scheme.</p><p>Mr McLetchie's comment on the cost was also incorrect. His intervention on Bob Doris was on that point. There will be a cost to the single survey, but he was comparing apples with pears. We will not be supplying a valuation for the cost of the single survey. Buyers will get something much better, with much more detail and information. Of course, the cost will be much less than the one that Mr McLetchie gave. He is taking the cost of the single survey and ignoring the fact that nine out of 10 sellers are also buyers, who will save money when they buy their next house. The cost will be the money that someone spends on their single survey, minus what they would have spent on surveys on the properties they try to buy.</p><p>Bob Doris mentioned artificially low upset prices. Removing that practice from the system is one of the main drivers behind the scheme. I agree with Johann Lamont on the issue of monitoring the policy.

In adding to what the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing said in her opening speech, I will say a few words about some crucial aspects of what we propose. Before I do that, I welcome the warm welcome that the Poverty Alliance, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and Save the Children gave to the proposals that we published today.</p><p>We have made it clear that we want to focus on three broad areas for action. First and foremost is tackling the root causes of poverty, by intervening early and preventing the problems that give rise to it. That means giving children the best start in the early years and at school, improving poor health, moving people who can work towards and into work, breaking patterns of reoffending, and addressing the discriminatory attitudes that underlie much poverty.</p><p>Secondly, we want to focus on lifting people who are in poverty out of poverty, through more and better employment that does not simply create a class of working poor, by making people more resilient, by improving the provision of advice and information, and by helping vulnerable people through key transitions in their lives.</p><p>Thirdly, we want to alleviate the impact of poverty on people's lives by maximising their income and reducing their costs. That is why we want to legislate to extend the entitlement to free school meals to all children of parents or carers in receipt of maximum child tax credit and maximum working tax credit. We have also pledged to abolish the unfair council tax and to introduce a fairer local income tax based on ability to pay.</p><p>In implementing our plans on poverty, we want to build connections with the whole of Scottish society. The fact that almost 900,000 Scots live in poverty is a shocking statistic that should be of concern to all Scots, not only those who are affected by poverty or those who work with people in poverty, but those in higher-income households, in the business sector and in public services.</p><p>A healthy society is one where the better off feel compassion for and solidarity with those who are disadvantaged. We want to build a commitment among Scotland's people that everybody has a role to play in enabling Scotland to overcome poverty and inequality. Our conviction is that Scotland can never fully succeed as long as so many of its people are unable to contribute to that success. During the forthcoming dialogue, we will be seeking views on how best to communicate on those issues with the whole of Scottish society.</p><p>I emphasise the crucial role of the third sector in helping us to deliver on our ambitions. The third sector can help us to reach individuals in poverty <place-holder colnum=\"5788\"/> because it enjoys a level of trust with vulnerable people that the state often struggles to achieve. We see great potential for social enterprises to deliver both services and employment for disadvantaged people, generating income and business success in some of our poorest areas. The third sector can help to design better public services that have a good feel for the needs of clients, while also acting as compelling advocates for the aspirations and concerns of our most vulnerable communities and individuals. It is important to work with the third sector as a full partner in a public discussion on poverty and in developing our framework for delivery and we are working with the Poverty Alliance on that. We have asked the alliance to oversee an exercise that will specifically engage with those in poverty as part of the forthcoming dialogue on poverty.</p><p>Members raised a number of important issues in the debate, and I wish to get through as many of them as I can in the time that I have available. Margaret Curran talked about ending child poverty by 2020. We share that ambition. We have said clearly that it is our aim to work with the UK Government to ensure that we end child poverty by 2020.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397569", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Poverty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank colleagues for taking part in what has been a stimulating and&#8212;often&#8212;  constructive debate on a subject of the utmost importance for the Scotland that we want to build for future generations.

It was important that we listened to our stakeholders and took account of the recent challenges and opportunities that winning the bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth games creates for Scottish sport. That offered a new dimension to the review. It is a fantastic opportunity and it provides even more reason to make the delivery of sport as efficient and effective as it can be, as quickly as possible.</p><p>The review examined whether sportscotland's current functions continue to be necessary and, if so, which organisational arrangements would be most effective at delivering them. As part of the review process, the Government agreed that it was crucial to engage with all our stakeholders and key players that represent the delivery of sport and to give them the opportunity to submit their views. That is why all the principal organisations that represent sports interests were consulted. Several Scottish governing bodies of sport were consulted directly and others were consulted as part of group workshops that were led by the Scottish Sports Association, which is the representative organisation for Scottish governing bodies. That enabled all bodies to have input into the review process. Other organisations, such as the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scottish Institute of Sport, the area institutes of sport and the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland, also contributed to the review.</p><p>Consultation was undertaken through a combination of written correspondence and discussions with key stakeholders. The feedback from stakeholders indicated that the majority wanted to retain a national agency for sport and that they valued its expertise. They identified the integrated one-stop approach to lottery and Government investment as paramount. However, they also felt that scope existed to simplify the complex sporting landscape. I have been impressed by the positive and practical responses from our stakeholders and I thank them for their input.<place-holder colnum=\"4780\"/></p><p>This country must ensure that the delivery of sport reaches the whole nation, and we are now presented with a unique opportunity to do that. Glasgow's tremendous success in winning the bid to host the Commonwealth games in 2014 for Scotland offers a great opportunity for Scottish sport and the people of Scotland. Not only is it an opportunity for those who take part as elite athletes, coaches or officials, it is an opportunity to inspire everyone in Scotland. Most of all, we want to inspire our young people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and to enjoy being active, with all the personal and social benefits that that brings.</p><p>This is truly an exciting time for sport. We therefore need to have an efficient, effective and co-ordinated approach to sports development. The delivery of sport depends heavily on having a robust developmental programme for sports professionals. We need people who can identify and disseminate good practice by working with national, regional and local sports development networks.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that the organisation that will deliver sport in Scotland is leaner and more efficient, by removing the layers of bureaucracy of the previous structure. It will be fit for purpose and will ensure that the interests of sport remain paramount. It will provide strong support throughout the country by nurturing talent, supporting grass roots and boosting participation in sport.</p><p>Having listened to and considered stakeholders' views and opinions, the Government has decided that sportscotland should merge with the Scottish Institute of Sport into a single body under a single board. The Government wants to declutter the sporting landscape and to ensure that the new organisation delivers sport in a more effective and efficient manner that will benefit Scotland. I emphasise that we are not just merging two bodies but carrying out a radical overhaul. We will create a flatter structure and bring delivery much closer to the user.</p><p>We have decided that the newly merged organisation will retain the name sportscotland, because we do not want to waste time or money on an unnecessary rebranding exercise when sportscotland is a strong and recognised brand in the marketplace.

That decision will come as a huge <place-holder colnum=\"4781\"/> disappointment to Labour members, who desperately hoped to attack the Government. Their attacks have again proved to be nothing more than the usual ridiculous scaremongering. We intend to initiate the relocation as soon as possible. The organisation will ultimately be located at the new indoor arena in Glasgow.</p><p>Basing sportscotland in Glasgow will emphasise the opportunities that the 2014 games will bring and the important role that sportscotland will need to play in ensuring that there is a legacy from those games for the people of Scotland. Sportscotland will also have a crucial role in supporting our aspiration to have the most successful Scottish games team ever.</p><p>The Scottish Institute of Sport will be sportscotland's performance delivery arm. It will report directly to sportscotland's chief executive officer and board and will be tasked with primary responsibility for delivering on the elite athlete programme. The high-performance hub will remain in Stirling and will be encouraged and supported to continue to operate in an innovative and unique way that is appropriate to the performance sport environment.</p><p>Links across the six area institutes of sport will be strengthened and the potential will exist to simplify funding arrangements. Following discussion on simplifying the structure further, it is intended to reduce the number of area boards from 12 to six.</p><p>We aim to create a clearer and better supported performance pathway for our aspiring athletes and governing bodies, and we acknowledge the important role that performance experts can play with the Scottish Institute of Sport, not only in the area of high performance but in taking a technical lead role in performance development. Sportscotland will be charged with ensuring that there is a seamless pathway from grass-roots level to elite-performance level. It will also continue to provide Government and lottery funding by taking an integrated strategic approach, fulfil statutory functions, and provide expert advice and support services to sport throughout Scotland.</p><p>We will create a number of decentralised delivery hubs, which will provide expertise and advice to local authorities and Scottish governing bodies of sport. The decentralised delivery approach will build on sportscotland's experience of remote working practices, which its staff already use, and enable there to be a reduced central headquarters office base. We believe that that approach will achieve greater efficiency and promote smarter and greener working practices for a national delivery organisation. However, I make clear to staff that there will be no compulsory redundancies because of the changes.<place-holder colnum=\"4782\"/></p><p>The proposal is to create four hubs&#8212;one alongside the new headquarters in Glasgow, and ones in Edinburgh, Stirling and Aberdeen. The decentralised hubs will ensure that staff will be able to work more closely with the area institutes, local authorities and governing bodies. There will be less travelling time for staff, which will enable them to concentrate on building strong partnerships with their stakeholders.</p><p>The new sportscotland will encourage wider participation through more initiatives like the active schools initiative and will support talented sportspeople who have the potential to reach world-class standards.</p><p>The three national centres&#8212;at Inverclyde, Cumbrae and Glenmore Lodge&#8212;will continue to operate as trusts under their current arrangements. They will be linked more closely and will play a role in the new decentralised delivery structure.</p><p>A new single board will be established to replace the existing boards of sportscotland and the SIS. That board will retain a number of its current members, but it will be encouraged to recruit the additional expertise that is required to support its new structure. An implementation team, which will include sportscotland and SIS staff and Government officials, will be created to oversee the setting up of the new organisation.</p><p>The decisions that have been taken meet all the objectives that we set for the review of sportscotland. They meet the needs of sport, take account of the views of stakeholders and reduce the number of public bodies.</p><p>We must now look to the future of sport in Scotland and build on the success of the 2006 Commonwealth games in Melbourne, in which Scottish athletes made outstanding achievements. It is important that we now set in place an infrastructure that will deliver an even greater medal tally in Glasgow. We also want to ensure that our athletes receive the best possible support to enable them to excel in the Olympics and Paralympics in Beijing later this year. Scotland will also have a team of young athletes competing in the Commonwealth youth games in Pune in India in October. I hope that some of those athletes will go on to success in Glasgow in 2014.</p><p>In addition, we must work towards the winter Olympics and Paralympics in Vancouver and the Commonwealth games in New Delhi in 2010. However, this is not just about Commonwealth and Olympic sport. In Scotland, we can look forward to Ryder cup golf in 2014. Recently, Scotland has seen a resurgence in its success in football internationally, not just with the national team but with our club teams, and Andy Murray <place-holder colnum=\"4783\"/> got Scotland off to a great sporting start to the new year with his win in Qatar. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p>We are committed to sport in Scotland and to securing a firm and lasting legacy for the future. That was part of our successful bid for the 2014 Commonwealth games, through which we will have an opportunity to showcase Scotland on the international stage, to increase Scotland's sporting prowess and, most important, to demonstrate a long-lasting benefit to sport.</p><p>Scotland as a nation is passionate about sport. We want our young people to be inspired by Scottish athletes performing on the international stage and in a major showcase event on home soil in 2014. We will improve facilities and sports venues, we will focus on increasing participation in sport and physical activity, and we will create an army of volunteers for future sporting events. There will also be many non-sporting benefits for Scotland, probably the most important being the potential improvements to our nation's health.</p><p>The Government is committed to implementing \"Reaching Higher: Building on the Success of Sport 21\", the national sport strategy, which was launched early last year. The strategy defines what needs to be done to improve sport in Scotland and lays out clear and specific roles and responsibilities for all the major partners in Scottish sport&#8212;the Scottish Government, sportscotland, local authorities and sports governing bodies. It is crucial that we provide strong leadership to achieve that, and we look to our partners to do likewise.</p><p>We are all alive to how sport can make a significant contribution across society and to the fact that, without doubt, sport contributes to our objective of making Scotland a nation that is wealthier and fairer, healthier, smarter, safer and stronger, and greener. We are emerging from a period of change both nationally and locally, and we have a unique opportunity to ensure that the value of sport is high on a range of new and emerging policy agendas, such as in education, health and transport. For example, we must continue to encourage physical activity for everyone and continue to promote walking and cycling to benefit the health of the people of Scotland.</p><p>All members are aware of the concerns&#8212;which we share&#8212;about reduced lottery funding for grass-roots sport. We continue to pursue the matter with the UK Government. Since the lottery began, about &#163;275 million has been invested in sports projects in Scotland alone. That is a significant investment that we cannot allow to be hijacked. Specifically, Scotland will lose more than &#163;13 million from Scottish sport. Why should Scottish sport suffer to deliver a London 2012 Olympic games? Why is it that winning a major <place-holder colnum=\"4784\"/> sporting event for London means more lottery money being invested there, but Scotland winning a major sporting event for Glasgow results in lottery funding being taken away from Scottish sport? That is unacceptable, and it is an issue on which the Government will continue to press.</p><p>The priorities for the new organisation will be to work with partners to continue to deliver the \"Reaching Higher\" strategy, increase participation and improve performance. It is also important that the new organisation continues to strengthen the development of improved partnerships with the governing bodies and local authorities. By getting rid of duplication, simplifying structures and stopping activities that do not contribute to the Government's objectives, we will free up Scotland's public servants to provide the services that people need.</p><p>The new organisation will also continue to support our athletes, work towards increasing the number and quality of Scots competing on the international stage, and improve the performance landscape in Scotland. That will be achieved by ensuring that the key role and functions of the Scottish Institute of Sport are maintained and by strengthening links with the area institute network.</p><p>This is a new year and a new beginning for sportscotland as a new organisation. It will give its entire staff more opportunity to work in partnership with their stakeholders. It will ensure the best delivery of sport to all the people of Scotland, who will be given the opportunity to participate and enjoy sport at every level. The new structure will ensure not only that our aspiring athletes can achieve their full potential but that the wider benefits of sport reach out to the whole nation.</p><p>I am confident that the decision is the right one for sport, for all sportsmen and sportswomen, and for the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395063", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sportscotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The changes in how sportscotland is structured and operates to support sport better are the key, and we will initiate changes as quickly as possible with that in mind.

Things are not perfect, despite what the Lib Dems and Labour Party try to say. The motion states that sportscotland must remain, but it makes no mention of room for improvement. There are issues that need to be reviewed. In fact, a review of sportscotland was due a number of years ago, but the previous Administration utterly failed to carry that out. It is quite correct that we are carrying out a review.</p><p>In the debate, members have deliberately mixed up two different things. It is important that the delivery of sport by staff and experts is retained, but some members have mixed that up with the administrative structures that provide that necessary expertise and delivery. We absolutely support the experts and the staff in the delivery of sport, but we feel that the current structures are wrong.

I thank all members who have taken part in it.</p><p>Like other members, I congratulate Christine Grahame on securing the debate and on raising awareness in the chamber and throughout Scotland of the tragic loss of HMT Lancastria at Saint-Nazaire on 17 June 1940, during the withdrawal of the British expeditionary force from France. As other members have stated, congratulations are also due to the Lancastria Association of Scotland for its work and excellent campaigning on the issue. Christine Grahame asked whether I was willing to meet her and representatives of the association to discuss the matter; I am more than happy to offer to do so.</p><p>To this day, the terrible event that we are debating represents the greatest loss of life in British maritime history. As Murdo Fraser pointed out, it was also the greatest single loss of British forces in the second world war. The loss of 4,000 lives, of which around 400 were Scots&#8212;even those are merely estimates&#8212;is horrific enough, but for the loss of the Lancastria to be officially denied for so long is not only insulting to the memory of those who perished but offensive to those who survived the tragedy of that day 67 years ago.</p><p>The Scottish Government firmly believes that every Scot who has made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of their nation, and the courage and valour of Scots who have fought&#8212;and who still fight today&#8212;to defend our values and our <place-holder colnum=\"4131\"/> democracy should be appropriately recognised and commemorated. They deserve nothing less than our overwhelming gratitude and support. It is particularly important that we do not allow our young people, for whom there may not be any direct family link to the military, to forget.</p><p>As we have already heard, the survivors of the Lancastria believe that they have been denied that recognition. This Government applauds the efforts of the Lancastria Association of Scotland in campaigning on behalf of those who were killed and those who survived.</p><p>On Monday this week, I met Derek Twigg MP, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence and Minister for Veterans at the Ministry of Defence. I raised the issue of the Lancastria and the association's campaign. It is clearly preferable that the loss of all 4,000 lives&#8212;not just the 400-plus Scots involved&#8212;should be commemorated, and in that regard there is an important role for the United Kingdom Government to play. Mr Twigg has promised to come back to me in due course with the MOD's position. If appropriate, I will be happy to share those views with Christine Grahame and other members.</p><p>This Government supports efforts to raise a permanent memorial to the incident in the grounds of the Golden Jubilee national hospital in Clydebank, which Des McNulty spoke about. The ship was built on that site, and we fully endorse a previous minister's approval of the scheme, subject to statutory planning permissions.</p><p>I should perhaps reiterate that the long-standing policy of successive Governments has been that the cost of erecting memorials and associated projects is not usually met from public funds but from private donations and/or public subscription. Neither the Scottish Government nor the Ministry of Defence has responsibility for the funding or maintenance of memorials.</p><p>I am aware of the petition presented to the Public Petitions Committee by the association, which calls on the Parliament to commission a commemorative medal for the Scots who were caught up in the terrible actions of that day in 1940. I will come to that in a moment. Colleagues will, however, appreciate that calls for a more formal, official recognition of the tragedy and the designation of the Lancastria's final resting place as an official war grave are outside the competence of the Parliament and fall to the UK Government to resolve, although I am more than happy to support them.</p><p>Each year on remembrance Sunday, Scots the length and breadth of our nation gather to commemorate those who, in the words of the Kohima epitaph, gave their tomorrow so that we can have our today. Each of us finds our own way <place-holder colnum=\"4132\"/> to remember those who fell, but I wonder how many of us are aware of the tragic events of 17 June 1940.</p><p>Being aware is not always the same as recognising the sacrifice. Indeed, a recurring theme in discussions with veteran's organisations is not a desire for grand gestures or even memorials but for simple recognition of the endeavour, courage, valour and sacrifice of the Scots men and women in our armed forces. The Scottish Government and the Parliament can be proud of the support that both have shown since devolution for Scotland's veteran's community. We have an opportunity today to continue that tradition of recognition of and support for those who have given the utmost sacrifice in our name and in defence of our nation.</p><p>The Government is therefore happy to support the call in the motion for official recognition from the UK Government of the tragic event, and it awaits a response to the representations made to the Minister for Veterans. I hope that we get a positive response from Mr Twigg that gives due recognition to all the fallen from this terrible event. If we do not, I can confirm today that, in light of the unique scale and enormity of the disaster, this Government will act to put right years of neglect and lack of recognition by providing a commemorative medal for each Scot who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the tragedy. I believe that that is the appropriate and right action for the Scottish Government to take on behalf of the survivors and those who fell in the Lancastria disaster.<place-holder time=\"17:49:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:49.</em></p>", "hdate": "2007-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393699", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lancastria"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is an honour for me to respond on behalf of the Scottish Government to this important debate.

I want the progress that has already made to be built on in the most disadvantaged areas.</p><p>I expect CPPs to use the resources that they are allocated from the new unified fund, along with mainstream resources, to tackle concentrated poverty and disadvantage. Part of that should be working with people living in former coalfield areas to identify lasting and sustainable solutions.</p><p>I have said that this Government is committed to targeting resources towards those communities most in need, but we cannot view the needs of our most deprived communities as something that the public sector alone must address. That is why creating positive and lasting relationships with CPPs, the private, voluntary and community sectors, is vital to the sustainable regeneration of coalfield communities. Communities themselves need to be at the heart of that partnership, shaping the activities that best meet their needs.</p><p>That grass-roots approach is a strength of the CRT. The approach has been instrumental in establishing the trust as a respected player in the regeneration field and among communities in particular. A crucial link has been made with local businesses that provide investment and employment, which will help sustain the economic base of former coalfield areas.</p><p>The CRT has an impressive record of delivery and working in partnership. Between 2005 and 2007 it has supported 126 different projects, drawing in more than &#163;5.5 million in partnership funding for projects. A joint venture with the Bank of Scotland and the Scottish Football Association involving a midnight leagues programme is an excellent example of partnership working as it engages young people between the ages of 12 and 16 in evening football events and promotes healthy lifestyles, builds confidence and produces positive outcomes.</p><p>I also note the successes in key areas such as supporting people into work, training, social enterprise development and health-related projects.</p><p>I turn to the issue of funding for the CRT, which so many members have raised. I am confident that as a respected player in the regeneration field and among communities, the CRT will continue to play a valuable role in helping to regenerate some of Scotland's most deprived communities.

I begin by making a clear and unambiguous statement about the Government's position. We are committed to an equal and fair Scotland in which we value the diversity of our people and recognise their different needs and aspirations; foster respect for others and challenge prejudice and discriminatory attitudes; and ensure that people's experiences and life chances are not impeded by unjust discrimination and systemic bias on account of their race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, belief or age.</p><p>We want a Scotland in which every individual has the freedom and opportunity to be all that they can be. Over the years, there has been significant progress to that end in legislation and policy and there have been real shifts in attitudes. For example, men were executed for homosexuality in Britain 200 years ago, and male homosexual relationships were unlawful in Scotland 30 years ago. However, in 2005, civil partnerships were introduced, and I think that we can all agree that that was a serious and welcome step forward.</p><p>However, too many people do not yet experience equality or opportunity. One woman in five will experience abuse by a male partner in her lifetime. Women still do not have equal pay with men. People from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are less likely to occupy representative positions or to be visible in the leadership roles of civic society. Bigotry and sectarianism unfortunately still pervade parts of our communities. Many disabled people have no qualifications and are too often judged by what they cannot do rather than by what they can do. Older people are not always valued for the contribution that they can make. People are bullied and discriminated against because they are gay or lesbian.</p><p>Securing a fairer and more equal Scotland sits squarely with our strategic objectives and is reflected in our national outcomes and our budget. We have allocated &#163;61 million in the budget over three years specifically for equality. That represents an &#163;11 million increase over three years from the 2007-08 actual allocation.<place-holder colnum=\"3807\"/></p><p>The funding that has been identified for work on equality is for the Scottish Government to allocate. I emphasise that it is not being rolled up into the local government settlement. Hugh O'Donnell's amendment is factually incorrect on that point. It is also not correct to say that the violence against women fund and the children's services-women's aid fund are being rolled into the local government settlement. As I explained in the domestic abuse debate last week, allocation of those funds remains the responsibility of the Scottish Government. Only a small element of the funds, which corresponds to moneys that are currently given to local authorities for the projects that they run, will be passed over in the settlement. The significant increase in the equality budget will be directed primarily at tackling violence against women, including work on women and children who are affected by domestic abuse. We therefore reject the amendment lodged by Hugh O'Donnell.</p><p>We will, however, accept the amendment lodged by Johann Lamont. In so doing, we acknowledge the importance of equality impact assessment. We view it as a key driver in delivering on our commitment to ensure that our investment and policies promote equality and do not discriminate or perpetuate inequality.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392994", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Equality and Diversity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak to and move the motion during the Parliament's equality and diversity week.

I am sure that, at the end of the debate, he will give the member a clear and unequivocal answer.<place-holder colnum=\"3808\"/></p><p>I will move on. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth outlined our approach to mainstreaming equality and the Scottish budget in his letter to the convener of the Equal Opportunities Committee of 21 November. The equality impact assessment tool that we have developed is available for use across the Government. We will keep it under review to ensure that it is fit for purpose, and in so doing we will value the input of the equality proofing the budget and policy advisory group. We view equality impact assessment as a key mechanism for ensuring both that our policies respond to the different needs of people in Scotland and that those needs are reflected in the resources that are allocated to delivery.</p><p>Public bodies, including local authorities, are key to delivering change. They, too, are subject to the public sector equality duties, and they have responsibilities to ensure that the impact of their policies on equality is assessed. We very much value our partnership with local government on this agenda, and we are pleased to be working on a joint equality statement with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which we hope to finalise shortly.</p><p>Disabled people should be valued and respected and able to participate fully in our society. We will continue to listen to the views of disabled people about what needs to be done. The report of the disability inquiry undertaken by the Parliament's Equal Opportunities Committee will help to inform our approach in the period ahead. I am specifically considering how best to advance work on independent living. That is an important issue on which I know Parliament is keen to see progress. I intend to say something further on the matter in the new year.</p><p>The number of British Sign Language/English interpreters on the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters register has increased from 39, in March 2003, to 52, with 13 trainee associate members. We will continue that work, as well as developing a detailed plan for improving linguistic access for deaf, deafblind and hard of hearing people. The Scottish Government has recently produced new guidance on self-directed support and will be undertaking a review of the disabled student allowance. All of those, I believe, are welcome developments for disabled people.</p><p>Our demographic is changing. We are an ageing population&#8212;I certainly feel that I am ageing today. Age should not be a barrier to the opportunities that are available to people to participate in Scottish society. The spending review contains commitments of particular import to older people, such as the freeze on council tax, the uprating of free personal and nursing care and a commitment <place-holder colnum=\"3809\"/> to improve support for people who are affected by dementia.</p><p>A traditional African saying is that there is no music in a single sound; different sounds are needed to give music harmony. Scotland is an increasingly diverse nation with a growing minority ethnic population. That diversity enriches us, but racism, sectarianism and Islamophobia undermine Scotland's image and reputation as a nation of tolerance and acceptance.</p><p>Recent acts of terror have tested attitudes, and it is to Scotland's credit that there has been little scapegoating of communities. We recognise that there has been a heightening of tension and that some fear a shift in attitudes. We are absolutely clear: those acts of terror were criminal acts by individuals, not communities. We value the positive relationship with our communities and are looking to develop further our community engagement work.</p><p>Racism is a blight on any nation. We are proud that Scotland has taken a public stand against it through its one Scotland campaign. I acknowledge the work undertaken by previous ministers to build that campaign and I put it on record that we will continue to move the campaign forward.</p><p>We will also need to consider how new migration and the linkages between race and faith work should be addressed. We will do that as part of the redrafting of the statement and action plan on race equality on which we will engage with stakeholders early next year.</p><p>This Parliament and its committees have rightly taken a keen interest in Gypsy Travellers. The Gypsy Traveller community has been marginalised and excluded for far too long. It is a community that is not understood and about which myths and incorrect assumptions abound. I know that the Parliament is concerned to see progress on that issue and that members want to know how the recommendations of the Equal Opportunities Committee's report on Gypsy Travellers will be advanced. We will consider that as part of the race equality statement and action plan and will report back to Parliament in due course.</p><p>On asylum seekers and refugees, we have made clear our principled position on a number of issues, such as our opposition to dawn raids and the detention of families in Dungavel. We believe that those with legacy cases should be given leave to remain if there has been no involvement in criminality or fraud, and that the right to work should be restored. This Government has acted swiftly in an area in which we have jurisdiction: asylum-seeking young people who have been studying in Scottish schools for at least three years will be able to apply for full-time courses at <place-holder colnum=\"3810\"/> universities and colleges&#8212;a move that has been widely welcomed.</p><p>This Government welcomes the gender duty and the opportunities that it presents to progress gender equality in Scotland. We will continue to work with others to address violence against women, the pay gap and occupational segregation; challenge stereotypical attitudes about men and women's roles; and support the engagement of women and women's organisations.</p><p>Scotland has made great strides in improving legislative rights and policy recognition for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, but, unfortunately, homophobic attitudes remain an underlying barrier to equality. The LGBT hearts and minds group is exploring the prejudice and discrimination experienced by communities in Scotland and I look forward to receiving its report in early 2008.</p><p>We welcome the legislative changes and the discrimination law review, with the prospect of a single equality act and a single equality duty. However, we share some of the concerns that have been expressed by equality stakeholders about some of the proposals. We conveyed those concerns to the United Kingdom Government in September 2007.</p><p>We look forward to working closely with the new Equality and Human Rights Commission, with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, with the Parliament and with the range of equality interests whose activities have been crucial in the advancement of equality in Scotland to date.</p><p>I believe that there is much to do to achieve a fair and equal society, and I hope that members will support us in meeting the challenge.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament is committed to securing equality of opportunity and a fairer Scotland in which diversity of need is recognised, respect for others is fostered, stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes and behaviours are challenged and people have more control over their lives and welcomes Equality and Diversity Week, the creation of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the commitment of the Scottish Government to promoting and mainstreaming equality and to working in partnership with public bodies, the voluntary sector, business interests and communities to tackle disadvantage and the barriers to equality.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392994", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Equality and Diversity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps I should leave that to Mr Ewing.

I look forward to finding out more about the issues that have been raised.</p><p>We have had a good debate this afternoon. As other members have said, we all share the belief that deafness should not be a barrier to children achieving their full potential. As other members have done, I welcome the campaign's principles and its emphasis on encouraging deaf young people to get involved and to ensure that their voices are heard. The Government is committed to working closely with people and communities throughout Scotland to achieve change and to make improvements to their lives.</p><p>We recognise that it is particularly important to engage with people who may be marginalised&#8212;in this case by youth and deafness&#8212;which is why we are funding a policy and engagement post in the Scottish Council on Deafness to help improve the dialogue between deaf people and the Government. We are already seeing the impact of that work.</p><p>I also commend the National Deaf Children's Society for the support that it provides to families with deaf children throughout Scotland. I will <place-holder colnum=\"2397\"/> highlight some of the ways in which the NDCS is making a particular contribution to our work. I am pleased that the NDCS is one of the 14 organisations that participate in the multiple and complex needs initiative, through which the NDCS has received funding to develop a project that involves working with Scottish Asian families who have deaf children. The project is designed to help to counter the multiple disadvantages that we know black and minority-ethnic disabled people and their families often face.</p><p>The NDCS is a valued member of the Government's British Sign Language and linguistic access working group, which is working with us to improve linguistic access for people who are born deaf or who acquire hearing loss. The group is developing a long-term strategy and access to education for deaf children is a key area of its work. As part of that work, we have recently commissioned a scoping study of access for deaf children and young people and their pathway through school and further and higher education. The Scottish sensory centre and the NDCS are jointly undertaking the study on our behalf and the results will help to inform the work of the BSL and linguistic access working group. Those results will, I am sure, be reflected in the group's strategy document, which I look forward to having early next year.</p><p>As members will be aware, this week is learn to sign week. I commend the work that the Scottish Deaf Association is undertaking to raise awareness of the barriers and discrimination that deaf people face and to improve linguistic access for deaf people through the \"no need to shout ... just learn to sign!\" campaign. As an employer, the Scottish Government is delighted to support the initiative and is offering BSL taster sessions for staff, which are provided by the Scottish Deaf Association. We will also encourage staff to look beyond the taster sessions and to undertake longer courses. I hope that the initiative will make a lasting contribution to the Government and its staff. I thank Donaldson's College and the NDCS for coming to Parliament today to offer BSL taster sessions to members. I am sure that members will join me in wishing Donaldson's College well as it prepares to move to its new premises in Linlithgow in January, as Mary Scanlon mentioned.</p><p>In opening the debate, Cathie Craigie asked about the statistics and data on achievement&#8212;or the lack of data, which might be a better way of putting it.

Unfortunately, I missed it, too&#8212;I knew it was on, but my diary did not allow me to attend. Nigel Don made a thoughtful speech that covered a lot of ground. He mentioned a UK Government report on disability, but that particular report contains no recommendations for the Scottish Government, as it dealt only with reserved matters. I say that in case members thought that it had direct implications for the Government in Scotland.</p><p>It is unfortunate that Robin Harper has had to leave because he made a crucial point when he mentioned the importance of BSL in daily life. We often forget that BSL can make a huge difference not only in offering access to the particularly difficult parts of life, but in offering access to the normal day-to-day parts of life. That goes not only for young people but for all people who are deaf or hearing impaired.</p><p>Mary Scanlon asked a very direct question on what the Government will do for deaf people. The Government is committed to improving linguistic access for deaf and hard-of-hearing people&#8212;I am sure that we would all agree that we should do that. As we consider our priorities over the coming period, we will continue to work closely with the key organisations that are active in deafness. We will do that through our BSL and linguistic access working group. Although the group covers all forms of deafness and hearing loss, an important part of our work will be in ensuring that deaf sign language users are able to access services and to participate in daily and public life as active citizens. I hope that we would all agree on the importance of that, too.</p><p>We will continue to work to reduce the exclusion that deaf people face. For example, we will raise awareness of BSL and encourage its uptake. We are considering ways of increasing the number of registered interpreters in Scotland. Our commitment to working in partnership will help to ensure that we take the right approach and that <place-holder colnum=\"2399\"/> our work continues to be shaped directly by the views of deaf people and their organisations.

It has been an excellent debate, with a lot of good contributions from all parties.</p><p>I am interested in the Warm Zones approach, but it is just one approach; it is not an end in itself. I ask members to turn their thoughts to what the end is&#8212;many have done so. The goal is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"To ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that people are not living in fuel poverty in Scotland by November 2016.\"</p><p>I reaffirm my commitment to that goal.</p><p>The number of households in fuel poverty has been rising every year since 2002, which is a cause for concern to us all. We need serious debate about what is effective and what is not&#8212;about what can be done differently and what new avenues are open to us. I am grateful to Mr Gibson for moving the debate on with a discussion about the Warm Zones approach.</p><p>The Warm Zones approach has met with various levels of success. Although I am interested in it, we must study both what has worked and what has not worked before we come to any conclusions about its effectiveness. Taking forward the fuel poverty agenda, I am keen to encourage ideas that can lever in additional funding to support our own. In that regard, I am particularly determined that Scotland should get its fair share of resource from phase 3 of the energy efficiency commitment funding. I am also keen to encourage the development of robust partnerships to achieve our common goals. Tackling fuel poverty requires the combined action of public bodies, voluntary organisations and the energy companies. I agree with the many members who raised that point.</p><p>I also want to see a sharper focus on hard-to-reach households&#8212;vulnerable households that might not apply to Government programmes without encouragement&#8212;and I aim to ensure that people are not disadvantaged because of where they live. There must be fair treatment of people in both urban and rural areas and a logical response to local circumstances.</p><p>It is clear from the concerns that have been expressed to me by members from all parties that people are worried by the fact that many of our <place-holder colnum=\"2324\"/> rural island communities are suffering from the worst rates of fuel poverty in Scotland. It would be a dereliction of duty on my part if I did not examine the programmes that are in place and ensure that they are enhanced so that they help those communities that are suffering most from fuel poverty.</p><p>Some of the features in a well-thought-out Warm Zone make the idea worth exploring, but not all Warm Zones have been equally well thought out. Indeed, some have struggled to deliver real achievements. For example, the target for Warm Zones in England was a 50 per cent reduction in fuel poverty over three years. As many members will know, the best performer was Stockton, with a reduction in fuel poverty of 23 per cent over three years. That was an excellent return, but the worst performer, Hull, managed a reduction in fuel poverty of just 2 per cent. Clearly, there are lessons to learn both from areas that have done well and from areas that have, unfortunately, not done so well.</p><p>Similarly, there may be other approaches to fuel poverty work that demonstrate the same and other attractive principles and may be worth considering. I am willing to listen to constructive ideas about various approaches. We have heard about many such approaches tonight. We need to seek opportunities to engage with those who deliver policy and those who influence delivery. One such opportunity will present itself shortly, when I meet the chief executive of Energy Action Scotland. As I have said to many members, especially the members of the Local Government and Communities Committee, I will also soon meet representatives of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets.</p><p>We must be clear. Warm Zones are not a panacea&#8212;I do not think that anybody is suggesting that they are. However, they suggest an approach to fuel poverty work that deserves further investigation. In fact, that investigation is already under way. My officials recently visited the Warm Zone in Gateshead, which seems to be working well and is based on the successful Stockton model.</p><p>Mary Scanlon mentioned that she is an energy-efficient MSP. I think that the idea behind that programme&#8212;which I know Robin Harper is also involved in&#8212;is interesting. It is unfortunate that Mary Scanlon had to leave the chamber for an appointment at 5.30, as she made some excellent points. She laid out clearly the extent of the challenge that we face in tackling fuel poverty, especially in the Highlands and Islands. Both she and Alasdair Allan mentioned the use of smart meters, which I have seen in some houses. As Mary Scanlon pointed out, it is important that we <place-holder colnum=\"2325\"/> all take personal responsibility for our energy efficiency.</p><p>Like Johann Lamont, I look forward to the Local Government and Communities Committee's short inquiry into fuel poverty. I absolutely agree with her that every layer of Government needs to be involved in the process. As I have said before and repeat now, I am keen to have a dialogue with fuel companies in the not-too-distant future to ensure that they are aware of our determination to ensure that they play their part in tackling fuel poverty.</p><p>Johann Lamont also raised the issue of the pilot in Dundee. It is fair to say that the Dundee pilot had very mixed results but, although it was not quite as successful as it could have been, I think that many lessons can be learned from it.</p><p>Johann Lamont also asked about marketing. The warm deal programme is currently being promoted through the managing agent and the installer network as well as, of course, through organisations that have an interest in fuel poverty or energy efficiency.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389139", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Warm Zones"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I congratulate Kenneth Gibson on securing the debate, which has raised interesting issues that I am keen to explore further.

He made good points about decentralised energy generation and local micro-energy production, as did Sarah Boyack. I certainly welcome those contributions on what is an interesting area for exploration, especially as we move forward with renewable energy. The example from the Netherlands that Robin Harper cited was extremely interesting. It seems a perfectly logical idea that small energy generation schemes will not suffer the massive outage that can occur when a big scheme goes down. I understand the point that he made.</p><p>The statistics that Alasdair Allan cited about 42 per cent of his Western Isles constituents living in fuel poverty are, frankly, shocking. That is one <place-holder colnum=\"2326\"/> reason why we as a Parliament must seriously tackle fuel poverty.</p><p>Sarah Boyack gave a very thoughtful and detailed speech&#8212;that did not surprise me given her background and her interest in the subject. On the issue of energy advice centres, I think that the best thing is for me to take that away tonight and write to her about it in due course. She also mentioned that Mr Swinney had rejected the idea of the council tax rebates that have been provided by local authorities in England. Frankly, I think that we want to consider all options and get the best way forward for tackling fuel poverty. As I have made it clear before, the central heating programme and the warm deal have done a lot of excellent work in helping people over the past few years, but we need to move forward. We need to ensure that fuel poverty is at the centre of our attention. Fuel poverty has been on the rise since 2002. We must do all that we can within our powers to try to tackle that difficult problem.</p><p>Warm Zones are a concept that provides many models of implementation. Like any concept, it stands or falls according to how well it is interpreted in practice. Our consideration of Warm Zones and any other new ideas for tackling fuel poverty must be extensive and thorough to ensure that we provide the best possible deal for those who live with the unacceptable burden of fuel poverty.

As the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing said, reviewing the grant agreements will allow us to secure the levers that will enable us to hold the GHA to account. I thought that that was what we all wanted to do. The original set-up of the organisation did not allow us to hold GHA to account, but that is what we intend to do.</p><p>I offer a further commitment on the negotiations. We will report to Parliament on progress on the renegotiation of contracts as soon as possible. That commitment represents progress in ensuring that the Parliament is up to date and up to speed with what is happening between the Government and the GHA.</p><p>At the beginning of her speech, Johann Lamont said that the GHA is failing to deliver and that it has an overly centralised decision-making process. I have to say that the previous Labour Administration set up the GHA. That Administration set up an organisation that is overly centralised and which failed to deliver, so it is a bit rich for Johann Lamont to come here and criticise us. It is also a bit rich for her to quote the report selectively and refuse to accept some parts while praising other parts to high heaven.

It is right that those investments have been made and we support the work that has been done thus far.</p><p>As usual, Ross Finnie made an interesting and amusing speech.

I also welcome the thoughtful and thought-provoking comments that she made in opening the debate and&#8212;of course&#8212;the others contributions by members from throughout the chamber. They confirm once again that Parliament is concerned about the current United Kingdom asylum policy and that we have a shared desire to improve things.</p><p>The Scottish Government supports the motion. We are committed to improving the situation of asylum seekers in Scotland, particularly the many children and families who have made Scotland their home. We support the right for asylum seekers to work and we believe that all families that have been here for some time, other than those that are involved in criminal or fraudulent activity, should be granted leave to remain.</p><p>By way of background, it is important to acknowledge that Scotland has a different cohort of refugees and asylum seekers to other parts of the United Kingdom: they are mainly families, <place-holder colnum=\"1427\"/> rather than single people. Some have children who were born in Scotland or who have spent many years in Scottish schools. That has led inevitably to greater integration for the young people and their parents. We in Scotland can be justly proud of our record on integrating asylum seekers and refugees, and of the excellent services that they receive in education, health, social work and the assistance of the police. However, there is always room for improvement, as everyone who has spoken recognises.</p><p>We must continue to ensure that people who come to our country feel welcomed into our communities, that they see the best that Scotland has to offer and that they are willing to share their culture, their lives and their futures with us. We want Scotland to be at ease with its diversity and to be a place where people want to live and work and feel welcome.</p><p>Many of our asylum-seeking young people are high achievers academically as well as in sports and the arts, and have helped to drive up results in our schools by displaying a positive work ethic and a strong desire to learn. They are exactly the kind of young people we need in Scotland. Many of the adults are also highly motivated and skilled, and are keen to contribute to their new country and communities. At present, however, they do not have the opportunity to achieve their full potential, economic or otherwise, while they are waiting for decisions on their claims.</p><p>Scotland needs bright, talented and hard-working individuals to live, work and study in Scotland to help to ensure the long-term economic and cultural growth of our Scotland so that we can achieve our goal of a wealthier and fairer Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Government agrees whole-heartedly with the statement from the Scottish Refugee Council in the motion that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It just makes absolutely no sense to have people sitting at home in enforced idleness when they could be contributing to the economy\".</p><p>I also want to reaffirm the Government's commitment to ensuring that, regardless of where they come from and why they have come to this country, any child living in Scotland receives the care, protection and education that they need. We recognise our responsibility for all children in Scotland and our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and we are clear that the welfare and rights of all children are paramount.</p><p>The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has already announced plans to deliver fairer access to education for asylum-seeking children. Those children currently go to school and, by giving them the same access to <place-holder colnum=\"1428\"/> higher and further education and to nursery education as have Scottish children, we will ensure equity of opportunity.</p><p>At the same time as we make those changes, we will continue our discussions with the United Kingdom Government on issues that are outwith our direct control. We have already made it clear to the UK Government that we are fundamentally opposed to dawn raids and to the detention of children in Dungavel and elsewhere.</p><p>As many members have pointed out, the story in today's <em>Herald</em> highlights yet again why the detention of children is wrong. I share many of the concerns that were raised by colleagues during the debate. As things stand, I am not in a position to say how much of that story reflects the reality of the situation in Dungavel, but the Border and Immigration Agency claims that most of the story is inaccurate. However, it is clear that we need to find out the truth of what is happening at Dungavel. I can tell Parliament that, in the light of that story, we will write to the Border and Immigration Agency in the next few days to seek reassurances about, and information on, the situation in Dungavel. However, to put it simply, if children were not detained, there would be no story to discuss and no reassurance to be sought.</p><p>I understand that the Border and Immigration Agency is currently exploring alternatives to detention for families. We welcome and support those initiatives. We have also urged the agency to move quickly to conclude the legacy review that affects 1,400 families in Scotland, and we have called for all of those who arrived here prior to the March 2006 agreement with the previous Administration to be given leave to remain.</p><p>In terms of legacy review cases, there are a number of issues that are of some concern. I hope that we can rapidly come to conclusions on them.</p><p>We will hold Home Office ministers and the Border and Immigration Agency to account for each and every element of the March 2006 agreement and we will press for further progress where that is in the interests of children, families and communities in Scotland. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has had an initial discussion with the immigration minister and is seeking another early meeting with him to explore those matters further. She will also raise the right to work. Many asylum seekers who have been here for some time are highly motivated and highly skilled and could contribute significantly to their communities: not allowing them to work is a missed opportunity.</p><p>I am encouraged by many of the speeches, and particularly by the unanimity on the right to work, which was mentioned by many members, including Bill Butler, Elaine Smith, Bob Doris, Bill <place-holder colnum=\"1429\"/> Aitken and Pauline McNeill&#8212;in fact, by everybody. However, as Bill Butler said, I think that Bill Aitken misunderstood the point in the motion about March 2006. That is not a rolling 18-month deadline that moves forward, but a cut-off date.</p><p>I welcome Bob Doris's speech, which brought home the reality of the situation and its effect on individuals.</p><p>Elaine Smith asked a specific question about discussions. The Border and Immigration Agency is drafting a statutory code of practice. Scottish Government officials have been involved in that and have worked to ensure that the code takes account of child protection procedures, of legislation and of all the possible effects on Scotland. The code will apply to BIA staff who work throughout the UK.</p><p>The draft code will go to the House of Lords. One matter that we are most concerned about is to ensure that Home Office ministers understand that the code will have an impact on Scotland, and that they are sure of and aware of our position on the issues that affect people in Scotland. We will pursue those matters with ministers in the near future.</p><p>At the beginning of the debate, Sandra White talked about a letter that the First Minister wrote. After meeting the Glasgow girls in Bill Butler's constituency, the First Minister took up issues that had been raised and wrote to Jacqui Smith in the UK Government. I have just received the reply from her and I will be more than happy to make copies of both letters available to Sandra White. In fairness, I will put copies of the letters in the Scottish Parliament information centre, so that other members can see them.<place-holder colnum=\"1430\"/></p><p>Asylum is a key issue for the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament. In the previous session, many members raised the need to treat asylum seekers fairly and humanely, particularly when children are involved. One of the Cabinet's earliest discussions was on asylum. The Government has moved quickly to make positive changes and to explore key concerns with our counterparts in Whitehall.</p><p>We are committed to helping and supporting the asylum-seeking community in Scotland now and in the future. That is a continuing and lasting commitment to make a continuing and lasting change for the betterment of all people in Scotland.<place-holder time=\"17:48:00\"/></p><p><em>Meeting closed at 17:48.</em></p>", "hdate": "2007-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13386707", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As other members have done, I begin by congratulating Sandra White for bringing this extremely important debate to the chamber and for securing the members' business debate on our first day back after the recess.

This year, it is &#163;79,000, which is an increase of 35 per cent above inflation. A lot more money has been spent, but it is not necessarily the case that a lot more houses have been delivered. We need to find ways to get much better value for the large sums of money we spend on new housing, and ways to ensure that tenants get a fair deal for the rent they pay.</p><p>This Government has inherited from the previous Administration real problems in housing that have built up over many years. It is time to act and I want to work with those in the social housing sector to identify solutions that we can afford, that will work, and that will focus on delivering what tenants want. More than that, I want to enable the sector to adapt to the challenges that it faces in a rapidly changing society.</p><p>Working with stakeholders in the coming weeks, we will develop proposals to get better value and improve the deal for existing tenants and those in housing need. We will consult on those ideas in the autumn and I hope that the consultation will enable people throughout Scotland to join the debate and offer their own ideas about how the sector should adapt and contribute to meeting our strategic objectives for Scotland. This is not just about bricks and mortar, but about making informed decisions that chime with our wider goals to create a Scotland that is wealthier and fairer, healthier, safer and stronger, smarter and greener.</p><p>One of the burning questions in my mind is whether we are getting value for the huge sums of taxpayers' money that is being ploughed into housing provision. The increasing cost of subsidy per house that I mentioned a moment ago suggests that we are not. We must get more housing for the public money we spend.<place-holder colnum=\"1052\"/></p><p>I began by stating my view that, overall, housing supply in Scotland is insufficient. I have therefore published today the Government's initial analysis of the Scottish housing market, which highlights the recent unprecedented growth in Scottish house prices. Copies have been at the back of the chamber since the report was published at 2.30.</p><p>Higher house prices act as a serious barrier to the aspirations of people who are trying to get on the housing ladder for the first time and those who are trying to move up. The study finds that such problems are especially acute in parts of rural Scotland and in Edinburgh and the Lothians, where up to 30 per cent of working households are unable to afford the cheapest accommodation. It is particularly concerning that the study shows that higher demand for housing is not being matched by an adequate supply response. Average house prices rose by 72 per cent between 2002 and 2006, but only 2 per cent more homes were built in 2006 than in 2002. Not enough homes are being built to meet our needs. Increasing housing supply overall in a way that creates vibrant, mixed and environmentally sustainable communities will be a major challenge for the Government and for local authorities, housing providers and the construction industry.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385846", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If the member waits, he will hear what I have to say during this debate, as well as the further discussions that will take place throughout the summer and the year to come.

However, it is clear from all the research&#8212;I am sure that the minister is not trying to contradict the research&#8212;that the cheaper the alcohol, the more of it is consumed and the greater the problem is, certainly in northern European countries. That is a fact.</p><p>I turn to the availability of alcohol. Between 1980 and 2003, the number of off-sales licences increased by 25 per cent in Scotland. In East Renfrewshire, where I live, the number of off-sales licences rose by 27.6 per cent over that period. There are more outlets for selling alcohol, which makes it easier to access it.</p><p>Society must ask itself striking questions about advertising. Do we want to allow alcohol to be advertised on television and radio before the watershed? Alcohol is a product for adults, so why should it be advertised in the middle of the afternoon? What about removing logos and brand names associated with alcohol from children's clothing, particularly sports shirts? I am glad that we are making progress in that respect. Such things should have been removed from children's clothing long ago, and I commend the Executive for taking action.</p><p>Supermarkets, of course, use alcohol as a loss leader and heavily advertise how cheap their drinks are. That must be controlled. For example, in late 2006, one advert from a well-known supermarket featured two men who were unable to get any more drink into the back of their hatchback car because it was so stuffed full of alcohol. Also in late 2006, another supermarket advertised the fact that its alcohol was extremely cheap by showing a man with crates of alcohol next to him and a large white van, which he was about to stuff full of alcohol. I believe that those are examples of irresponsible advertising on the part of the supermarkets and in no way reflect the kind of television advertising that we want to see for what is, for many of us, a difficult product.</p><p>Acceptability is an issue that we tend to ignore. Formerly, it was socially unacceptable for a man to be drunk in public, but that has changed. More recently, drunkenness among women has become more socially acceptable among some sections of society, in particular among younger people. That cultural shift, which should concern us all, has been encouraged and promoted by many so-<place-holder colnum=\"32867\"/> called personalities. People used to go out to socialise and to have a drink at the same time. Unfortunately, many people now go out with the specific intention of getting drunk as quickly and as cheaply as possible.</p><p>The effects of drink becoming cheaper, more widely available and heavily advertised are increased consumption&#8212;consumption has risen by 23 per cent in the United Kingdom in the past 10 years&#8212;binge drinking and increased long-term problems. Many of the health statistics that have been published in the past week are very frightening. Over and above that, not only does alcohol have costs for health but it is a factor in crime.

It was certainly interesting being a member of the Justice 2 Committee as it considered the bill, given the competing demands and views of the large number of witnesses from whom we heard.</p><p>I will talk about workers being coerced into working. I used to work on Christmas day because my father coerced me into working in his small business&#8212;so the issue of whether workers are coerced into working is not always as black and white as we sometimes think. That may be a tangential and amusing point, but the important point is that workers in small stores often have fewer rights and less opportunity to defend themselves than do workers in large stores. The bill refers only to large stores, but there are issues to do with the rights of workers in small stores and their ability to defend themselves against employers who can be keen to exploit their workers to the n<sup>th</sup> degree.</p><p>I do not believe that people have any appetite for shops to open on Christmas day. Despite its flaws, the bill has been improved by the amendments that we have agreed to this morning. I do not want either Christmas day or new year's day to become normal trading days, and I do not believe that anybody really does. However, we <place-holder colnum=\"32820\"/> now have a much more sensible balance between the competing demands on those days.</p><p>Murdo Fraser and Colin Fox cannot both be correct in their respective assertions that the trade unions and big business have won. Either only one of them is correct or, more likely, neither of them is correct.</p><p>Christmas day and new year's day are very different. Throughout the passage of the bill, Karen Whitefield has asserted that the days are similar, but there is a big difference. Although, like many others, I feel that business should be allowed to trade as freely as possible, it should not be allowed to do so at the expense of workers' rights&#8212;which brings me on to one of the biggest problems with the bill. Had this Parliament had powers over employment rights, I do not think that anybody would have introduced a bill on trading.</p><p>In effect, Karen Whitefield has spent a long time building a square peg before trying to ram it into a round hole. We all know the advert about the product that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"does exactly what it says on the tin.\"</p><p>That claim cannot be made for the bill. It is not the member's fault&#8212;she has done as much as is possible using trading laws&#8212;but, given normal circumstances and normal powers, I am sure that she would have used employment laws.</p><p>The bill will ensure that certain shops in certain circumstances will not be open for business on Christmas day&#8212;and perhaps new year's day, depending on the evidence. Shops do not open on Christmas day. I do not believe that they want to open, and nobody would expect them to. New year's day, however, is different. In some parts of the country, a limited number of shops open. They do so because there is demand, and that usually occurs in tourist centres. A reasonable argument can be made for allowing that to continue, but only if workers are willing to go in and work. I accept all members' comments about asserting the right of workers to have those two days off if they so wish. Fergus Ewing's point about workers being able to give evidence anonymously was worth while and should be considered.</p><p>Tourist centres must be allowed to grow and thrive, and we must not put unnecessary obstacles in the way of economic growth. I am, therefore, pleased that, at this late stage, we agreed to amend the bill this morning. We can now pause and consider the evidence relating to new year's day.</p><p>It has been claimed that the bill will guarantee days off, but it will not really do that; it will only stop trading. It has been claimed that the bill will keep the days special for workers, but that is true only for a minority of workers, and certainly not for <place-holder colnum=\"32821\"/> those in small shops, in railway stations or in airports, and not for workers in smaller Tesco stores, although it is true for workers in larger Tesco stores. Other members have pointed out other anomalies.</p><p>The biggest problem from the start has been the lack of robust evidence on both sides. However, we can now move forward and consider evidence on new year's day trading. We can consider whether trading will have an impact on our tourist centres, on our economy and, in particular, on the right of workers to have the day off and spend time with their families. Today's amendments have inserted important provisions into the bill, and we will support it at decision time.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13380763", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Christmas Day and New Year's Day Trading (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been interesting.

I do not know whether anyone else mentioned the adviser that we had at stage 1, but I would certainly like to thank them.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of the debate, certainly at stage 1 and particularly at stage 2, was about the maximum level of compensation, which the bill sets at &#163;20,000. It is important to emphasise yet again that that is not the normal level, but the maximum level. As Mr MacAskill said, we do not have punitive damages in this country. Instead, the sum that is awarded represents compensation for loss. The truth of what the bill is about was lost in some of the rhetoric during the early stages of the bill. Hopefully, the profession now understands what the bill is about, rather than the fear stories that were put about regarding the &#163;20,000 level.</p><p>The need for an appeals process was much debated at stage 1 and, particularly, at stage 2. Although it was an interesting debate, there has been a welcome outcome in the fact that we now have an appeals process. After listening to the evidence, I felt that there was a solid case for an independent appeals process. I hope that it will assuage some of the fears that have been raised about ECHR compliance, and I welcome the comments on the bill's ECHR compliance that the minister made earlier.</p><p>It is interesting that so little has been said today about the separation of service complaints and conduct complaints. Perhaps we talked ourselves out on that matter at stages 1 and 2, although Colin Fox raised the issue again today. I think that we will have to wait and see how that works out. If there is a problem later on, we will perhaps have to reconsider it; however, I think that we have got the balance just about right.</p><p>Bill Butler emphasised the important fact that the board will have a non-lawyer majority. That is central to the whole shift in culture that my colleague, John Swinney, mentioned. I echo his comments on that. It is very important that we have that cultural shift and move away from the problems that we have had with some lawyers in the past. It is broadly accepted by most people that it was time for a change to an independent complaints commission. That is an important shift, and it is time that we introduced that measure.<place-holder colnum=\"30527\"/></p><p>The underlying principle is that an efficient and effective lawyer should welcome a process that targets the small minority&#8212;I emphasise the fact that it is a small minority&#8212;of lawyers who are failing their clients.

There are many people in all the political parties who are interested in Scotland's historical places and artefacts and have interesting stories from their localities, constituencies or regions about the opportunities and problems that local groups face in trying to protect our heritage. Christine May's speech was excellent; it covered many issues very well.</p><p>Many local groups in Scotland do excellent work&#8212;most of them voluntarily&#8212;to try to protect our heritage. I remember going on holiday to Orkney around 20 years ago and visiting a site on a local farmer's land. The farmer and his wife had built a little museum, which was attached to their <place-holder colnum=\"29172\"/> house. There were jet objects in it and other ancient objects that they had gathered from the site. They would take people down to the site and show them it. People were not charged&#8212;the work that the farmer and his wife did was entirely voluntary because they were keen to protect the site that was on their land.</p><p>This year, I was on holiday on the Cowal peninsula, just outside Dunoon. Local groups there are working well to provide guided walks and materials that show people some of the area's history. Some of that history is ancient. Local groups are doing tremendous work.</p><p>When we discuss Scotland's historical places and artefacts we tend to ask how much things will cost and how much effort a Government or a local authority must put in to save sites. Of course, cost is not the only issue; great opportunities exist. Christine May mentioned tourism. I presume that on the two holidays that I mentioned we added money to the local economies by spending on hotels, drinks, meals and so on, although we went to those areas because we were interested in what was happening on the archaeological sites there.</p><p>In the West of Scotland, which is my region, the Romans left their mark with the Antonine wall and the good people of Largs saw off the Vikings from Scotland at the battle of Largs. Great opportunities exist for local communities to benefit their economies by marketing their areas using historical events, sites and artefacts. Largs has been successful in doing so in recent years. People used to have to visit the Vikingar centre to see what was going on in the area.</p><p>Other areas have been less successful than Largs. Because of the west of Scotland's history of occupation and industrialisation, it is almost inevitable that many sites there have been lost under building work and heavy industry. That is unfortunate, but not everything has gone. Much is left that could and must be preserved. I am glad to say that all parties are beginning to turn their attention to such problems. I should also commend the Executive for doing so.</p><p>I heartily commend local groups across the country on their work, but it is clear that we need a national framework and strategy to ensure that there is sufficient protection throughout Scotland.</p><p>I support the listing of buildings, which has proved useful over the years in protecting many buildings, although, as Christine May mentioned, it does not always work in the way in which we would like it to. However, we must go further and introduce a similar system for other historic sites.</p><p>I would like to raise some issues that may need to be considered when we discuss introducing such a system. The system should protect a broad <place-holder colnum=\"29173\"/> array of historic sites. Often when we think of historic sites we think only of neolithic burials or standing stones, but we must think of the history of local areas in a much broader way. Perhaps we should use Historic Scotland's categorisation system to prioritise sites for preservation. We must be honest and practical about the fact that not everything deserves the same level of protection; clearly, some sites are more important to us than others. We must also apply a minimum standard for preservation at both national and local level, because of the variation that exists across the country. In some areas, local groups find it difficult to secure protection for sites, but in others that is much easier.</p><p>Much work needs to be done in order for us to catch up with some other countries. I am thinking especially of the USA, where some marvellous battlefield sites, in particular, are protected in a way that is not the case here. Other landscapes such as gardens and other outdoor areas are also important. Christine May mentioned some examples in her opening speech.</p><p>Protecting our historical places and artefacts is critical to us as a people. It helps us to learn about where we all came from and about the events that have shaped not only our country and culture, but even our gene pool&#8212;all the visitors who have come to this part of the world over many thousands of years. I support Christine May's questions to the minister and hope that when the minister winds up the debate she will address some of the points that Christine made about where we go from here to protect some of these important sites.</p>", "hdate": "2006-11-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13370895", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historical Places and Artefacts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Christine May on securing the debate.

We talk about it all the time as if it is an industrial product, and we are used, certainly in the west of Scotland, to all the terrible diseases that result from its use, particularly in the ship-building industry. Therefore, I was surprised to find out that asbestos is in fact a Greek word that means inextinguishable and that it has been in use for more than 2,000 years.</p><p>It is all the more surprising that we ended up using asbestos so widely in industry in the 20<sup>th</sup> century when we discover that almost 2,000 years ago Pliny the elder&#8212;23 to 79 AD&#8212;wrote about the sickness of the lungs that affected the slaves who wove asbestos into cloth. In other words, nearly 2,000 years ago people observed the connection between asbestos and a disease of the lungs, but nearly 2,000 years later we were using asbestos on a daily basis in most of our heavy industry in the west of Scotland and in other parts of Scotland.</p><p>It is clear, from the industrial revolution and the fact that Scotland was so involved in that process, why mesothelioma strikes so heavily in Scotland. Asbestos is responsible for 90 per cent of mesothelioma cases. Unfortunately, the area with the highest standardised mortality rate from the disease is West Dunbartonshire, in the west of Scotland, which has a rate that is more than six times the average for Britain. Other areas in Scotland that have high rates are Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, East Dunbartonshire, Glasgow and, as Shona Robison said, Tayside. They are <place-holder colnum=\"28117\"/> industrialised areas that have suffered the results of that industrialisation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the median survival period from diagnosis ranges from about nine to 13 months. Anything that extends that short period and improves the quality of life for those who suffer from mesothelioma should be supported.</p><p>I have two short quotes on the subject. The first is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Over 18 weeks, patients treated with pemetrexed\"&#8212;</p><p>no wonder we call it Alimta&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"plus cisplatin demonstrated statistically significant symptomatic improvements when compared with those who received cisplatin alone.\"</p><p>The second is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The results of the EMPHACIS trial suggest that\"</p><p>Alimta</p><p class=\"indent\">\"plus cisplatin confers a survival benefit of approximately 3 months, compared with cisplatin alone.\"</p><p>The surprising thing about those quotes is that they come not from doctors or those who support the use of Alimta, but from the NICE document that, despite those statements, ended up rejecting the use of the drug.</p><p>As members have said, an extension of three months is a quarter to a third of the expected lifespan of those who are unfortunate enough to be diagnosed with the disease. It is a substantial amount of time for somebody who has been given only nine months to live. Who would deny patients the right to that extra life? It is extremely surprising that NICE rejected the use of the drug. The reasons for that cannot be clinical, so they must be financial. We all accept that finance comes into the decisions on such matters and that it must do so. However, I am puzzled by the NICE decision. I hope that the appeal is successful and that NICE overturns its original decision.</p><p>I am delighted that the SMC decided to support the use of the drug in Scotland, but the problem is that, because of the decision south of the border by NICE, the danger exists that it may be withdrawn in Scotland, not for current patients but for possible future patients. The circumstances in Scotland are different. As I said, the case rate in Scotland is six times greater than that in the rest of the UK, which is why NHS QIS must support the continued use of Alimta in Scotland. In the words of Professor Nick Thatcher, the professor of medical oncology at the University of Manchester,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Alimta and cisplatin is the only licensed treatment for mesothelioma patients and has been shown not only to increase quality of life but also to extend life\".</p><p>As members have said, there is no other option.

To get a bill to this stage is no mean achievement for a back bencher. I hope that members will agree to pass the bill at stage 1 so that it will progress to stage 2 and eventually become law. A holiday for St Andrew's day is, of course, a long-standing Scottish National Party <place-holder colnum=\"28064\"/> policy, so we welcome this first step towards making that day a holiday.</p><p>Scotland has among the lowest number of bank holidays in Europe: we have eight, while other countries in Europe have 10 or 12 and some have even more. An extra day's holiday for Scots would therefore still leave us with well below the average number of bank holidays in Europe.</p><p>Some people have given the impression that the business community in its entirety is against having an extra day's holiday, but that is simply not true. Dennis Canavan mentioned the Scottish Retail Consortium. The SRC supplied the Enterprise and Culture Committee with figures that showed that sales from a St Andrew's day holiday on a Monday could represent as much as &#163;88 million, which would be an increase of almost &#163;30 million on sales on a normal Monday. The Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions said that an additional bank holiday would encourage important growth in the tourism industry, particularly from the domestic market. If we are serious about growing our tourism market by 50 per cent over the next 10 years, initiatives such as an extra bank holiday are exactly what we need, rather than robbing Peter to pay Paul by taking a holiday away from elsewhere in the year.</p><p>St Andrew's day could be the linchpin in a tourism marketing campaign that would take us from the autumn gold campaign to the hogmanay celebrations and on through the Celtic connections festival in Glasgow. A series of winter festivals for tourists would do a great deal to boost tourism&#8212;we could use St Andrew's day as the launch pad for those festivals.</p><p>Those who are feart of an extra holiday on St Andrew's day need look no further than Ireland to see the potential of such a holiday. Ireland uses St Patrick's day to help to grow its tourism industry and its export markets, and to attract people to do business in and with Ireland. An economic survey found that St Patrick's day is worth &#8364;80 million to Dublin alone. Money is spent on food, drink, transport, accommodation and tickets for events. Some 29 per cent of people who visit Dublin are from overseas and 47 per cent of them come specifically for the St Patrick's day celebrations&#8212;in fact, 81 per cent said that they would return to Ireland because of the experience of their St Patrick's day trip.</p><p>St Patrick's day is an enormous success worldwide. It allows Ireland to sell Ireland the brand around the world and provides a marketing opportunity that most countries would give their right arm for. Professor Tom Devine, of the centre for Irish and Scottish studies, has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is no accident that the Irish have raised their national profile above those of their neighbours.\"<place-holder colnum=\"28065\"/></p><p>He went on to say that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is a hard one to quantify in terms of Irish punts, but their celebration and marketing of St Patrick's Day has been a huge factor in the Irish economic miracle.\"</p><p>Normal countries around the world have a day on which to celebrate their history and culture, but Scotland has for far too long lacked such a day, which would give us a platform for the expansion of a celebration of all things Scottish and give a particular boost to our artistic and cultural communities. The SNP believes that it would be a fantastic opportunity for Scotland and its people if we were to fully embrace a St Andrew's day holiday. We need to put into practice what the Irish have already done; we need to learn that lesson. If we do that, we will reap the rewards. If we do not, it will be because of the feart-of-anything-Scottish faction on the Lib-Lab benches who oppose an extra holiday for Scots.</p><p>The SNP will support the bill. However, if the proposal is simply to substitute St Andrew's day for another holiday, that is not good enough and the bill does not go far enough. Next May, voters will get the chance to elect an SNP Government led by Alex Salmond. That Government will not rob Scots of one of their precious holidays; instead, we will ensure that Scotland gets an extra day's holiday to celebrate our history and culture and to market Scotland as the ideal place to visit and in which to live, work, do business and enjoy a day off.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368213", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Dennis Canavan on getting his bill this far.

The subject is important and affects not just the residents of Penicuik but the wider community of Midlothian, because the closure of facilities generates a ripple effect on people in the surrounding area. The issue is worthy of debate, but I deprecate the remarks of Jeremy Purvis, who made petty and irrelevant comments rather than deal with the issue at hand.</p><p>The loss of community facilities is a story that is unfortunately being repeated, not just in Penicuik and Midlothian, but throughout Scotland. There is no doubt that local government budgets are being squeezed and that decisions are being made&#8212;as Derek Brownlee said&#8212;such that leisure facilities are unfortunately often first to go. In my area&#8212;East Renfrewshire&#8212;swimming pools are constantly under threat. Pool opening hours are being cut and the community pool in Neilston is often the main target of such cuts.<place-holder colnum=\"27471\"/></p><p>The replacement of facilities is welcome, but when multiple facilities in communities are replaced with a centralised facility, there is no like-for-like replacement. The new centralised facility is often smaller with fewer rooms, and is certainly not as handy for people to travel to as were the old facilities in people's communities. The building of a new facility is welcome, but other facilities are often lost when that happens.</p><p>Christine Grahame, Colin Fox and Chris Ballance, in particular, talked about the lack of consultation in the context of the Penicuik facilities. Again, the problem is not exclusive to Midlothian and Penicuik. I will cite an example that might serve as a warning to other communities. The Liberal-Labour run East Renfrewshire Council decided to cut the opening hours of local libraries. The council balloted people in the area and asked them, \"Do you want the library to open for X hours or Y hours?\" The council did not mention that both options represented cuts in library opening hours&#8212;the libraries had previously had much longer opening hours. Consultation is good, but it should be meaningful and it should offer people a real choice about what they want for their local libraries, swimming pools or other community and leisure facilities.</p><p>The sharing of facilities with schools is good for the schools in question but, as Colin Fox appropriately pointed out, it provides restricted access for other people in the community. By their nature, facilities in schools are more difficult to access because they are part of the school rather than part of the community. People often feel slightly resistant to going to a school to use facilities&#8212;maybe that is wrong, but they view the facilities as the school's facilities. Another point is that schools use the facilities five days a week, so they are not available during that time to residents of the area.</p><p>The Executive has worthwhile targets on cutting obesity, on fit kids and on reducing antisocial behaviour. Those are welcome and we all support them, but if we do not have community leisure facilities, we will not tackle the problems of a generation of young people who are more interested in sitting in front of a computer than they are in going to the local football pitch or badminton court with their friends to enjoy themselves, or in being active and fit and growing into healthy adults. As members have mentioned, without such facilities, young people hang about on street corners and, whether intentionally or not, cause distress to residents. We end up with conflict in communities, which often leads to further antisocial behaviour. That is unwelcome.</p><p>Community leisure facilities have an important role in fighting obesity, tackling antisocial behaviour and making communities cohesive. <place-holder colnum=\"27472\"/></p><p>That is what we should aim for&#8212;we should not close such facilities.

It is wonderful to hear their sudden interest in that piece of legislation.</p><p>As far as the bill is concerned, it has been widely accepted that, in this day and age, the current set-up for overseeing lawyers is unsustainable. Frankly, a change to the system has been long overdue. However, the fundamental question, certainly for committee members, has been whether the bill goes far enough in dealing with the split between conduct and service complaints. One general debate in committee&#8212;and, indeed, in the chamber today&#8212;has centred on whether the Executive's interpretation of that split is correct or whether, as Colin Fox and John Swinney suggested, we should go the whole way and have a one-stop shop for those making complaints.</p><p>I have to say that, in weighing up the evidence in committee, I was attracted to the single-door policy. After all, many of those who gave evidence found it difficult to define the split clearly. For example, the Law Society of Scotland said that it was very easy to split service and conduct complaints, while the Faculty of Advocates said that it was impossible to do so. The fact that even lawyers could not agree on the matter illustrates the difficulty of the problem.<place-holder colnum=\"27375\"/></p><p>In the end, we had to take a reasoned approach. Many gave compelling evidence about the difference between conduct and service complaints. That was a reasoned argument that won the day for me, but only the future will tell us whether it is correct. The bottom line is that it is not possible to please all the people all the time and, no matter what we decide, some people will be unhappy with what we do.</p><p>The main focus has been on hybrid cases&#8212;many members have focused on that problem. Will such cases start out in one camp and move to the other? Nobody is sure where they will end up. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a suck-it-and-see situation and the commission and the Law Society will have to deal with it as they go along. That may not be as wonderfully clear as we would like to make it, but it is perhaps the best way forward. However, the commission's oversight over conduct cases will be important. John Swinney finished on that point, on which I agree with him. If the commission has such oversight and it is robust, which I hope it will be, that might quell some of the fears that some have expressed.</p><p>The point that Gordon Jackson made on the difference between conduct and service complaints was important. There is a range of issues that are clearly conduct issues and do not involve other parties. If a lawyer is involved in a criminal case because he was drink driving, singing certain songs or doing something else that was exclusively to do with conduct and nothing to do with clients, should an outside body such as the commission deal with that case? Such issues are definitely conduct issues. Therefore, it is clear that there is a split to be made and that is why I come down in support of the split.</p><p>Many members have talked about the independence of the legal profession and of the proposed complaints commission and about ECHR compliance. I am not a lawyer and I do not know whether the bill is ECHR compliant. I take the word of the minister and his legal advisers, who say that it is, but there are a number of questions on independence. The Executive has gone some of the way towards answering some of those questions. In particular, I welcome the introduction of fixed-term appointments and the creation of a partial role for the Lord President in removing commission members. That is certainly a step in the right direction towards dealing with some of the concerns. One of the biggest steps in the right direction is the removal of the powers of direction, which the minister mentioned in his speech. That must assuage many of the fears about the legal profession's independence.</p><p>I move on to the lack of a right to an external appeal. When he gave evidence, the minister talked about the process by which appeals could <place-holder colnum=\"27376\"/> be made within sub-committees&#8212;if I can call them that&#8212;of the commission. I still have a great problem with that. It does not go far enough; there is a good and solid case for a right to an external appeal on the ground of fairness alone, whether or not the bill's proposals are ECHR compliant. I do not support the setting up of yet another tribunal or bureaucratic mechanism, so perhaps a right to an external appeal to the court is the answer. That will have to be considered at stage 2.</p><p>Not many members talked about costs or the Finance Committee's report, which is a good report that is at annex A of the Justice 2 Committee's report. I will give two quick quotations from it. Paragraph 22 the Finance Committee's report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee believes there should be a more effective power of strategic financial scrutiny over the costs of the Commission to avoid the creation of a needless bureaucracy\",</p><p>and paragraph 27 says that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it would have been beneficial for both the Law Society and the Committee if the background to the Executive's assumptions had been provided in the Financial Memorandum.\"</p><p>The Executive has rather let itself down with the financial memorandum. It could have been much more robust and helpful and provided much more information. Many members have concerns about the size of the commission. I was surprised&#8212;as many members were&#8212;by the assumption of 55 staff and by the commission's overall size; it seems much bigger than we expected it to be.</p><p>There has been too much focus on the maximum compensation figure of &#163;20,000. That figure is the maximum and, in the vast majority of cases, compensation will be much lower. I understand the Law Society's and lawyers' fears on that, but we should think about the fact that it is a maximum.</p><p>Oversight of the master policy and the guarantee fund by the SLCC is good and I welcome it. I also welcome the changes to civil legal aid that the minister announced today.</p><p>I do not have time to go into some of the other points that I have, but I am sure that many of them will come up at stage 2. I reiterate the point, which my colleague Kenny MacAskill made, that we will support the bill's general principles.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13366367", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I must welcome the Conservatives' conversion to the merits of the ECHR.

I certainly took a long time to get used to the process; there is a steep learning curve for those who join the Subordinate Legislation Committee.</p><p>It is no wonder that members steer clear of the committee when they hear about affirmative orders; negative orders; draft affirmative orders; draft negative orders; super-affirmative orders; the 21-day rule; the 40-day rule; the 28-day emergency rule; Henry VIII powers; and laying orders before making orders, unless they are made before they are laid. The list goes on; the process is complex and difficult to understand. The system is opaque, with archaic rules and language. It is designed to put people off, but it does not need to be that way. The report sets out the reasons why that is the case.<place-holder colnum=\"26465\"/></p><p>When we visited Westminster, we asked MPs whether, if they had the chance to design a system to deal with subordinate legislation from scratch, they would design the system that they have currently. After the laughter died down, they said \"absolutely not\". They are stuck with their system because it has been built up over a long time.</p><p>When we began our inquiry, most, if not all, members of the committee thought that what we had to do was fix the current system. We could tinker around the edges, make a few changes, add a few bits in and take a few bits away and end up with a system that was fit for purpose. However, as the inquiry progressed and we spent more time considering the issues, it became clear that we should go back to first principles and ask the fundamental questions: what is the purpose of subordinate legislation and why do we have it? Once we had addressed those questions, it became obvious that we had to design a bespoke system for subordinate legislation that was fit for the new Parliament and that such a system would not be an amended version of the current system but a new, simple, straightforward, clear and easily understood system. That led us to devise the SSIP.</p><p>One of the problems with the current system is that it forces the Parliament and its committees to waste time going through the motions&#8212;no pun intended&#8212;with some SSIs, while not allowing enough time to scrutinise those that are important. The SSIP will allow Parliament to concentrate on the instruments that matter. It will allow committees to see the upcoming instruments and focus their efforts on those that are controversial or of particular relevance or importance. At the same time, committees will be able to deal quickly with routine and uncontroversial instruments. Parallel consideration by the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the lead committee will mean that lead committees will have a maximum of 40 days, rather than the current 20 days, in which to do their work. The SSIP will also allow committees to deal with routine instruments in much less time than it takes at the moment.</p><p>The system will focus attention where it should be focused. It will free up the time of ministers and officials, who will no longer have to attend committees when it is not necessary to do so. How many lead committee meetings have we attended to which a minister comes along and makes a statement on an instrument, after which there are no questions and no debate and the instrument is just voted through? That is a waste of ministers' and officials' time. They should come to committees to discuss SSIs only when it is relevant and the committee thinks that it is appropriate to have a debate and ask questions.<place-holder colnum=\"26466\"/></p><p>One of the other great advantages of the SSIP is that all instruments will be laid in draft and will be able to be modified to remove technical and typographical errors without the clock stopping, although not to make policy changes, for a number of obvious reasons. Last week I asked the committee clerks, half jokingly, how many typographical errors we advised the Executive of informally in the past year. The number was about 400. I had thought that there were more than that, but it is still an incredible number of typographical and minor errors that could be corrected if we were allowed to modify the instruments without the clock stopping. Providing for changing the draft instruments for technical reasons is a good and sensible suggestion. It will result in a real saving in time and effort for everybody, because there will be no need to withdraw instruments and re-lay them or to introduce amending instruments in the future. I believe that that process will mean that&#8212;at the point of making the instruments&#8212;Scotland will have some of the most error-free instruments of any Parliament in the world.</p><p>On the face of it, it could appear that we are lessening parliamentary scrutiny procedures because every instrument is effectively a draft&#8212;or a negative, to use the old terminology. However, the opposite is the case: scrutiny will be increased. Last year, only 84 of 500 instruments were subject to the affirmative procedure. The rest were subject to the negative procedure, which means that they go through no real procedure in the Parliament. The SSIP will allow us to focus on the real instruments and deal quickly with those on which we do not need to spend time.</p><p>I am not sure that there is a cutting edge of subordinate legislation, but if there is such a thing, what is in the report is probably it. It will generate interest in Parliaments and legislatures around the world in what we are thinking and how we are developing the use of secondary legislation.</p><p>The SSIP is an example of better regulation in general. We want to sweep away from regulation the nonsense, bureaucracy and unnecessary rules and that is also what we want the proposed SSIP to do&#8212;we are sweeping away what is unnecessary and focusing on what is important.</p><p>The detail of the report is irrelevant in many ways; it will be the subject matter of a later debate. It is the bigger picture that is important&#8212;what we are doing and where we want to go. We will get into the detail as we go through the debate thereafter. That is why we have presented a draft report and why we framed it in that way.</p><p>I echo what the convener said: this new Parliament has a once-in-a-lifetime chance to put in place a system that is fit for purpose and designed for the needs of a 21<sup>st</sup> century Parliament, rather than a 19<sup>th</sup> century one.

The minister described it as technical and administrative and it has not received a lot of attention, but it is an important step forward.</p><p>The creation of the Scottish crime and drug enforcement agency received a lot more attention during stage 1 and stage 2. There was a lot of discussion of how such a national agency would fit into the overall police structure. I am reassured that we are placing the agency on a level at which it can tackle crime throughout Scotland and cross-border and international crime and work with colleagues from throughout Europe and the rest of the world on an equal footing. Members of the committee felt that it was important that the title of the head of the agency should reflect that.</p><p>The creation of the police complaints commissioner for Scotland is welcome and overdue. There was an argument about whether dealing with police complaints should have been part of another ombudsman's remit and whether the commissioner should carry out completely independent investigations. We have reached a sensible compromise. The public will generally be happier with the complaints process; it will be seen to be independent and when the commissioner is reviewing cases, they will be able to appoint others, outside the police, to investigate if they feel that that is necessary.</p><p>The introduction of football banning orders is particularly welcome. Mr Davidson was not involved in scrutinising the bill at stage 1. A number of members of the committee, including Bill Butler and me, went to an old firm game, which was an interesting experience. Bill Aitken said that he was not that keen on the idea of football banning orders, despite CCTV, and that other methods of dealing with the problem could be used. The evidence from England and Wales was clear that football banning orders had been effective there. We should always look to learn from best practice, no matter where it comes from. Football banning orders are an important step forward in public safety.</p><p>On public processions, I remain to be convinced that the steps that we have taken will be as effective as many people hope that they will be. I hope that they will be and that they will result in communities feeling more calm and reassured about processions in their area and in the marchers still being allowed to march wherever they see fit, as long as the march does not too greatly upset the communities through which it will go.

Are there checks and balances in the system? Yes. Are civil liberties protected? Yes&#8212;they are protected by the process. What is the purpose of the amendments? They seek to close a loophole. Once those questions have been asked and answered, it is clear that we should support the amendments. I congratulate Bill Butler on seeking to close that loophole through lodging his amendments. We will support them.</p><p>I move on to Paul Martin's amendments and start with amendments 204 and 205. The same questions have to be asked about them. If child or person under the age of 18 is found guilty of an offence that would, had the offender been 18 or over, have resulted in retention of the offender's DNA, should that DNA be destroyed or not retained just because the offender is under 18? The answer is that it should not. Has a threat been identified? Yes. Has a process been gone through? Yes. Amendments 204 and 205 would <place-holder colnum=\"26065\"/> provide a three-step process, which would involve the children's panel, the principal reporter, the chief constable of the area in which the offence is supposed to have taken place and a sheriff. It seems to me that the amendments would provide a legitimate process to establish that there is a threat.</p><p>In the case of amendment 205, the child offender has put up his hands, admitted his guilt and accepted the grounds of referral. Frankly, if the offender accepts the grounds of referral and it is clear that due process has been gone through, it is equally right that we should close the loophole so that the DNA of under-18s who have been involved in such activity will be retained because they are a threat. It is entirely reasonable to do that.</p><p>Amendment 206, however, is a completely different type of amendment. We should ask the same questions about it as we asked about the previous amendments. Has a threat been identified? No. The amendment would result in retention of DNA samples of everyone regardless of their guilt or otherwise. Does the amendment provide a process? No&#8212;retention would apply to everyone. Does it provide checks and balances? No it does not. Would civil liberties be protected? No, they would not; the DNA of everyone who was arrested for an imprisonable offence would be retained, which is not acceptable.</p><p>The purpose of amendment 206 is not to close a loophole but to move us down the road of having a DNA database of everybody irrespective of their guilt or otherwise.

Those fires resulted in 1,858 non-fatal casualties and 76 fatalities. Of the 76 deaths, 30 were caused by cigarettes or other tobacco products. Smoking-related fires in the home are the most dangerous type of fire because they are far more likely to kill and injure people than other domestic fires. In 2004, smoking materials were the cause of 44 per cent of fatal fires in dwellings. The next highest cause was cooking appliances, which were responsible for 26 per cent of fatalities, followed by space heaters and candles, which accounted for 6 per cent each. The figures clearly show that, for fatal fires in the home, cigarettes are far and away the biggest single source of fires. We need to confront that fact and tackle the problem at source.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a way of doing just that. Reduced ignition potential cigarettes&#8212;more commonly known as self-extinguishing or fire-safe cigarettes&#8212;are designed to go out after a short <place-holder colnum=\"25878\"/> time if they are not actively smoked. Small bands of slightly thicker paper along the length of the cigarette prevent the cigarette from burning down completely. In other words, RIP cigarettes do not smoulder. That is vital for fire safety, as research from both the US and the United Kingdom shows that smouldering cigarettes are responsible for nine out of 10 smoking-related fire deaths. Research published in the UK shows that fire-safe cigarettes could cut the number of accidental house fires that are caused by smouldering cigarettes by as much as two thirds.</p><p>Fire research report 8 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Fires started by smokers' materials tend to result in more property damage than other fires, on average four times higher than fires caused by other methods.\"</p><p>The savings to the Scottish economy of preventing such fires are self-evident.</p><p>The tobacco industry has dismissed such research. However, we no longer have to rely on laboratory experiments alone, because we now have a real example of what happens when fire-safe cigarettes are made compulsory. Canada and the US states of New York, Vermont and California have made fire-safe cigarettes mandatory. New York state is the first to have the new law in place, and the results speak for themselves. In the first year after the law came into effect, the number of people killed by cigarette-related fires fell by almost a third. People are alive today because of the introduction of fire-safe cigarettes in New York. In Scotland, that could mean 10 fewer deaths, 300 fewer non-fatal casualties and a reduction in the number of fires in the home by 1,000 or more. Those are extremely conservative estimates. Compulsory fire-safe cigarettes could result in a reduction of between a third and a half in smoking-related fires and fire deaths. Some research puts the figure as high as a reduction of between two thirds and three quarters.</p><p>Whatever the figure may be, the fact is that introducing fire-safe cigarettes would save lives, stop injuries and prevent fires. Unsurprisingly, a number of other US states are actively considering introducing fire-safe cigarette laws. Unfortunately, the tobacco industry has been using its influence, its money and a campaign of disinformation to block the introduction of those laws. In Maryland, the vote on the fire-safe cigarette bill was 124 in favour and 12 against. However, two senators filibustered the final session and blocked the introduction of the law. One of them was Maryland state senator George Della, who admits that he receives campaign funds from tobacco firms, although he claims that the tobacco firms do not own him. Perhaps they do not own him, but they rent him and his vote by the hour. Those tactics are not surprising, but they are disreputable.<place-holder colnum=\"25879\"/></p><p>In 1994, the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We do not know how to make a cigarette that exhibits reduced ignition propensity that is consumer acceptable ... extensive consumer testing showed that they are not marketable\".</p><p>That was a lie&#8212;there is no other word for it. Internal tobacco company documents prove that they have known for more than 20 years how to make such cigarettes. On the issue of market acceptability, documents from RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris show that, when they consumer-tested fire-safe cigarettes, those were equally acceptable to smokers. In blind tests, smokers could not tell the difference. They look and taste the same as normal cigarettes. Unfortunately, they are just as addictive and damaging to the health of smokers, but they cut dramatically the number of fires that are caused by cigarettes.</p><p>I hope that when he responds to the debate, the minister will not try to use the excuse that the issue is reserved, because I do not accept that argument. I accept that product design is a reserved matter, but fire safety is devolved. What I propose is clearly a fire safety measure. When I proposed a ban on smoking in enclosed public places, many people said that the matter was reserved, because health and safety is reserved. Instead, we introduced a public health law, because public health is devolved. That was a creative use of our powers. In the same way, we can use our powers over fire safety to make fire-safe cigarettes compulsory in Scotland. We can lead the way in Europe on the issue.</p><p>In conclusion, I point out that the measure is supported by many organisations, especially the Fire Brigades Union and the Chief Fire Officers Association Scotland. The FBU said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Stewart Maxwell's initiative will constitute a huge advance in Fire Safety and will serve to make a significant reduction in Scotland's atrocious fire deaths record.\"</p><p>On behalf of the Chief Fire Officers Association Scotland, Assistant Chief Officer McGillivray said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Fire-safe cigarettes would dramatically reduce fire deaths in Scotland and the Association calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce legislation to that effect.\"</p><p>Dr Jeff Wigand, of whom many members will have heard, is a former tobacco industry scientist turned whistleblower. He found out about this debate through the web and this afternoon he sent me an e-mail. In it he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I applauded the Scottish Parliament for introducing its smoking regulations. Now I urge it to demonstrate the same duty of care by introducing legislation requiring reduced ignition potential cigarettes, which are already saving lives in the US.\"</p><p>Dr Wigand said that he would try to watch the debate on the web, and I hope that he gets the <place-holder colnum=\"25880\"/> chance to see it.

In our report, we point out:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"ACPOS was concerned that the onus will be on Scotland to identify matters upon which it would seek to be consulted by the NPIA and that this may not be sufficient to protect Scotland's interests.\"</p><p>I understand that the minister has assured the committee that if any matters impact on Scotland a separate subcommittee&#8212;if that is the correct term&#8212;will be established, which will contain representation from the Scottish police. If so, I welcome that move to protect Scottish interests.</p><p>As certain reserved matters in the bill would or could impact heavily on Scottish citizens, the committee also took some time to discuss them. It can come as no surprise that much of the interest in this Sewel motion relates to the provisions in the Police and Justice Bill that cover reserved matters. I certainly make no apology for using my time to talk about the extradition issues that the bill raises.</p><p>Our responsibility in this Parliament is to stand up for the Scottish interest and for Scottish citizens, irrespective of the niceties of the current constitutional arrangement. As a result, the Scottish National Party will support the amendment moved by David Davidson on behalf of the Justice 2 Committee. In fact, the Parliament should note that a committee made up of members from five different political parties was unanimous in its support for the amendment and its serious concerns about certain aspects of the Westminster bill.</p><p>No Scottish citizen should be extradited to the US while the US fails to sign its half of the treaty. For that matter, Scottish citizens should not be extradited to anywhere else that fails to sign such treaties. We should not support a one-sided treaty. When the treaty was being debated, it was said that it was needed as part of the war on terror, but the US is now using it to extradite people who have nothing to do with the war on terror. In fact, the US is using the treaty to try to extradite people who have been accused of what is commonly referred to as white-collar crime; the Internal Revenue Service has been heavily involved in that process. We are obliged by the terms of the Extradition Act 2003 to send people to the US&#8212;without, as Jackie Baillie clearly pointed out, proper hearings or prima facie evidence of their guilt or involvement&#8212;but America is under no reciprocal obligation. That cannot be right. In fact, people can be extradited to the US when they are accused of crimes that were committed wholly or mainly in this country.<place-holder colnum=\"25344\"/></p><p>The committee was concerned about the possibility of situations arising in which Scottish citizens could be extradited on the basis of a charge that the Lord Advocate has already marked \"no proceedings\" here in Scotland. Jackie Baillie referred to that in some detail. However, I noted that, during questions to the ministers with responsibility for justice this afternoon, the Lord Advocate confirmed that that was indeed possible. He said that, even though he had marked a case \"no proceedings\" and had given the individual concerned a letter stating that no further proceedings would ever be taken against them in connection with the charge in question, it would be open to Governments in other countries to continue to move against that citizen and to have him or her extradited. That is a matter of grave concern.</p><p>However, I do not blame the USA for the situation, because what is happening is not its fault. The failure, unfortunately, lies with the UK Government, because it was the UK Government that agreed to send citizens of this country to the US before the US signed the treaty. It is the fault of the UK Government in London that people can be extradited from the UK to the US when the US refuses to reciprocate.</p><p>There are a number of options, some of which have been suggested in debates at Westminster. Perhaps we could do the same as happens in Ireland at the moment, by incorporating article 7 of the European convention on extradition, which allows a country to refuse extradition if the offence is deemed to have been committed in whole or in part on its territory. A small, simple, one-line amendment to the Police and Justice Bill that is currently being considered at Westminster would allow that to happen, and I believe that certain parties at Westminster are considering tabling such an amendment.</p><p>What can the Scottish Parliament do about it? Unfortunately, we can do virtually nothing except ask the UK Government to take note of our concerns. I know that, when they are caught in such a bind, members of other parties sometimes wring their hands and try to ensure that the UK Government does something, but the reality is that this Parliament is completely impotent on reserved matters. The only viable and logical option to such problems is independence. If Scotland were a normal, independent country with a proper Parliament that had full powers, we could&#8212;and I believe that we would&#8212;act in defence of our citizens. In fact, we would never have allowed such a situation to have arisen in the first place. I support the amendment, but it is a poor substitute for having the ability to act for ourselves.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361035", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police and Justice Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the minister, Mr Davidson and Ms Baillie have made clear, the bill's main impact on Parliament's devolved responsibilities is its replacement of the Police Information Technology Organisation and the Central Police Training and Development Authority with the NPIA.

Although I take great pleasure in the successes that my daughter enjoys, I am also concerned about some of the pressures that our children are under in the current structure.</p><p>Like all the members who have spoken so far, I welcomed the review. It is incredibly important that we never let the system lapse or leave it to be ignored. The system must move on and evolve at all stages and must be kept relevant and up to date. That is particularly important, because children have to be taught how to learn. They should not be made simply to remember dates and a series of pieces of information; they must have skills for the future, particularly in the world that we face today and in the knowledge economy that children now grow up in. The world of work that they will enter is much more dependent on their ability to learn, to change, to evolve and to develop, and they must have the skills to do that.</p><p>I am generally pleased with the thrust of the review so far, which has much to commend it, but there are some concerns. The minister touched on a couple of those in his opening speech. There are some phrases that I furrowed my brow about. For example, there are references to \"curriculum areas\" rather than to subjects; \"curriculum areas\" sounds fine and there must be a cross-cutting approach in many areas, but some teachers and parents are worried about the loss or possible downgrading of certain subjects. I was also struck by the phrase</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Substantial simplification and prioritisation of the curriculum\".</p><p>If that means what I think it means, that is good, but I hope that it does not mean lesson downgrading. I am sure that it does not and that the minister will ensure that that is not the case.</p><p>As I said, there is a great deal of concern about what is happening in certain areas. The fear is that <place-holder colnum=\"24635\"/> that will result in certain subjects being lost. I know that other members will mention their own favourite subjects&#8212;I heard Sylvia Jackson say that Frank McAveety will talk about physical education. I certainly want to put in a plea for the social sciences, because it is extremely important that the social sciences&#8212;geography, economics, modern studies and particularly history&#8212;are kept in the curriculum. I have an honours degree in social sciences and have no doubt that those subjects provide a broad grounding in a range of areas to do with society and the approach that we take in our modern, western society.</p><p>I make a general plea for social sciences, but I want to talk about history in particular. There has been a great deal of concern and worry, as the minister said in his opening remarks, that history might be removed and spread among other subjects and not be taught as a separate core subject. If we do not know what our history is, we are lost, as individuals and as a country. We have to know where we came from in order to understand our place in the world and where we are going in the future. I see Peter Peacock nodding at that; I am sure that he understands the importance of that subject.</p><p>Teaching history, particularly Scottish history, is vital if we are to understand our place in the world. It allows us to put Scotland in its context, in the past, present and future. It would be better if we taught more social science and more history rather than less. When I was at school the amount of history&#8212;in particular Scottish history&#8212;that I was taught was almost zero, if it was not zero. I was not taught about the Celts, Wallace, Bruce or the wars of independence. I was not even taught about the declaration of Arbroath. There was nothing in the curriculum about Scotland's ancient trading and economic links with other parts of Europe or its cultural links. There was nothing about the Darien experiment or even the Act of Union. That was a failing in the history that I was taught. I had to learn about those subjects as an adult. I think that the teaching of Scottish history has improved over the years and I hope that that improvement continues. I do not want there to be a step back.</p><p>An agreement seems to be emerging&#8212;I hope that it is&#8212;that there is too much testing in our schools. My daughter has just gone through testing as a seven-year-old. It was a frightening experience for her and her classmates. I watched as they worked themselves up to high doh about what was about to happen. They were told that the tests were important and that it was essential that they did well. Weeks were spent in the classroom preparing them for the tests and they were given what I can only call past papers to do at home. Those seven-year-olds were extremely worried about the test. It seemed to me that the worry <place-holder colnum=\"24636\"/> factor was what they got from the experience&#8212;they gained nothing of relevance to their education. Teachers in our schools should be given the freedom to teach, to use their judgment and to alert parents when there is a problem. We should deal with the matter in that way rather than through fixed testing.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13359386", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Sylvia Jackson, I should start with a declaration of interest, not as a former teacher but as an ex-pupil and, perhaps more relevantly, as the father of an eight-year-old who is currently going through the system.

I am not quite sure what Euan Robson was trying to say, but I do not think that the full capacity of the Golden Jubilee is being used. It is dealing with more than its original allocated number of procedures, but capacity is far from being used.</p><p>Helen Eadie, who has unfortunately left the chamber, talked about huge increases in activity. That is rather odd, given that the total number of people waiting for inpatient and day-case treatment has changed little in the past two years. I mentioned that earlier in an intervention. Eleanor Scott also mentioned it, as did Audit Scotland's report. Helen Eadie said that extra people were waiting because many new treatments had come on board&#8212;the example that she used was hip replacements. I have to point out to Helen Eadie that hip replacements have been around a lot longer than two years and that, therefore, that was rather a strange example to use.</p><p>The reason for raising that point is that, although we welcome the extra investment to deliver lower figures, it has not reduced the overall number of people who are waiting. That must be a concern for the Government as well as for others. If we are not reducing the overall number of people who are waiting, we cannot continue to pump in more and more resources. As we know, all resources are finite. Stewart Stevenson's analogy about making a huge effort to move a short distance forward only to fall back again was good.</p><p>Alex Johnstone's speech was interesting but I am not sure what planet he is on. I do not know in which country the left-wing has had supremacy in terms of health care ideology since 1997, which Alex Johnstone suggested is the case, but I do not think that it was this country. I am sure that Tony Blair might find that rather offensive to himself and his politics.</p><p>Jamie Stone, who is also not here, unfortunately, made an interesting point. He said that, although it is important to improve treatment, it is more important to improve health. That is a fundamental point to keep in mind in all of our health debates. The idea of health inequalities is critical. Although the healthy life expectancy in many of our communities is good, in many other <place-holder colnum=\"23557\"/> parts of our country, it is low&#8212;indeed, in some places, it is among the lowest in Europe. That is an extremely important point, although I do not think that the Liberal Democrats thought of it first. I know that Liberal Democrats like to claim the credit for everything, but many of us have been keen to talk about health inequalities, improving health in general and the importance of public health in the area of health improvement.</p><p>Duncan McNeil has been barracking from the back of the chamber, as usual. During his speech&#8212;when he was supposed to speak&#8212;he made a rather bizarre point when he implied that the SNP is not interested in health because our benches were empty. His point would have been better made had there been anyone sitting on the Labour benches around him, but unfortunately the only thing near him was the tumbleweed rushing through the empty seats around him.</p><p>Duncan McNeil made a rather more interesting point on cancer care, which Nanette Milne also mentioned, when he gave figures for breast cancer and colorectal cancer waiting times in Inverclyde. We congratulate the staff in that area on their excellent work in ensuring that waiting times are so low&#8212;that is fantastic. Unfortunately the figures for colorectal cancer waiting times throughout the country are nowhere near as good as the figures to which Duncan McNeil referred.

As the committee recommends, I would like the bill to be amended so that local authorities will have to advise marchers of their decision on proposed events seven days in advance.

Unfortunately, I do not think that they will cut knife crime, which is the intention. We all know about the volume of knife crime and the ever-younger age at which people carry knives. However, throughout Scotland in 2003, only two charges were brought of selling knives to persons under the age of 16. I welcome and support the move to raise the legal age for purchasing knives from 16 to 18 but, unfortunately, the measure will have no impact if we do not enforce the law.</p><p>I also welcome the move to double the maximum sentence for possession of a knife. However, although the Executive's announcement and accompanying press release proclaimed that the maximum sentence for possession of a knife is to be doubled, the Executive unfortunately omitted the fact that it is to be doubled only for people who are convicted on indictment. In 2003, around 2,800 people were convicted for possession of a knife, but only 42 people&#8212;less than 2 per cent&#8212;were convicted on indictment. Of those 42, only 32 received a custodial sentence, of whom only two received the maximum sentence.

Therefore, I intend to lodge amendments at stage 2 that would have that impact.</p><p>The bill will amend section 49(1)(b) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 to double the maximum sentence on indictment for possessing a knife, but if we were to amend section 49(1)(a) of that act, we would double the sentence in summary cases. We do not have to wait for another bill to be able to do that; we could do it now. As it stands, the bill will impact on 2 per cent of those who are convicted, but my proposed amendment would impact on 98 per cent. Together, those provisions would catch 100 per cent with no delay.</p><p>For some time, I have been raising in the committee and in the Parliament the need for hospitals to report non-accidental offensive weapons injuries to the police. It is time that we introduced a system of mandatory reporting, as it is clear that official figures on knife attacks underestimate the size of the problem by anything from a half to three quarters. Providing the police with the information that they require to be able to crack down on knife crime would have an immediate impact. The police would know what weapons were being used, where and at what time incidents were occurring and what age groups were involved, which would allow them to focus their resources extremely effectively.</p><p>We do not have to wait for any further pilot studies&#8212;although I welcome the one that has just <place-holder colnum=\"23050\"/> started in Glasgow&#8212;because one has been carried out in Cardiff, which resulted in a 24 per cent drop in the number of hospital admissions. Mandatory reporting works and we should implement it in Scotland as soon as possible. I was pleased to hear the minister's statement on that issue, and I look forward to the committee receiving more information before stage 2.</p><p>The power to take fingerprints using hand-held devices raises civil liberties issues and although I support any reasonable measures to combat crime, I have some concerns about that power.</p><p>The bill states that fingerprints</p><p class=\"indent\">\"shall be destroyed as soon as possible\",</p><p>but that is rather open ended, and I would be happier if the bill placed a time limit on their retention. The Executive's response to the committee on that point was that fingerprints will be deleted straight away. Therefore, I assume that the Executive will consider supporting an amendment that places a maximum time limit on the retention of fingerprints, and I would appreciate hearing the Executive's view on that in the deputy minister's closing speech.</p><p>The second concern about fingerprints arises when a person refuses to be fingerprinted because they have done nothing wrong and it later transpires that the police officer's reasonable suspicion was misplaced and that the person was entirely innocent. Because the person refused to be fingerprinted in the first place, they would have committed an offence. It does not seem reasonable that an innocent member of the public should commit an offence by asserting the fact that they are innocent, so I ask the Executive to reconsider whether that should be an offence in the circumstances that I have described. I also ask the Executive whether it would support an amendment to rectify the matter.</p><p>There is insufficient time to cover all aspects of the bill, but the Scottish National Party will support the motion at decision time.

As John said, 52 people died last year while they were waiting for transplant organs.</p><p>Recent estimates show that, if presumed consent were to be included in the bill, approximately 29 extra donations would be made. That figure does not mean that 29 people would be saved, but that 29 people would get a heart transplant, 29 more would get a liver transplant and another 58 would get kidney transplants. In total, 116 people would be saved if presumed consent were introduced. In addition to the 116 people who would be saved, another 58 people would be lifted out of blindness. We are talking not only about saving lives; many people need cornea transplants that will give them sight again.</p><p>The debate on John Farquhar Munro's amendments is extremely important. As he said, although 90 per cent of people in this country support organ transplantation, very few carry a card. I carry a card and I know that many other members of the Scottish Parliament also do, but many people do not.</p><p>Importantly, the debate is not about the removal of anyone's rights. If we were to have a system of presumed consent, a person would have the absolute right to say that they do not wish their body to be used after their death&#8212;that right is absolute; it cannot be taken away. Instead, we are talking about granting rights to people who are waiting desperately on transplant lists.</p><p>To this day I have never understood why other people should get the final say about what happens to me on my death. If I die and my expressed wish is that my body be used for transplant, why can others override my wish? I do not think that other people&#8212;whether my wife, mother, father, daughter or my nearest and dearest friends&#8212;should have the final say about what happens to me; I should have the final say. At the point of my death I want my body to be used, if it is at all possible, to help others. That is the right thing to do. By introducing presumed consent we could achieve that; we could give life to many people.</p><p>I urge members to look not to their party whips&#8212;I hope that they have not been whipped on this issue&#8212;but to their consciences, and to consider whether to introduce presumed consent would be the right thing to do for our fellow Scots.

As many members know, the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area ranges from dense urban areas such as Dumbarton, Paisley and Greenock, to remote, rural areas, including a <place-holder colnum=\"21657\"/> clutch of west coast islands. The area covers nearly 3,000 square miles of territory and both sides of the Clyde, with a population of approximately 420,000. Unfortunately, almost 50 per cent of that population is in deprivation quintiles 4 and 5, which is nearly 10 per cent higher than the Scottish average. That clearly had something to do with the problems.</p><p>On many occasions, the Executive has claimed that geography was the problem. However, the geography has not changed. The Clyde did not suddenly appear last year, the islands did not suddenly pop out of the sea six months ago and Paisley did not suddenly appear last Tuesday. The geography has always been there. The core problem was the failure to plan to deal with geography. In May, the minister said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is apparent that the geography of the NHS Argyll and Clyde area is simply not a natural area for a single health board.\"</p><p>Duncan McNeil said earlier in the debate&#8212;and I hope that I quote him correctly&#8212;that \"it never made sense\". If it was so obvious that Argyll and Clyde NHS Board should not exist, who was daft enough to create it in the first place? Perhaps it was those evil Tories, back in the dark days. Funnily enough, it was not the Tories&#8212;the Labour party set up Argyll and Clyde NHS Board in 1999. The Labour party set it up, failed to invest in it and failed to see the geography that is now apparently so obvious to us all. It could never exist and should never have existed as a single health board. As I said, the geography has not changed, so the structural funding problem remains. The minister has not addressed the structural deficit and has failed to guarantee funding that will deal with the issue. He has said that he has an open mind on transitional funding. I hope that in his closing remarks he will say how the structural deficit will be dealt with if there is not to be at least transitional funding over the next while.</p><p>Why choose option 1 if all patients from north of the river go to Glasgow? That makes little sense, and I know that Jackie Baillie perhaps shares that view. Her point about patients being forced to go to Paisley is correct. Therefore, can we have faith that there will not be similar pressures under the new structures? The Executive's decision to abolish Argyll and Clyde NHS Board was nothing more than a panic measure. Others have called it crisis management. I agree that it had to go, but unfortunately, the change should have happened on the basis of forward planning and strategic thinking, not crisis management. It was made in isolation; it was not part of a wider plan for health boards. There was no advanced research on its likely impact on patients, staff or adjoining health boards.

Let us get some detail so that we can consider the matter properly.</p><p>The consultation did not deal with the impact on the future plans of the surrounding health boards, which is obviously extremely important. The consultation was just about boundaries.</p><p>One of the respondents to the consultation summed the position up quite well. Dr Bell said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"by limiting the scope of the consultation to where the new boundaries should be drawn, a real opportunity to try ... new ways of providing Health and Social Care, which, with imagination and political courage, could have been discussed, has been excluded from comment\".</p><p>The consultation was very narrow.</p><p>It is clear that the consultation was completely inadequate. It did not ask people what they really wanted; instead, it provided only three possible options on boundaries from which people could select. I say to the minister that no analysis of those responses has been made available on the Executive's website. Why has analysis of the responses not been provided? Perhaps they were too embarrassing.</p><p>There were around 400 responses from individuals. In the time that was available to me, I managed to sample 250 of them. Option 1 received 45 positive responses; option 2 received 57 positive responses; option 3 received 25 positive responses; and the none of the above option received 123 positive responses. In the sample that I considered, 50 per cent of the people who responded could not express a preference. Many of them expressed <place-holder colnum=\"21659\"/> dissatisfaction with the consultation process and because all the options from which they had to choose were unsatisfactory.</p><p>I will quote various people who submitted responses. One said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Having studied the consultation paper and having attended several meetings ... I still feel that we have not been given sufficient information on which to base a positive decision\".</p><p>Another person said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Having considered the evidence I would support the formation of an Argyll and Bute Health Board\".</p><p>Many people said that, although it was dismissed as a possible option. Another person said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I do not accept the broad brush reasons given for rejecting options 10.3 and 10.4\".</p><p>Even the 50 per cent of people who expressed a preference were unhappy with the consultation process. People who expressed a preference often did so grudgingly and with deep reservations. For example, one person said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Option 1 seems the best of a bad bunch\".</p><p>Somebody else said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If I had to pick any of the options it would be no 3 though this is far from satisfactory\".</p><p>Somebody else said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"option 1 is the best of a bad lot\".</p><p>The consultation failed. Many people expressed a negative preference during the consultation process and said that they could not choose between options 2 and 3, but that they definitely did not want option 1. How can the minister make decisions on the basis of such a consultation? Why was there no proper analysis that gave details of the responses on the Executive's website?</p><p>We all hope that the new set-up will work because people in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area deserve a first-class, locally accessible service, but the consultation exercise was not carried out properly and the minister must still explain how he will deal with the underlying problems in the area.</p>", "hdate": "2005-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13351852", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Services (Argyll and Clyde)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Some commitments have been made on service delivery.

I realise that the minister talked about the authority at the beginning of the debate.</p><p>It is an extremely important achievement to get the bill through Parliament. I believe that it will be welcomed throughout Scotland and I shall be pleased to see it passed tonight. It is also important that we are tightening up the procedures relating to the release of certain sexual offenders. Again, that is most welcome, although it is a matter that has not received much attention in this debate.</p><p>On community justice authorities, it makes perfectly good sense that organisations that are connected with rehabilitation of prisoners should work together. That will help to ensure that people who have just been released from prison are given the opportunity to break free from the downward spiral that all too often ends with them back in prison. Jeremy Purvis cited statistics relating to that. To achieve what is envisaged, structures need to be in place to ensure that, on release, prisoners have a place to stay, assistance in staying clear of drugs and drink, and help in obtaining work or training in order to give them stability and some hope for the future.</p><p>Despite the best efforts of many organisations, too many prisoners have slipped through the net of the existing system. If we are really serious about tackling the horrific reoffending rate in Scotland, a joined-up approach is crucial, and that is where CJAs will have an important role to play. However, as many members have said, structures alone do not improve situations; however, adequate resources and what is done with them can and will assist in determining the outcomes when combined with those new structures. The Executive must ensure that whatever resources are necessary are allocated to those front-line services to accommodate the extra responsibilities that will arise from that change.</p><p>The ADSW argued that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the important issues were the provision of services to deal with the underlying problems of alcohol, drugs, housing and the other problems that existed before an individual entered prison.\"<place-holder colnum=\"20402\"/></p><p>I certainly agree with that statement, but if CJAs work correctly they will facilitate co-ordination of those services to the benefit of the individuals who most require them.</p><p>However, I also believe that it would have been helpful to the committee to have had the minister's response to the consultation exercise on the proposed CJAs somewhat earlier than yesterday. I received a copy yesterday morning from the clerks, but it would have been better if that information had been available to the Justice 2 Committee early enough for members to examine and report on the minister's response. As it was, we were unaware of some of the detail of the CJAs when the bill was going through stages 1 and 2.</p><p>The committee came to the conclusion&#8212;although not unanimously, as we have seen this afternoon&#8212;that there was merit in home detention curfews for certain low-risk offenders, as Bill Butler pointed out. However, the effectiveness of those curfews will be limited by the amount of support that is available. It is crucial to the success of HDCs that, when additional support services are required, they are included as additional mandatory conditions&#8212;a point that I made to the minister earlier&#8212;over and above the standard conditions, in addition to their being available as voluntary options where appropriate. The minister responded to my earlier intervention by saying that it is not a case of applying blanket conditions for everybody, but additional mandatory conditions would not be blanket conditions; they would be applied to individual cases and assessed on their merits. However, where additional conditions are necessary, appropriate and helpful, we think that they should be mandatory. That was discussed widely in the committee. It is vital that such additional conditions be properly resourced and in place before HDCs begin.</p><p>HDCs will be suitable only for a limited number of prisoners and some categories may benefit more than others. There are far too many women in prison, and the majority of them are inside for non-violent offences. An HDC would allow a prisoner who is the mother of small children the opportunity to rebuild her relationship with her family and to contribute to the well-being of her children in a way that would be impossible if she were still in prison. Surely that is to the benefit of our whole society. Many women prisoners have drug and other problems that HDCs, combined with appropriate conditions and their being properly resourced, could greatly assist with.</p><p>Overall, I can see benefits from the use of home detention curfews. Any problems that arise from them will be surmountable. However, neither HDCs nor the community justice authorities on their own will be enough to overcome the <place-holder colnum=\"20403\"/> problems that prisoners face. The committee took the view that the inclusion of additional mandatory conditions would assist in allowing HDCs to succeed: we want to see HDCs in place, but we want to ensure that they succeed, which was why we took that view. Although I support the bill, which has a lot of good stuff in it, I confess to being a bit concerned that the minister, in evidence to the committee and again this afternoon, has refused to commit to additional mandatory conditions for HDCs when they are necessary.

It is cheap to prevent such fractures and expensive to treat them, but the minister does not know whether they are being prevented because he does not monitor the situation or track progress.

A pertinent example of that problem is the incidence throughout Scotland of coronary heart disease, which is far more common in our deprived communities than in our affluent communities. As the British Heart Foundation has pointed out, last year nearly double the number of people with CHD were discharged from hospital in Glasgow Shettleston as in Edinburgh West. That is why it is so critical that we should follow the Kerr recommendation on that.</p><p>An example of a project that was designed to do just that was the have a heart Paisley project that was set up in October 2000</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to reduce the total burden and levels of inequality of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in the town of Paisley\".</p><p>Eight of Paisley's 11 postcodes have higher deprivation levels than the Scottish average.

What confidence can we have that the Executive will follow through on that recommendation? The recommendation requires national policy to direct and co-ordinate local action.

To judge by past examples, the answer to that question would be no. Technology in itself will not save us; we must have the foresight to apply it appropriately. NHS 24 was set up to take calls, not make them. However, when the new GP contract came into effect, the remit of NHS 24 was changed to take on the business of providing a first point of contact and triage services for out-of-hours patients, but no one rethought the technology. It is not possible to make calls automatically from NHS 24. The review of NHS 24 states that an enormous amount of nurses' time is being taken up by making calls out of NHS 24. The technology is available to sort the problem, but no one has thought it through.</p><p>The Kerr report is all about working smarter, looking ahead and planning to prevent crisis. However, the Executive has declared that it has no intention of producing a national strategy and that it will not monitor supplementations, and it is also looking to the private sector, despite the evidence from England of its negative impact on the NHS. It is failing to implement national policy, but instead hopes that local fixes will do, and it has changed the remit of organisations without changing the tools that they require to carry out their new roles. When I look at that, it seems to me that we do not have a Government that has the necessary foresight or will to implement successfully the Kerr report recommendations. On the evidence so far, this Government is neither capable of nor fit to achieve that goal, which is necessary for all of us in this country.</p>", "hdate": "2005-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13347578", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is not about counting tablets.

That point was made by almost every member&#8212;Bill Butler made it right at the start of the debate and the minister, Kenny MacAskill, Jeremy <place-holder colnum=\"19633\"/> Purvis and various others all followed suit. It is extremely important that we do not demonise our young people. There are problems in some sections of our society, but they represent a tiny minority.

She is absolutely right when she talks about early intervention. My only point of disagreement arose when she talked about early intervention from birth; I agree that there should be more midwives and more nursery teachers, but I think that it should be early intervention before birth. There are issues such as smoking, alcohol consumption during pregnancy, whether we should add folic acid to food products such as flour and mothers' other dietary and nutritional needs. A range of issues need to be discussed, apart from deprivation among mothers-to-be, all of which have an impact on a child even before it is born.</p><p>The issue of coterminosity was raised by a number of members. I agree and disagree with Maureen Macmillan's comments about coterminosity. Lack of coterminosity can be overcome, as in the example that she gave in Moray.

The reality appears to be that young offenders are still viewed as the responsibility of social work departments, despite the essential role of other departments in meeting their needs. When the committee went round and examined various other departments, it found a lack of involvement in the process. Certain members highlighted education departments' responsibility in that area. Many individuals&#8212;it may be an individual rather than a systemic problem&#8212;believed that it was their job to turn up because they had a place on the committee, but that that was the extent of their responsibility, and that it was down to social workers to deal with the <place-holder colnum=\"19634\"/> problem of young offenders.

It has a vital role to play, which we undermine at our peril.

The committee had profound concerns about short-term funding and the problems of funding that many agencies experienced. In about 1990&#8212;15 years ago&#8212;I worked in an area of long-term unemployment, in a project dealing with literacy and numeracy problems in adults. Much of the effort of such projects went into ensuring that they could get the funding for the next phase rather than into dealing with those problems. That issue is not new&#8212;it has been around for so many years that we should have tackled it by now; I hope that we will do so in the near future.</p><p>Many of the problems that we face are related to alcohol. I agree with some of Jeremy Purvis's comments about alcohol problems. However, I hope that I am incorrect in thinking that he said that every youngster who is caught with alcohol should be referred to alcohol counsellors. I do not believe that that would be appropriate. It is a perverse idea that every youngster who happens to be at a party with their pals or who happens to be under the age of 18 and has a glass of wine or a can of beer should be referred to alcohol counselling. That is a rather skewed and bizarre view of how we should educate our children about alcohol use. If that is what Jeremy Purvis intended to say, I cannot agree with him. We have to deal with the core, underlying problems, not just with the symptoms. We have to deal with alcohol abuse, drug abuse and deprivation, and with a society that believes that consumerism is the ideal way forward. The consumerist ideal says, \"Get it all. Get it now\", but many young people feel left out of that, which unfortunately leads to problems.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13346424", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Absolutely.

Judges will have to take into account the rights of all those involved, both the victims and the accused. They will also have to take heed of the ECHR. However, that does not mean that they should give bail almost automatically; there needs to be a more robust interpretation of the ECHR. It is not the case that all over Europe everyone is getting bail. In many other countries, the use of the ECHR has not fundamentally changed the number of people who receive bail or who are remanded.</p><p>It was good to hear in the First Minister's statement about the priority that is being given to tackling the scourge of drugs in our communities. However, his upbeat message of success does not equate with the reality of life in those areas that suffer under the scourge of drugs. Only this morning it was reported that the price of cocaine on the streets of Scotland has fallen by 20 per cent since last year. The only reasons for a drop in price are that the supply has increased or that there is more competition in the marketplace&#8212;in other words, there are more drugs on the streets and more dealers.</p><p>The Executive is simply not doing enough to tackle the problem. Drugs destroy lives and blight communities. They place an extra strain and burden on the health service and on local government departments such as social work and they are responsible for a large percentage of the crime that is committed. The crimes that are committed range from petty theft or shoplifting in order to raise funds to pay for the drugs right up to neglect of their children by some addicts, and they include assault and murder by the dealers. We cannot allow that to continue because to do so would be to deny justice to those who are suffering under the drug culture. We need to invest in the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts to ensure that they get themselves drug free and remain so. As my colleague Kenny MacAskill said, we have to tackle the problems of drink, drugs and deprivation if we are truly to turn things round.</p><p>I welcome the announcement of the doubling of the maximum penalty for carrying a knife. I hope that the courts will take note of that and treat knife crime with the seriousness that it deserves and <place-holder colnum=\"18835\"/> demands. One just has to ask any doctor or nurse&#8212;particularly any who works in accident and emergency&#8212;about knife culture in Scotland and they will paint a vivid picture of the problem. However, much of the evidence is anecdotal, as knife wounds are not notifiable. Why is it that a knife wound is not a notifiable injury? When someone comes into A and E with a wound from a firearm, hospital staff are obliged to notify the proper authorities, but they are under no such obligation to report knife injuries in the same way. Surely we should reconsider that and look at making knife wounds notifiable. By doing so, we would start to gain a clearer understanding of the problem and we would help the police to do their job.</p><p>It is clear that Scotland has a problem with knife crime and it is only right and proper that we introduce laws to tackle it, even if they are different from what happens in the rest of the UK. That is why it is puzzling and downright illogical for the First Minister to argue that it is right to have different laws on knife crime on either side of the border but wrong to have different laws on firearms. The First Minister talks about the benefits of consistency in gun laws across borders but argues the opposite in relation to knives. He is right that the Scottish Parliament should do the best for Scotland when it comes to knives, but he is completely wrong to say that we must not take a different point of view from Westminster on firearms. What will he tell the people of Scotland if Westminster decides not to act or if it does not go far enough in tackling the problem? Is there a plan B? It does not sound as if there is one. It is clear that we need to act. No solution to the firearms issue in Scotland will come from begging, hoping and praying that Westminster will act for us. We should take the powers and we should take the action.</p><p>I am sure that many people will be waiting with interest to hear the detail of the Executive's plans for the children's hearings system. It sounds fine for the Executive to do such things as reducing paperwork, as the First Minister stated this morning.

Two years ago, I launched the proposal, which was that we would ban smoking in public places; that was my intention. With a few honourable exceptions throughout the parties, I was almost a lone voice on the subject at that time. Indeed, 18 months ago, the First Minister said that a smoking ban was both unworkable and impractical and the Liberal Democrat Deputy First Minister agreed.</p><p>What a tremendous turnaround there has been in the past 18 months. I am delighted that so many members and parties have changed their mind and stance and now support this extremely important and welcome health measure, which is of course SNP policy. The Lib Dems cannot rewrite history, as Nora Radcliffe tried to do and as Mike Rumbles has tried to do before. I have ignored it before, but today I will mention it. The Liberal Democrats were not the first party to support a public smoking ban; that is just not true. They can repeat the claim as often as they like, <place-holder colnum=\"18742\"/> but it is fundamentally wrong.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13344501", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start on a rather disappointing note in relation to the reinsertion of the cut-off date for claims to the Skipton Fund.

That is important and I hope that the minister, when he sums up, will set out what will happen in the run-up to the ban. It is clear that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We have often talked about people taking this opportunity to give up cigarettes in advance of the legislation coming into force. In Norway, there was a 3 per cent drop in smoking rates before the legislation came into force. What education programmes and advertising campaigns will there be? Can the Executive tell us about anything else that will happen in that extremely important period? I said 15 months, but that is incorrect&#8212;it is less than a year until the ban comes in. I would like to know exactly what we are going to do in the run-up. Let us ensure that we do not miss the opportunity.</p><p>When I was preparing for the debate, I decided to read about the history of smoking&#8212;not the current situation in Scotland and the figure of 13,000 deaths a year from smoking-related ill health that we all know about. One of the interesting facts that struck me was that ever since tobacco arrived in Europe, it has generated huge debate and controversy. Stewart Stevenson said that in the Crimean war many of our soldiers were introduced to cigarettes for the first time. Of course, the history of tobacco goes back a lot further than that of cigarettes. It is thought that tobacco plants first began to grow around 6,000 BC in the Americas. By the start of the Christian era, tobacco use was well established all over the Americas, but there is no record of tobacco being grown or used anywhere else in the world. When the American continent was first opened up, tobacco use spread out of it to Europe. However, the far east, for example, did not adopt the habit. China banned the planting and use of tobacco in 1612 and Japan followed suit in 1620&#8212;if only they had kept those bans in place.</p><p>Things were slightly different in Europe. In 1665, smoking was made compulsory for boys at Eton College&#8212;perhaps that explains the Tory view today. Right from its introduction into Europe, there were conflicting theories and views about tobacco. At the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, tobacco was attracting interest from many herbalists and was believed to be good for treating many illnesses from toothache to colic. Yet, as early as 1602, a book was published that claimed that illnesses in chimney sweeps were linked to their exposure to smoke and drew a parallel with <place-holder colnum=\"18743\"/> tobacco smoking. We all know, of course, that James VI wrote a marvellous treatise, \"A Counter-blaste to Tobacco\", in 1604. However, all those theories lacked proper scientific research to back them up and proper statistics from which conclusions could be drawn. Now, of course, statistics are carefully recorded and, if we turn to America, where smoking started, we can see what has happened in that continent in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>In 1914, there were only 371 cases of lung cancer in the whole of the United States of America. In 1919, a young medical student who went on to do important work on the link between smoking and cancer was told to attend an operation on lung cancer because it was so rare that that might be his only chance to see it in his career. However, by 2003, there were 172,000 cases of lung cancer in the USA. The number of cases rose from 371 in 1914, to 2,500 by 1930 and to more than 7,000 by 1940. What had changed? Smoking was being taken up by more and more Americans. Cigarette rations were given to soldiers during the first world war and smoking among men became prevalent. Women did not take up smoking until the end of the second world war and many women are today suffering from the effect of that cultural shift.</p><p>The 20<sup>th</sup> century was the century of the cigarette, but I hope that the 21<sup>st</sup> century is a century of no cigarettes and that we move away from tobacco, smoking and the disease and ill health that they bring.</p><p>Many people have been involved in the bill. I thank the campaigners outwith the Parliament, the staff of the non-Executive bills unit and the clerks of the Health Committee, the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Finance Committee, who worked extremely hard on the bill. I also thank the staff in my office, who worked extremely hard in the background to ensure the success of the campaign.</p><p>It is not often that one gets a chance to force a subject to the top of the political agenda and see it succeed and I feel extremely privileged to have done so. I have been asked many times why I took up this issue. My motivation is simple. I fought this campaign for the young people of Scotland, for the children who are not yet born and, in particular, for the future of Catherine, my daughter. She will grow up and go out to smoke-free restaurants and pubs and go to work in smoke-free places. For her sake and for the sake of all the children of Scotland, I take the greatest pleasure in supporting the bill this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13344501", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. The member had her chance.

I do not know where Phil Gallie is going with that argument.</p><p>The main reason for rejecting the amendments is that they are nothing more than subterfuge and an attempt to hide behind an argument about artistic integrity. The cry of artistic freedom from the Tories is a cover for punching holes right through the bill, when it is in fact a bill about protecting public health. To be polite, I think that it is unreasonable of the Tories to try to use artistic freedom in that way. Artistic freedom is not the issue and it is in no way damaged by the bill. There is no censorship of the arts, which can carry on as normal.</p><p>On the amendments seeking to exclude more premises than are currently listed in the bill, I point out that the bill excludes certain premises on humanitarian grounds. A tobacco shop is not a place of residence; it is not a care home and it is clear that nobody lives there. In the case of the illicit trade in expensive cigars&#8212;I am sure that Brian Monteith knows more about such cigars than I do&#8212;if the owner of a cigar shop needs to test a cigar, why would it be beyond their wit and wisdom to step outside to smoke that cigar and test whether it is real?

It has never been interested in artistic integrity and artistic freedom, or the rights of workers and of the vast majority of the population who believe that their health should be protected. This is about wrecking the bill and punching holes in it. The Tories failed to do that with my bill; they failed to do it at stage 2 of this bill because they had no support from any member of the Health Committee; and they will fail to do it today.

That is extremely important. As Jackie Baillie said, the current situation is partly reliant on the good will of those in charge of the various bodies throughout <place-holder colnum=\"18038\"/> the country. That is fine where we have willing, able and motivated individuals who go the extra mile to work together and to integrate services. However, where that is not the case, we are letting down individuals and the communities that they come from. That must change.</p><p>The creation of CJAs will mean that there are bodies that are directly responsible for ensuring that various groups work together, that a high standard of service is maintained and that all groups work together to cut reoffending. It is entirely logical that bodies that deal with offenders, such as the SPS, social work, housing, health, education, employment, family services and other support providers, should all be involved in working together to address offending behaviour. However, it seemed to me and to other committee members that the sharing of information among the various bodies was somewhat haphazard. Therefore, it is crucial that, as soon as the CJAs are set up, all participating bodies ensure that information is shared speedily and accurately across the board. Only then will CJAs have the ability to work effectively.</p><p>On balance, I support CJAs, but I have certain caveats. Margaret Mitchell's statement that the SNP unreservedly supports the proposals is not true; we have some issues with HDCs. For example, Stewart Stevenson said earlier that Jonathan Aitken was released on an HDC. That led me to change my mind on the matter; I cannot possibly support such a terrible measure. Seriously, though, unlike the Tories, I can see some merit in HDCs, but only if additional support services are either included as mandatory conditions or available as voluntary options.</p><p>There are three standard conditions of the curfew agreement that must be met: the curfew condition itself; the requirement to be of good behaviour; and the requirement not to commit an offence. There is no disagreement about the need for there to be standard conditions that apply to everyone who is released on an HDC. However, the committee felt that, if we really wanted to cut reoffending, there ought to be a package of additional support measures that address an offender's behaviour and which, like the standard conditions, are mandatory. Jeremy Purvis and Karen Whitefield both mentioned that point.</p><p>The committee heard that view expressed in evidence when, for example, Sue Brookes from Cornton Vale said that HDCs would be particularly useful for female offenders, to assist stability and allow better access to services in the community, particularly if conditions requiring access to particular services are attached. Those additional conditions would be tailored to suit the individual, as some people would clearly be helped by an additional drug rehabilitation course or a course to <place-holder colnum=\"18039\"/> help them to deal with their alcohol problems, while others might require help with literacy or perhaps even employment training.</p><p>In some cases, it might be felt that there is no need for additional conditions. If that is the case, that is fine. However, each case must be dealt with on its own merits. By making the supplementary conditions mandatory in those cases where that is appropriate, HDCs would be much more effective. There is evidence to support that.</p><p>Professor McManus of the Parole Board for Scotland said that the most successful schemes that he had seen were in the United States of America. He said that those schemes</p><p class=\"indent\">\"all started off by pretending that they could work by keeping the person in a house, but every single one of them had to give in and use some form of supervision to assist the person in addressing the issues that come up in the domestic situation and those that gave rise to offending in the first place.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Justice 2 Committee</em>, 3 May 2005; c 1551.]</p><p>When the minister gave evidence to the committee, she did not seem convinced about the need for additional mandatory conditions and said that it was up to individuals to take responsibility. I agree that people should take responsibility, but one of the problems with the group of people about whom we are talking is that they are the very people who do not take responsibility for their actions. That is why I believe that it is important that we include additional mandatory conditions where appropriate. Over and above the standard conditions and the use of additional mandatory conditions, support services should be available for those who are being released that they can choose to take up voluntarily.</p><p>It is rather unfortunate that the Conservatives have had a knee-jerk response to the idea of HDCs. If risk assessments are carried out, only low-risk prisoners are allowed onto the scheme and we ensure that, where it is deemed appropriate, additional mandatory conditions are added to the HDC to address an individual's offending behaviour, HDCs could be the best option for some prisoners. Further, if they help to cut reoffending, they will also be the best option for society and communities.</p><p>It is imperative that there is no public perception that HDCs are a get-out-of-jail-free card, which is how some Tory members have described them, and it is incumbent on the Executive to ensure that the use of HDCs is not seen as being a soft option. Certainly, they must not be used as a quick way of cutting prisoner numbers.</p><p>What has been said about the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority is most welcome, although I have some concerns. Mike Pringle said that he would look forward to the millions of <place-holder colnum=\"18040\"/> pounds that would come back to the public purse. I would welcome that if it happens but, frankly, some of the people about whom we are talking will not pay or cannot pay and the system might not be as successful as we hope that it might be. However, it is absolutely right that we establish the principle that the people who are responsible for offences should pay compensation if they are able to.</p><p>I also welcome the fact that the Executive intends to tighten up on sex offenders. That is an important part of the bill and I was glad to hear what the minister said on the subject in her opening remarks.</p><p>Before I conclude, I apologise on behalf of Stewart Stevenson, who missed some of the closing speeches as he was called away at short notice on urgent business.</p><p>I support the general principles of the bill and feel that, although punishment must always play a part in sentencing, society benefits much more by ensuring that those who commit crime are given the opportunity to see that there is another way. Only by giving them that opportunity can we hope to address the alarming recidivism rate among offenders in Scotland. We must also remember that HDCs are not a get-out-of-jail-free card and remain a part of the sentence. The sentence is not concluded when the offender is released on an HDC; they can be recalled immediately to prison if it is felt that that should happen.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13342590", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Management of Offenders etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, not just now.

Such comments serve only to fuel the fire. That remark was not helpful in the least; indeed, it was totally counterproductive.</p><p>Fiona Hyslop's speech was excellent. She rightly spoke about the rights of the child. \"Ready Steady Teenager!\" sounds a good idea.</p><p>I will take a couple of moments to talk about the preparation for the debate. As Susan Deacon and other members said, it is right that we should have the debate. However, it is also important, especially when we debate such a crucial issue, that members can be fully informed of the developments that are under way and the progress that has been made. As I said, such debates often produce more heat than light, so it is important that we should try to get more light than heat. That is why it is particularly disappointing that preparation for the debate has been hampered by the lack of published information on the progress that has been made.</p><p>When the debate was scheduled, I contacted the Scottish Parliament information centre to obtain any published information that I might have missed. SPICe told me that it could find no published information and suggested the Executive library as a source. I contacted the Executive library and was told, \"No, we don't have anything. Why don't you contact SPICe?\" That was not helpful. In the end, I was told by an individual in the Executive library that they had <place-holder colnum=\"17964\"/> tried to locate a contact in the Health Department who might be able to help but had been unable to do so. That was not particularly helpful, either.</p><p>Undeterred, I pressed on in my attempt to get information and background material, because it is important that we get the facts right. We received further information this afternoon, when we learned that nothing had been published but that two meetings had been held earlier this month with stakeholders. The person who told us that stated that, unfortunately, they were not allowed to say any more, as the minister was making an announcement in this debate. Again, that did not help us to be informed so that we could fully engage in the debate with up-to-date information on what is going on.</p><p>Section 2 of \"Respect and Responsibility\" mentions the need to ensure that people with mental health problems are not excluded from appropriate sexual health services and it gives a commitment that the national sexual health advisory committee will carry out a diversity impact assessment to ensure that that matter is taken into account. However, nowhere in the report does that translate into a commitment to take practical action to provide services for people with mental health issues, even although those people can be extremely vulnerable. Margaret Smith mentioned people with disabilities, particularly learning disabilities, but that issue has not received the attention that it deserves. Those people are often very vulnerable. I hope that the minister will comment on people with mental health problems, particularly young people, because they are extremely vulnerable.</p><p>Section 3 of the action plan is on preventing sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies. Point 9.4 of the recommended actions states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Where contraception is available free of charge for women, condoms should also be freely available to both men and women. The Scottish Executive should explore the feasibility of resourcing NHS Boards to achieve this.\"</p><p>However, the Executive's response has been to push the issue off to the national sexual health advisory committee to explore the implications. I would have thought that the implications were fairly clear&#8212;the free availability of condoms would lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer STIs. If we intend to reduce the appallingly high rates of teenage pregnancies and STIs, I can think of no more obvious action than providing free condoms, which simultaneously protect against pregnancy and disease.</p><p>One issue that has been discussed before, although not particularly today, is the morning-after pill. The strategy states:<place-holder colnum=\"17965\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"emergency hormonal contraception ... should not be made available in schools.\"</p><p>I understand the sensitivity of the issue, which I know some people find awkward. It could be argued that in-school facilities in urban areas may not be as necessary, because girls could access services near at hand anyway. However, Shona Robison and Mike Rumbles touched on equality of access to services throughout the country. Will the minister say how girls in rural areas can access services? Let us take the example of a girl who lives in a farmhouse in a remote rural glen and is bussed to and from school every day. She has unprotected sex one day with a boyfriend, but how can she access services and the morning-after pill? She cannot wait for the weekend to get the bus to Inverness; she needs immediate action to deal with the mistake, if we can call it such. It is important that the Executive re-examines that issue. It may not be right to have in-school facilities in all schools, but in some cases the school might be the best place to provide the service. School nurses, who were mentioned by a number of members, could help in that area.</p><p>I ask members to support the amendment in the name of Shona Robison.

The Tories' plans would give to the few who can afford to pay at the expense of the many who cannot.</p><p>One of the most important issues that the report identifies is the potential for improvement that can be achieved through the separation of elective and non-elective work. The patient journey can often be haphazard, as I found out last year when I was required to go into hospital for an operation. I was relieved to have my operation, and I praise all the staff who were involved, particularly those in ward 5 of the Victoria infirmary in Glasgow, who were part of a highly professional and dedicated team. I appreciate the care that I received. However, when I was first diagnosed, I was told that I would have to wait between two and six months for an operation. After two months, I was informed that the operation would be at least another six months away. However, after two months and one week, I received a phone call during which I was asked whether I could take a cancellation a few days later. I was extremely grateful for that cancellation but, as my personal experience shows, it is crucial to separate out elective procedures to ensure that, as Professor Kerr says,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"if we make a commitment to see or treat a patient on a specific date, we must honour this, and ensure the quality of care delivered.\"</p><p>Professor Kerr suggests that to do that, NHS boards will have to fulfil several tasks. Those include ensuring that diagnostics and theatre facilities are actively utilised during a more flexible working day to allow more patients to be treated. That is an excellent idea and it is long overdue. Boards should also introduce pre-admission clinics <place-holder colnum=\"17742\"/> led by nurses and allied health professionals so that certain tests can be carried out prior to elective surgery. Such clinics would also manage variations in the length of patients' stay through admission on the day of surgery and active discharge planning. Along with the other recommendations, that would contribute greatly to the smoother running of elective procedures.</p><p>We in the Scottish National Party are very pleased that Professor Kerr agrees with our policy of introducing a network of diagnostic and treatment centres. I agree with David McLetchie that there is ample evidence from England that diagnostic and treatment centres have a vital role in bringing down the length of waiting times for treatment. In England, the statistics show that, between 2002 and 2004, the percentage of in-patients admitted within six months rose from 77 per cent to 91 per cent. However, that was not because of the private sector diagnostic and treatment centres. As of March 2004, there were only two private treatment centres in use in England. Most of the increase in the percentage of patients being treated and the cuts in waiting times were down to the use of centres within the NHS.</p><p>I agree with the Kerr report when it states that we should look to the NHS first. I also agree with the report when it goes on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If this action does not sufficiently meet the supply side pressures, NHSScotland should continue to explore options for targeted partnerships with private sector providers\".</p><p>However, the Executive decided to go straight to the private sector rather than use the NHS first. The NHS in England achieved great results through using diagnostic and treatment centres within the NHS, so is the minister able to explain why the NHS in Scotland could not do likewise?</p><p>I turn to the issue of staffing. If there is an expansion of the private health sector in Scotland, the big unanswered question&#8212;the Tories have never come up with a proper answer to it&#8212;is: where will the staff come from? I do not usually agree with Robin Cook, but I did when he recently said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"As a former health spokesman, I find the least appetising passage in the manifesto to be its curious belief that the capacity of the NHS can be expanded by increased use of the private sector&#8212;or, as it is delicately described in the text, 'the independent sector'. The reality is that the private sector does not add capacity to the NHS but competes with it for the time of its consultants. My local health board gave the game away recently by advertising a new post for a consultant to work three days a week in the NHS and two days a week in a private hospital at NHS expense. The danger with increasing private provision is that its commercial culture undermines the very public-service ethos that makes the NHS popular.\"</p><p>Does the Minister for Health and Community Care agree with his Labour Party colleague, Robin Cook? I do not think so, because, frankly, the <place-holder colnum=\"17743\"/> minister's assurances that private health companies involved in NHS work would be prevented from poaching NHS staff are not worth the paper they are written on. The self-same assurances were given in England and they have proved to be absolutely worthless. As Unison pointed out,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The treatment centres will be allowed to employ seconded NHS staff, contrary to the earlier assurances by the government that 'the medical staff from these units will be from overseas and additional to the existing NHS workforce.' Now, according to the BMA, overseas companies would be allowed to second up to 70% of their staff from the NHS.\"</p><p>The minister briefly mentioned health inequalities, and I have one comment to make on that. Health inequalities in Scotland are appalling, and they are getting worse, not better. Successive Tory and Labour Governments have made the difference between the life expectancy and healthy life expectancy of the richest and poorest in our society worse rather than better.</p><p>I welcome the Kerr report and its support for the many policies that the SNP has been advocating for some time, particularly the use of diagnostic and treatment centres primarily within the NHS to avoid the many pitfalls that would result from attempting to go down the Tory route of expanding the private health sector at the expense of the NHS.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-2931.1, to leave out from \"believes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"commends the staff within the NHS for their hard work and dedication; believes that, to tackle waiting times more quickly, there is a need to set up fast-track diagnostic and treatment centres within the NHS, and welcomes the Kerr report's emphasis on addressing health inequalities in order to close the health gap that currently exists in Scotland.\"</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13341856", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Not at the moment.

That is particularly true when someone enters premises such as a bank, as their appearance can cause alarm even if that is unintended. I used to ride a motorbike, and I found it a nuisance that I had to remove my crash helmet before I popped into my local bank. On colder days, I also had to remove a garment that resembled a ski mask, which I wore below my crash helmet to keep warm. Only once did I forget to take those off before entering my bank, but the look on the face of the nearest teller immediately reminded me that I had just walked into a bank wearing a leather jacket, gloves, a ski mask and a crash helmet. I was doing nothing wrong and I was not acting in a threatening manner, but because of the way in which I was dressed, people around me had a different perspective.<place-holder colnum=\"17490\"/></p><p>I use that example because, in debates such as this, we must remember that antisocial behaviour is sometimes in the eye of the beholder rather than based on the objective reality. There is no denying that there are people who behave in an appalling manner and cause untold misery to all around them. They should be dealt with, and I welcome the action and the initiatives that are being taken. However, there is a world of difference between behaviour that is criminal, such as vandalism, and groups of youngsters hanging around with their friends. I suspect that there are a few members who thought that they looked great when they met their pals on a Saturday night dressed as new romantics, punks, hippies, mods, rockers&#8212;or perhaps even teds, depending on their age. Groups of youngsters who are dressed in the fashion of the day have always seemed alarming to older generations: that is in the nature of the difference between the generations. When we are older, we forget what we were like when we were 15, and that allows us to find it intimidating to see groups of people who are dressed in what appears to be a peculiar manner hanging around together.</p><p>It may seem obvious to say that we should reward good behaviour rather than reinforce bad behaviour, but if the current rash of television programmes that deal with the disruptive behaviour of children are to be believed, many people have forgotten or have never learned that simple fact. If we ignore our children when they are good, they will never learn that their good behaviour is noticed and appreciated. It sometimes feels as though the Executive has forgotten that simple lesson in basic psychology. We should reinforce the behaviour that we want by paying it attention instead of reinforcing the behaviour that we want to discourage by focusing on it most of the time. If we do the latter, the result is a downward spiral of criticism, punishment and criminalisation when, in fact, we should separate out the good from the bad, then reward the good behaviour and punish the bad.</p><p>We seem to be concentrating on highlighting the bad behaviour while ignoring the vast majority who are well behaved. Diversionary schemes for those who have been involved in antisocial behaviour are welcome, but what about extra-curricular activities for those who behave themselves? We have all heard about schemes for kids who steal cars, which teach them about car mechanics and give them off-road driving lessons.

It is all very well to criminalise those who behave in a criminal manner, but perhaps we need to identify which youngsters are the real troublemakers and which are just hanging around on the periphery.</p><p>It seems to me that, in any setting, people in a group often fall into three basic categories: those who will cause trouble no matter what; those who will not cause any problems; and those who, falling somewhere in the middle, will lean towards one or the other mode of behaviour depending on the prevailing circumstances. The trick is to ensure that those in the middle lean towards not causing problems. If we can achieve that, the vast majority in any group will not cause a problem. I believe that, if we rewarded good behaviour so that young people got the chance to try out new things or to spend their time in positive extra-curricular activities, the group in the middle would lean towards that type of unproblematic behaviour. That would lessen the problems that many communities face and allow the police to concentrate on their prime activity of catching criminals and dealing with criminality.

Unfortunately, the recent \"Frontline Scotland\" programme showed that some elderly people in hospital are being denied basic care. We should point out that, in this context, basic does not mean minor; it means something that is fundamental or essential.</p><p>Various examples of a lack of respect and a disregard for human dignity have been highlighted. Teeth have not been cleaned; batteries have not been put in people's hearing aids, despite the fact that they have spares in their lockers; and because patients have not been taken to the toilet, they have wet and soiled themselves and have been left in that condition. Such situations are unacceptable and must change.</p><p>In recent years, emergency admissions to acute care have increased markedly, particularly in the oldest age groups. In 1981, the annual rate of over 85s who were admitted to hospital as acute care emergency admissions was 200 per 1,000 population. By 1999, that figure had grown to approximately 450 per 1,000 population, and it is continuing to grow.</p><p>The rising rate of hospital admissions for elderly people means that age discrimination in the NHS is becoming an increasingly urgent issue that will affect more and more people. However, although it is imperative that the care of the elderly in hospitals is improved, it is also imperative that, instead of simply concentrating on adding years to life, we put in place public health measures now to ensure that the old people of tomorrow have a longer healthy life expectancy.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that, according to the \"Healthy Life Expectancy in Scotland\" report for 2004, poorer people not only die younger than more affluent people but suffer more from ill-health and for longer periods. In 2000, healthy life <place-holder colnum=\"17268\"/> expectancy at birth for the least deprived women was 72.7 years but was only 61.6 years for the most deprived women. That is a difference of 11 years. For men, healthy life expectancy was 73.3 years for the least deprived and 55.9 years for the most deprived&#8212;a difference of 17.4 years.</p><p>Inequalities in healthy life expectancy are wider than inequalities in life expectancy. Males in the least deprived quintile have a healthy life expectancy at age 65 that is 50 per cent higher than that of males in the most deprived quintile. For those in deprivation category 1 who are aged 65, healthy life expectancy is 14.5 years; for those in deprivation category 5, it is only 9.7 years.</p><p>I turn now to nutrition for older people in hospital. On average, older people lose 5 per cent of their body weight during an acute stay. Nutrition is an important part of care in hospital, because malnutrition is linked to a poorer clinical outcome in surgical and medical hospital patients, has a high patient cost and is linked to significantly higher health care costs.</p><p>The report to the Executive on the implementation of clinical standards for food, fluid and nutritional care in hospitals recommended that ward staff should take responsibility for assessing the nutritional status of patients on admission and that patients who need assistance should be given the time and support that they need to eat their meals and snacks. I wonder whether the minister can tell us what action the Executive has taken on those recommendations. I am sure that we would all agree that older people in hospital should be able to take their meals and should not suffer the ill effects that come from malnutrition.</p><p>Many members have already spoken of their personal experience of elderly relatives in hospital. I, too, have unfortunately had that experience. My grandmother suffered a level of care that was far from perfect; she suffered many of the indignities that we have heard about in the media. We must do all that we can to ensure that everyone who needs hospital treatment is given the dignity and respect that they deserve. I urge all members to support the SNP motion today, to show that we care about the treatment of older people in the NHS.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340707", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service (Age Discrimination)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a sad day when, despite the hard work of many decent and caring staff in the service, we have to debate the indignity and lack of care that some older people have suffered and are still suffering in the NHS.

In its report for 2003-04, the SDEA said that since its launch its efforts had resulted in the arrest of 736 people, the seizure of more than 1,300kg of class A drugs and of more than 7,700kg of class B drugs and 333 disruptions to criminal networks. I am sure that we all welcome those achievements.</p><p>The SDEA's approach to serious and organised crime is increasingly founded on the implementation of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The seizure of &#163;5.4 million as outlined in the Executive's motion is welcome but, as I am sure that we all realise, that is only the tip of a very large iceberg. I wish Crown Office staff well in their attempts to seize the maximum amount from criminals that they can. However, I understand that the amount that can be retained in Scotland is still capped.

At that time, I was ridiculed by members in this chamber and, unfortunately, by members of the illustrious press corps. However, less than two years later, we have almost unanimous support for such a ban. I am glad that we have reached this point so soon. This is a great day for Scotland, as we take the first tangible step towards a smoke-free future and towards protecting the health not only of the current generation but of future generations.</p><p>I express my gratitude to all the people and organisations outside the chamber who have fought for smoke-free laws for a long time. I also express my gratitude to the Health Committee for its work not only on this bill, but on my bill.</p><p>However, I disagree fundamentally with the committee's comments in paragraph 38 of its report. As Irene Oldfather suggested, the idea that day care centres should be exempted from the ban makes no sense whatsoever. At the committee, the Minister for Health and Community Care argued correctly that allowing the exemption would lead to complex problems. It would also be a slippery slope. If day care centres are exempted on the ground that some people may spend some time during the day there, the way will be clear for all sorts of other places to be exempted on the same ground. A day care centre is not a temporary home; it cannot reasonably be argued that it is.</p><p>Turning to the debate over what has been called the level-playing-field approach and to the debate over enforcement, I believe that the two are inextricably bound together. Throughout the <place-holder colnum=\"16503\"/> debates, one of the big arguments in favour of a complete ban has been that it would create a level playing field. The committee took much evidence on that point and the Executive has used the level-playing-field argument to support its bill. The committee makes it clear that it agrees with that line of argument and it states expressly that any partial ban would not be as effective as a full ban. I agree with that absolutely. We need a comprehensive, clear and&#8212;most important of all&#8212;easily enforceable ban in order to protect people from the dangers of second-hand smoke.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Executive's bill does not achieve a level playing field because it contains a loophole that will allow smoking to continue in enclosed public places. Everyone is well aware of my unswerving support for a ban on smoking in enclosed public places. The minister is aware of my concerns on the definition that is contained in section 4(1); I wrote to him to point out the problem as I see it on the matter. The minister is also aware of my intention to lodge an amendment at stage 2 to close the loophole.</p><p>The bill, as it is drafted, fails to ban all smoking in enclosed public places. Although the bill bans the smoking of tobacco cigarettes, it continues to allow the smoking of non-tobacco cigarettes. The definition in my bill was not limited to the smoking of tobacco but covered all smoking. I urge the Executive to support the amendment that I will loge at stage 2.</p><p>I intervened on the minister to ask him whether he could tell me which of the two cigarettes that I held up for his inspection was covered by the bill and which was exempt. He could not give me an answer. I will hold them up again for members' inspection. It is clear to see that they look identical; it is impossible to tell which one will be exempt. If the minister could not differentiate between them&#8212;certainly, I cannot&#8212;how will enforcement officers, the police and other licence holders be able to tell the difference?</p><p>The point is important because, as the bill stands, the ban will not be as easily enforceable as it could be. The cigarette that I am holding up is a herbal cigarette&#8212;it contains a plant other than tobacco. A herbal cigarette produces tar and carbon monoxide just like a tobacco cigarette, yet it will remain perfectly legal to smoke this cigarette in an enclosed public place after the ban has been introduced.</p><p>The smoke from herbal cigarettes will affect non-smokers, particularly those with asthma and other chest problems or breathing difficulties, in exactly the same way that tobacco smoke does. The lack of voluminous research on non-tobacco cigarettes is sometimes used as an argument that those cigarettes may be less dangerous to health than tobacco cigarettes are. The argument is flawed, <place-holder colnum=\"16504\"/> however. Given that herbal cigarettes contain similar and sometimes higher levels of tar and carbon monoxide than tobacco cigarettes do, we can easily deduce that herbal cigarettes are at least as dangerous as tobacco cigarettes are and perhaps even more so.</p><p><em>The Lancet </em>published a study into the effects of smoking non-tobacco cigarettes, in which it said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our data showed that smoking these vegetable-based cigarettes led to a similar degree of exposure to carbon monoxide as smoking tobacco cigarettes, and may exceed the latter. Thus this product is a potential hazard to health.\"</p><p>Others agree. The British Lung Foundation stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A lot of people try herbal cigarettes because they think that since they don't contain nicotine they are safer.

As many others have said, 90 per cent of women admitted to Cornton Vale have addiction problems, 80 per cent have a history of mental health problems and more than 60 per cent have a record of being abused.</p><p>Half the women in Cornton Vale each year are on remand and yet the majority do not go on to receive a custodial sentence. Elaine Smith made that point earlier, which I thought was valid because the statistic is concerning. We have to ask ourselves why so many women are on remand in prison and yet do not receive custodial sentences. If the offences that they commit are so trivial that they do not merit a custodial sentence, why are they on remand in the first place? We need to get to the crux of that issue. In addition, most women in Cornton Vale are serving very short sentences and about half appear to have been sent there for fine defaulting.</p><p>Given that 80 per cent of the women there have a history of mental health problems, we have to ask ourselves why, for example, only 6 per cent completed a course on anxiety problems in 2003-04. There is a large gulf between the number of prisoners with problems and the number of prisoners who attend courses designed to help them overcome those problems.</p><p>Figures show that more than 90 per cent of women in Cornton Vale have addiction problems and yet in 2003-04 only 12.5 per cent of them completed a 21-hour drug awareness course and only 9 per cent completed a course entitled, \"Guide to Sensible Drinking\". Audit Scotland <place-holder colnum=\"15936\"/> reported that there are courses on drugs relapse prevention, alcohol awareness, advanced drug awareness and health choices. Not a single woman completed any of those courses at Cornton Vale in 2003-04. That makes me wonder whether they really are available to the prisoners, rather than just being available on paper. Were they just not available for the vast majority of women who registered an addiction problem but did not go on the courses that seemed designed for them? Why are the courses listed and yet no women are going on them, given that most of the women who enter the prison system register as having addiction problems? Was there a resource issue? That is why the amendment in the name of Stewart Stevenson is particularly appropriate, and I had hoped that the Executive would support it. It seems to me that the courses that we offer must be taken up by women in prisons if we are to begin to wean them off drugs and alcohol and address some of the anger management problems that they face.</p><p>Women are held not only in Cornton Vale; a number of women prisoners in the west of Scotland are held at the jail in Greenock. Last year, other members of the justice committees and I visited Greenock and spoke to many of the women who were held there at the time. Such women will be leaving Greenock soon. In August, they will be heading back to Cornton Vale, where work has been completed on its extension.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson raised the problem of holding women in prisons that are not specialist centres for women prisoners. Given that, one would have thought that women prisoners&#8212;whose number has averaged around 70 since the move to Greenock in November 2002&#8212;would welcome the move back to Cornton Vale, but it seems that they do not want to go back to Cornton Vale. From my personal experience of that visit, I know that many women prisoners have expressed a preference to stay in Greenock rather than return to Cornton Vale. A recent article in the local newspaper included a quote from a woman prisoner, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Greenock is much better than Cornton Vale. If you want something here, the staff try to help you.\"</p><p>Another woman prisoner said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I find here very good because staff will hear you out, even if nothing comes of it. Cornton Vale hands you a form for a complaint.\"</p><p>Those comments suggest that, although there can be no argument about whether Cornton Vale jail has improved, it still has problems.</p><p>Like the women in Cornton Vale, most of the women in Greenock prison are in custody for a variety of mostly low-level offences. They are much more likely than men to have been <place-holder colnum=\"15937\"/> imprisoned for low-level offences. In a recent interview, the governor of Greenock prison said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Female prisoners are different because they come into prison but still have to be the parent and family provider. When you come into prison as a single parent, your children go into care and you have to maintain a relationship with social workers and schools through the prison walls. ...When the women meet their kids and partners, it's very tearful and difficult. Kids are often reluctant to leave the room. Cornton Vale works on a different agenda. It would seem the staff relationship is better here.\"</p><p>In that interview, Governor McGill also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There's 66 females in right now and none of them poses a threat to the community; none that you could not put a tag on and let them out tomorrow.\"</p><p>If the women prisoners pose no threat to society, why are they in prison in the first place? The Executive has a responsibility to ensure that we imprison only those women who pose a threat to society, especially when imprisonment might involve taking away the only parent that a child has. Where women are imprisoned, the Executive must make available the necessary resources to ensure that proper treatment is available to enable them to avoid re-entering the prison system. That means that we must ensure that the courses that are listed are available to all prisoners, including female prisoners.</p><p>I urge the Executive to give serious consideration to alternatives to custody for many women offenders and to make available the necessary funding to ensure that those are put in place.</p>", "hdate": "2005-04-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13337430", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the fact that the Executive motion acknowledges the problem of the continuing growth in the female prison population in Scotland, which, over a number of years, has risen from 137 to 312, which the minister said was the figure last week.

We have had a series of very small debates that have covered a large number of topics that are of importance to the people of Scotland.</p><p>Some members have spoken about their aspirations for the health service in Scotland and the problems of public health in general. In particular, at the beginning of the debate, the minister highlighted the problems that are associated with alcohol and diet. I support many of the Executive's proposals and plans for introducing free fruit, trying to educate children in that area and improving the standard of school meals.</p><p>As far as public health is concerned, it will come as no surprise to anyone in the chamber that I believe that the proposal to ban smoking in public places will be seen in future years as a very <place-holder colnum=\"15890\"/> enlightened public health measure and that I fully support its implementation. I was glad to hear David Davidson's comment that he is an interventionist on health matters, and I look forward to his support for the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill when it comes before the Parliament. I can think of no greater piece of interventionist public health legislation that this Parliament could make.</p><p>However, if we are truly to tackle widespread health problems in our society, we must concentrate not only on fixing problems after they occur&#8212;as Jean Turner highlighted in relation to acute services&#8212;but on being more proactive in identifying any problems early on. Like David Davidson, I agree that it is essential to invest in screening programmes, because they will allow us to identify people who have a health problem but who have not yet developed any symptoms. Such investment will reap rewards not only for the individual, but for society in general. That said, if we really want screening to succeed, we must take it to the people; we must take it out of medical centres and into shopping centres. Part of the problem is that people will not go to their local general practitioner or medical centre for screening. However, if such screening were available in the local supermarket or shopping mall that they use regularly, they might think \"That's a good idea. I'll pop in and get my cholesterol or something else checked\". That is a very useful approach.</p><p>A common thread runs through areas such as poverty, pensions and the economy, which have all been mentioned today. Members can have as many aspirations as they like about eradicating the poverty or benefits trap, and I believe that they have a genuine desire to tackle pensioner poverty or to grow Scotland's economy, which the Executive has told us is its number 1 priority. However, benefits, taxation, pensions and macroeconomic policy, to name but a few matters, are all reserved to Westminster, which means that we can do nothing meaningful about them.</p><p>Even with health and the proposed smoking ban, we are operating with one hand tied behind our backs. For example, Ireland introduced a comprehensive workplace ban on smoking; however, although many of the groups that campaign on that issue want such a ban here, we are not allowed to do that, because health and safety is a reserved matter. It does not matter what the ambitions and aspirations of politicians and the Scottish people are, because, while Westminster holds the purse-strings, they are boxed in and limited. If Westminster decides to slash public spending in England and Wales, we will suffer. As things stand, there is nothing that we can do about it.<place-holder colnum=\"15891\"/></p><p>I am sure that there is no disagreement in the chamber with the idea that people should have aspirations for themselves. In fact, having such aspirations and taking responsibility for oneself would be universally applauded. The reaction would be the same if we talked about having aspirations for our families or taking responsibility for our businesses and aspiring to make them grow and be successful. Those aspirations would be warmly welcomed and people with such ambitions would be heartily congratulated.</p><p>However, when it comes to people who have real ambition and aspirations for Scotland, many members in the chamber, instead of congratulating us, tell us that we must not have ambitions for our country. Ambition is applauded by the Labour and Liberal parties when it is for an individual, a family or a business, but not when it is for our country. Labour members, Liberals and Tories abandon logic when we start to talk about the self-same aspirations for Scotland that we all support for individuals, families or businesses. When those of us who support Scotland have aspirations and ambitions, or even when we talk about taking responsibility for our country, we are not applauded by members of those other parties; instead, childish abuse is hurled in our direction. A certain Labour member of Parliament said that those Scots who support independence are nothing more than sewer rats. That comment says more about Labour MPs than it does about those at whom the comment was aimed.</p><p>If the argument of those who oppose independence was consistent, perhaps their position could be respected, but there is no logic to it. They tell us why nationalism is wrong, why it is an outdated idea and why it is a policy of the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, but apparently that argument applies only to Scotland and not to other countries around the world. Although they oppose the idea of the nation state for Scotland, they support it for everybody else. They argue fiercely for the continuation of the British nation state and for the creation of new nations around the world. The Tories loudly support the nationalists of countries such as Estonia. They applaud the get-up-and-go of the separatists of the Czech Republic.</p><p>The Labour Party has an enormous number of members who support the break-up of Britain, but only if it is Northern Ireland that leaves the UK to become part of a united Ireland. They have no problem with nationalism and they support it all over the world. They celebrated, as did we, when East Timor gained its independence from Indonesia, but they hurl abuse at those in Scotland who support independence for Scotland. They sing songs about those who struggle for independence and freedom across the globe and spit venom at those who support the self-same <place-holder colnum=\"15892\"/> thing here.</p><p>Let us not forget that every member of the Parliament is a nationalist. As far as I am aware, nobody supports the abolition of all nations and the creation of a single world Government. The debate about Scotland's future will not be limited by the barriers that the supporters of the British state try to place on it. The aspirations of the Scottish people can and will be met only when Scotland rejoins the world community as an equal partner and the Scottish Parliament has all the normal powers of a normal independent nation.</p><p>Members have talked about their aspirations and the aspirations of their constituents. Many of those aspirations are laudable aims, but they cannot be met by this Parliament because we do not have the powers to achieve them. Independence on its own will not achieve those aspirations, but without it we can do nothing to deal with them. We can only tinker at the edges. [<em>Interruption.</em>] I ask Labour members, how will they tackle economic policy? How will they deal with pensions? What will they do about the poverty of pensioners? They will do nothing, because they have no power to tackle those matters.</p><p>Only with independence will the resources of Scotland be used for the benefit of all the people who live here. At the same time, unlike past UK Governments, we will live up to our international obligations to assist other people around the world to achieve their ambitions and aspirations by meeting in full the United Nations target for international aid. An independent and free Scotland would join the family of nations around the world to work together for the aspirations of our people. Without that independence, we cannot fully manage and progress this country to where it should be or the place that it should take in the international community of nations.</p>", "hdate": "2005-04-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13337337", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Needs and Aspirations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has certainly been wide-ranging, although \"debate\" is perhaps not the right word.

The National Rifle Association and the pro-gun lunatics there have truly taken over the asylum. Fortunately for us, that is not the kind of culture that we have here in Scotland. Indeed, we do not have the gun problems that the south and <place-holder colnum=\"15696\"/> midlands of England have. However, we do have gun crime. In addition, we have an increasing problem with the use of replica weapons in crime and, tragically, we have witnessed the fact that air weapons are out there and can kill.</p><p>Replica weapons and air weapons can be bought with ease and their use is spreading. The question that we must answer is what we intend to do about the twin problems of replica weapons and air-guns, because having fewer guns means having less gun crime and I believe that that should be our goal. On replica weapons, we have to ask ourselves a number of questions. What is the purpose of owning such an item? What would it be used for? To what innocent purpose could a replica weapon be put? The answer to those questions is that replica weapons serve no purpose and are used more and more often in the committing of crime. Criminals choose them because they are easy to get and when they are pointed at people they have the same effect as real weapons. The problem is that it is impossible for people&#8212;even highly trained police officers&#8212;to determine whether a gun is real or a replica, except on close inspection. Even if there was an innocent use for replica guns, it makes more sense for our society to stop them being so freely available.</p><p>There are indeed legitimate reasons why certain people should have access to certain guns, and a number of speakers mentioned them. Such people include certain highly trained police officers in the course of their duties, farmers for the control of vermin, gamekeepers and stalkers for use in their employment and members of properly licensed clubs. Any guns that are used legitimately need to be tightly controlled, properly secured and used by people who are licensed by the police to do so.</p><p>However, there is no reason on earth why members of the public should have access to automatic weapons or handguns and I can see no reason for us to continue to allow unlicensed access to air weapons and replica weapons.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Firearms Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a particularly pertinent debate as it comes in the aftermath of the tragic death of Andrew Morton and in a week in which we have seen in the United States of America the harm that guns can do in a society.

Although other members have covered many of the points that I wish to cover, I do not think that it does any harm to cover them again, so I make no apology for doing so.</p><p>My understanding was that the bill was intended to deal with the problem of grooming, so I was quite disappointed when I read the committee report and found that grooming, in and of itself, would not be covered. I agree with committee members' concerns about the omission from the bill of specific reference to grooming. I am equally disappointed by the minister's refusal thus far to change her mind on that point.</p><p>In paragraph 17 of its report, the committee states that it is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"extremely concerned about the response from the Minister\".</p><p>That is a pertinent comment, because the failure to criminalise grooming per se is, I believe, a mistake. To target the actions subsequent to grooming, although it is a welcome step in the right direction, does not go far enough. We must outlaw the act of grooming, not only the subsequent actions. As the minister said in her opening remarks, the issue is not just about the physical damage that can be done to children when such acts take place; even if a physical act does not take place, emotional and psychological damage can often occur before any meeting or any sexual act takes place.</p><p>Although I understand the difficulties in legislating in this area and in properly defining how we deal with offences, I fail to understand&#8212;as I believe most people will fail to understand&#8212;the Executive's reticence on the matter. The act of grooming children in and of itself cannot have an innocent purpose and should therefore be deemed to be an offence, without the need to travel, the intention to travel or the possession of condoms while travelling being used as evidence. The committee was quite correct to point out that section 1 of the bill will make at best only a marginal difference in tackling the threat from paedophiles.</p><p>I turn to age limits. I agree with the Executive and with the committee on definition of a child as a person under 16, but I do not agree with the Executive on the definition in section 1 of who can commit the offence&#8212;it seems entirely likely that a person between the ages of 16 and 18 could commit such an offence. Unfortunately, there have been cases of persons in that age range and below who have been involved in such activity. I believe that, at the very least, the age limit for an alleged offender should be lowered from 18 to 16. However, the committee's suggestion that no age limit be set and that it be left to the discretion of <place-holder colnum=\"15562\"/> the Crown Office and other agencies to decide on the correct action to take in each case is attractive. That would provide maximum flexibility in dealing with young people who are alleged to have committed such offences, but would not set artificial age barriers to prosecuting someone who is young, if their acts or behaviour are clearly shown to have been predatory.</p><p>On the number of times that a person has to communicate with a child before an offence is committed, I believe that the Executive has got that wrong. I wholeheartedly agree with the committee and other members who have stated that it is the content and context of communications that is the key to proving the offence, rather than the number of communications. That loophole must be closed to ensure that no child is endangered as a result of a technicality about the number, as opposed to the intent of, communications.</p><p>Frankly, I have little sympathy for the argument that the Executive seems to suggest, which is that it does not want the offence to catch people who engaged in grooming activity once but decided to take no further action. The minister is quoted as suggesting that in paragraph 68 of the committee's report. Does that mean that if someone engages in grooming with different children, but never more than once with each child, they should not be prosecuted? Is the emotional and psychological damage that can be caused by grooming in and of itself not reason enough for prosecution? The question is at the heart of why I believe that grooming, and not only the subsequent actions, should be an offence. Another reason for my belief in making grooming itself the offence is that the person who grooms may not be the person who travels. Therefore, the section 1 offence would seem not to apply to such people.</p><p>I certainly support the Executive's position on opposing a blanket marriage exemption; it made very good points to the committee on that.</p><p>In conclusion, all parts of the activity should be caught by the bill, which is about protecting children. That means that grooming, travelling or even persuading a child to travel should all be covered. Although I support the intent of the bill and its general principles, I believe that it will need to be amended at stage 2 if it is to be an effective tool against people in our society who intend to harm children in this way.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336575", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protection of Children and Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the bill.

The current arrangements are far from perfect. When it was time for my daughter to attend nursery school, we duly completed the local authority form, which included spaces to state whether we wanted mornings or afternoons and which nursery we wanted our child to attend. We asked for mornings and for a place at the nearest nursery, which happened to be located in the primary school that my daughter would be attending the following year. Some time later, the letter from the council arrived informing us of the offer that it was making us. We found that instead of mornings in a nursery within walking distance of our house, we were being offered afternoons in a nursery in a different area that was not within walking distance. Given that there is no direct public transport route between where we live and <place-holder colnum=\"15218\"/> the nursery and that we did not have access to a car, it was impossible for us to accept the offer.</p><p>There is no point in saying that nursery provision is available to all, because that is not the case on the ground. The reality is that many parents cannot take up offers because of accessibility problems. We rejected our offer, because it was completely useless. It is no use having places available if they do not match the needs of parents. Places must match what families need. Therefore, they must be accessible to families and, in particular, to mothers, given that the burden of child care usually falls disproportionately on women.

The main problem is that provision simply does not meet the needs of women who wish to return to employment. Two hours of child care per day is not good enough. Women who want to, and often need to, return to work while their children are young depend on child care provision. The provision of two hours per day completely fails to help, even if a woman wants to take up part-time employment. Perhaps when the minister winds up he will be able to identify a single job that would allow a woman to work for an hour, or an hour and a half at the most, per day. Two hours' child care does not equate to two hours' work when travelling time is taken into account. That is why we must move on and provide a full half-day's child care at the very least.

I particularly praise the fire service. The work done by operational firefighters, fire safety officers and non-uniformed support staff clearly creates the most effective and efficient public service in the country. That opinion might be slightly biased, given my 10-year service in Strathclyde fire brigade. However, it is an excellent service that responds when the public calls and is there to save lives and property. We are all very thankful for that.</p><p>I support the bill because we believe that it is essential to have a modern fire service at the start of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The fire service requires modern legislation and there is a lot to commend in the bill.</p><p>One of the smaller things that has not been mentioned so far but is worth referring to is some of the name changes. For example, firemasters are now chief fire officers. The term \"firemaster\" is an old term and suggests that the person at the top of the fire brigade will always be a man. Although that is only a small change, it is welcome. Changing the term \"fire brigades\" to \"fire and rescue services\" means that the name much more accurately reflects the work that the service does. It does not just deal with fires; it deals with a range of other incidents.<place-holder colnum=\"14618\"/></p><p>On that point, I welcome the inclusion of road traffic accidents in the bill. That is a positive step. I also applaud the emphasis on protecting firefighters that is included at chapter 5A of the bill. Again, that is a positive step.</p><p>As the minister has just said, modernisation of fire safety legislation is central to much of the bill. It is one of the most important shifts in emphasis in the bill. The idea that we consider causes and do not just deal with problems once they have arisen is an important step in the right direction. The emphasis on fire safety legislation in the bill is therefore very welcome.</p><p>I am also very pleased to acknowledge Bill Butler's amendments to include the trade unions in any negotiating body and I am pleased that those amendments have been agreed to. Again, that is a good move and I thank Bill Butler for those amendments.</p><p>I was disappointed by some aspects of the bill. A replacement body for the Scottish Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council is not in the bill. I will certainly be paying close attention to the consultation in that area and to any regulations that the Executive proposes to create a new non-statutory body. I hope that the minister will be as good as his word and will create an effective, efficient and powerful body to advise him and his team.</p><p>I am also slightly disappointed that only RTAs, along with firefighting, have been included on the face of the bill, as there are other emergency incidents that could and, possibly, should have been included. Chemical and nuclear incidents, flooding and rail emergencies are well-known examples of incidents that could have been included on the face of the bill, instead of being left to ministerial order. I hope that the issue will be cleared up by ministerial order and that provision will be made for all such incidents.</p><p>It is also unfortunate that the opportunity has not been taken to consider who should be responsible for the maintenance of fire hydrants. We discussed the issue during consideration of stage 3 amendments a moment ago, but I think that the current system lacks logic and is basically inefficient. It is not just about transferring resources from one organisation to another. At the moment, when Scottish Water identifies a broken fire hydrant, it informs the fire service. When the service has inspected the hydrant and agreed that it is broken, it raises an order with Scottish Water, which sends out someone to replace it. The bill is sent to the brigades, which pay Scottish Water. In my view, that is not a particularly logical or efficient system. The whole matter must be looked at again.<place-holder colnum=\"14619\"/></p><p>I put on record our reservations about where fire services in Scotland may end up. Although we support the bill in general terms, it is important that I indicate our concerns for the future. If there is an attempt in the future to contract out fire brigade services, we will oppose it. If there is an attempt to cut control rooms, staff and safety, we will fight such proposals. If there is an attempt to undermine a first-class public service through privatisation, we will do everything in our power to prevent that from happening. I hope that the minister and the Executive will not go down that road. Down south, privatisation, contracting out and cuts have been mentioned as possibilities, but I hope that the idea that those will improve the service will have no place in the Parliament.</p><p>With the general reservations that I have expressed, I welcome the bill and the move forward that is being made. I welcome the fact that we are emphasising fire safety legislation and putting it at the heart of our fire safety work. The Scottish National Party will support the bill at decision time this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334154", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I start by supporting the minister's comments and praising many of those involved in the process.

We have seen notable improvements over the past few years but, as other members have said, there is still some way to go.</p><p>I welcome the Lord Advocate's announcement that victims and, where appropriate, their families will be informed of the reasons why some charges are not pressed or are changed, or why a whole case is dropped. We welcome that extremely important measure. It is long past the time when the Executive should have arrived there, but we are all grateful for a policy change that will allow people who are on the receiving end of crime to understand more about the process that the service uses and the reasons why charges are dropped or changed. As I said, that is a most welcome development.</p><p>I take this opportunity to praise the work of the staff in the victim information and advice service. The fact that they have helped more than 47,000 victims and vulnerable witnesses is testimony to their hard work and their dedication to the cause. It is extremely important that the service be supported and expanded, so I am pleased that it will be rolled out across all Scotland. Everyone is in favour of providing more care for victims of serious crime, for vulnerable witnesses and for bereaved relatives. It is long past the time when an organisation such as VIA should have been introduced, but I am pleased that it is now in place.<place-holder colnum=\"14474\"/></p><p>By providing information and advice both on the legal system and on what people should expect, VIA staff make an invaluable contribution to the smooth running of the justice service. We have heard many examples, some from personal experience, of how little knowledge and information was previously made available to people who became involved in the justice service through being witnesses or jurors or through being victims of crime. By clearing things up and giving information and assistance, VIA makes an extremely important contribution. As Karen Whitefield said, VIA staff also keep victims and witnesses updated on the progress of cases, and make them familiar with court proceedings. Where they deem that to be necessary or appropriate, the staff can put victims and witnesses in touch with organisations&#8212;a particularly useful function that ensures that the service is connected to the outside world The introduction of VIA is one of the most important improvements of recent years for ordinary users of the court system.</p><p>However worthy and welcome such developments are, what good are they if budget restraints mean that a witness must sit in the same room as the accused or the family or friends of the accused? Familiarisation of victims and witnesses with the courtroom will count for little if, the first time they turn up to the court, they are confronted by the very people against whom they are to give evidence. Although the introduction of VIA is welcome, it is regrettable that many witnesses and victims must still share the same space in court as the alleged assailant while they wait to give evidence. The Executive must acknowledge that that is an on-going problem and it must commit resources to ensure that the problem is eradicated in the near future. Quantifiable targets would help. I know that providing more physical space in many older court buildings might prove to be difficult, but it is important that we target the problem and deal with it in the near, rather than the distant, future.</p><p>Much of our debate has rightly centred on the resources that are available to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. The marked increase in resources for the service is certainly welcome, but those resources have been needed to allow the service to fulfil its expanded role in the past few years. In effect, the Executive has told us that it is piling in money to the service, but it should also consider the additional money that the justice system could use if it was not required to hand over money to the Treasury in London. For example, in a reply to a parliamentary question from my colleague Kenny MacAskill two weeks ago, the Executive confirmed that the Scottish Executive has handed over almost &#163;12 million in district court fines to the London Treasury over the past few years. I listened with interest to the Lord Advocate's figures on seizures under the <place-holder colnum=\"14475\"/> Proceeds of Crime Act 2002&#8212;if I remember rightly, he mentioned figures of &#163;2.5 million from seizures, &#163;3 million from cash seizures and &#163;227,000 from civil recovery&#8212;but although I welcome the additional moneys that are being brought into the system, I am sure that the Lord Advocate will agree that the seizures have been slow to come through and that much of the money has been siphoned off to the London Treasury.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13333679", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo the congratulations that have already been expressed by many members, including Karen Whitefield just a moment ago, on the work that the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General have done in improving a service that a previous Justice 2 Committee rightly identified as having some deep problems.

Procurators fiscal are clearly often overburdened, but it is equally clear that some accused make calculated attempts to slow down the justice process and to avoid being taken to court by various technical manoeuvrings. It is important that reforms go through to block such attempts.</p><p>The High Court reform, the impact of that reform on the sheriff courts and the impact of the likely <place-holder colnum=\"14476\"/> reform to the district courts will all affect the efficiency of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. Several changes need to be implemented as a result of the High Court reform, but the idea that flowed from much of that work was the need for a cultural change in the way in which defence and prosecution operate. The idea of cultural change was widely welcomed by all those who are involved in the system, but that much-desired change will have a significant impact on the operation of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. The reforms that were intended to improve the efficiency of the High Court include areas that impact greatly on the work of COPFS. For example, it was envisaged that the presumption of early disclosure on the part of the Crown would assist the defence to prepare cases and thereby reduce the number of times cases were postponed. It is clear that continual postponements will do nobody any good and will only lead to inefficiency in the system, an increased workload and greater pressure on the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p><p>The same is true of some of the other changes that are being introduced, such as preliminary hearings and fixed trial dates. Although those are welcome changes, they will impact on the service. It is essential that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service work as efficiently as possible; that is necessary in order that it can meet the deadlines that will be expected of it following the changes. However, changes in the High Court, the sheriff court and perhaps the district court will all have an impact on the service's ability to carry out its functions efficiently and speedily.</p><p>It is fair to say that it is too early to say whether the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will be able to deal with the new pressures and challenges that will confront it as a result of changes elsewhere in the system, but I hope that the Executive has got the reforms and the matching resources right and that they result in the kind of service that we all want.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13333679", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not object to co-operation with the customs service, but the fact that the amount of money that can be kept in Scotland is capped is still a bit of a problem.

It is a never-ending story.</p><p>What other country in the world would hand over control of its legal system to another country, and what Parliament would hand over control of its legal system to another Parliament? Indeed, what parliamentarians would willingly surrender control of their legal system to the whims of parliamentarians in another Parliament? The answer to that question is parliamentarians who have no self-belief, no confidence in their own country and their fellow citizens and no ambition for their country&#8212;in other words, the members of the various British nationalist parties who inhabit this Parliament and who will defend neither Scotland's interests nor, in this case, Scots law.</p><p>In this Parliament, we are constantly told that Scotland's interests will be defended by Scottish MPs in Westminster and that we should not worry about Sewel motions because Scottish Labour, Liberal and Tory MPs are fighting our corner in London. Perhaps we should look at the facts. On Monday, when the Constitutional Reform Bill had its second reading in the Commons, how many Scottish Labour MPs spoke in that important debate? None. Perhaps they had an excuse; perhaps they all turned up but were not called to speak. However, that is not the case. Only one <place-holder colnum=\"13646\"/> back-bench Labour MP bothered to turn up, and he only popped in for about 10 minutes&#8212;10 minutes out of a debate that lasted from 3.30 in the afternoon until 10 at night. That is not a case of Scottish Labour MPs defending Scottish interests; it is a case of Scottish Labour MPs ignoring Scottish interests.</p><p>What about the Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs? Were they any better? Of course not&#8212;just like the Labour MPs, not one Scottish Liberal Democrat MP bothered to speak in the debate and only one turned up for a few minutes.</p><p>Last&#8212;and also least&#8212;the lone Scottish Tory MP, Peter Duncan, did not even consider the issue to be important enough to turn up for or vote on. So much for the idea that Scottish Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory MPs are the defenders of Scotland.</p><p>However, the unionists in this Parliament will tell us that, even if Scottish MPs are not present, we can rely on MPs from the rest of the United Kingdom to watch out for our interests. Here is an example of what they think. Responding to the suggestion that Scottish law should be decided in Scotland by Scottish courts, the Tory front bencher, Jonathan Djanogly, asked:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"how would the court command more respect by moving from the nation's seat of power to less prestigious surroundings?\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-01-17.646.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>,<em> House of Commons</em>, 17 January 2005; Vol 429, c 649.]</citation></p><p>That attitude makes it clear that MPs from the rest of the United Kingdom could not care less about Scottish interests. They view Scots law as inferior and Scotland as some sort of political and actual backwater.</p><p>Scottish matters should be dealt with in Scotland, devolved matters must be dealt with in Scotland and Scots law should be dealt with by Scottish judges in Scottish courts. Anything less is unacceptable.</p><p>Once again, we have seen that we cannot trust Scottish Labour, Scottish Liberal Democrats or Scottish Tories. They will not defend Scotland's interests in Westminster; we must do that here in Scotland's Parliament. What was the purpose of setting up a Scottish Parliament if we are to send Sewel motions to Westminster week after week so that that Parliament can rule on devolved matters? We are continually told that the Executive parties want Scottish solutions to Scottish problems. If that is the case, why on earth are they asking Westminster to rule on devolved matters? We must do that here in Scotland's Parliament.

I acknowledge that progress has been made in a number of those areas, but I will concentrate my remarks on the final category&#8212;that of witness protection, not just at court but also before and after the trial.</p><p>Although some degree of witness protection is available from certain police forces, including Strathclyde police, other forces operate such a policy on an ad hoc basis. That is simply not good enough. We need a properly established, specialist witness protection programme. I was sorry to hear the minister's view on the proposal for a Scottish witness protection programme. I understand the need for cross-border co-operation, which is fairly obvious to us all, but that would be entirely possible in the context of a Scottish witness protection programme.</p><p>The fear of crime is palpable in many communities, and so is the fear of retribution by criminals or by the friends, families and associates of those who commit crime against those who come forward with evidence about the people who have been responsible for carrying out crimes in <place-holder colnum=\"13555\"/> their community. The fear of retribution is something that we have as yet not properly addressed in our attempts to assist vulnerable witnesses. We have all heard of high-profile cases in which people who have agreed to be witnesses against criminals have suffered as a result. It is incumbent on the criminal justice system to ensure that people are properly protected from retribution against them by the perpetrators of crime or their supporters.</p><p>There is a widespread view that only big-time criminals, such as those who are involved in the illegal drugs trade or organised crime, take revenge on witnesses. However, people can also fear petty criminals, vandals, young adults and even children trying to stop them coming forward and reporting crime. Many people's lives can be ruined by the actions of petty criminals, who terrorise decent people just because they did the right thing and gave evidence to the police about criminal activity. The psychological impact of such intimidation on individuals and families can be devastating. People experience problems ranging from heightened anxiety to complete mental breakdown. Children often find that their schoolwork suffers: they do not sleep properly; they cannot concentrate while at school; and they are constantly worried about their parents.</p><p>I have no wish to overemphasise or exaggerate the problem, but it is clear that it exists. Even if the fear of retribution far exceeds the likelihood of any such action actually occurring, the mere fact that people are afraid to come forward means that we must act to overcome that. Many other countries around the world have witness protection programmes already. It is time that we caught up in this area of criminal justice.</p><p>Most people have heard of the witness protection system that is in place in the United States of America, but America is far from alone in providing that level of protection to witnesses. For example, in 1996, the Canadian Witness Protection Program Act was passed, and the International Criminal Court has established a victims and witnesses unit. Not only large countries such as Canada and the USA, but small European countries, have such programmes in place. Recently, Macedonia drafted legislation that will establish witness protection measures and create a panel that will be responsible for overseeing the protection programme. When that legislation was announced, Macedonia's justice minister stated that all other countries in the west Balkans have enacted such legislation and that the proposals would bring Macedonia into line with international standards.</p><p>When even countries such as Macedonia are upgrading their criminal justice systems by introducing witness protection programmes, surely <place-holder colnum=\"13556\"/> it is time that the Executive backed the proposals that are outlined in the Scottish National Party amendment, which include a specific Scottish witness protection programme.</p><p>I acknowledge the progress that has been made so far&#8212;my experience on the Justice 2 Committee and, previously, the Justice 1 Committee has allowed me to see much of the good work that has been done for vulnerable witnesses and victims&#8212;but I urge the Parliament to keep the momentum going by supporting the SNP amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13331299", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The needs of victims and witnesses fall into six broad categories: first, getting information throughout the criminal justice process; secondly, emotional and counselling support; thirdly, courtesy, respect and sensitivity to the experience that they have lived through; fourthly, assistance in coping with physical difficulty, speech or hearing impairments or language or cultural differences;...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Stewart", "last_name": "Maxwell", "title": "Mr", "url": "/msp/?m=80074", "house": "4", "member_id": "80074", "person_id": "14044", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "West of Scotland"}, "section_id": "13331299", "hpos": "289", "gid": "2005-01-13.13554.0", "epobject_id": "13331326", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2005-01-13.13527.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14044+section%3Asp#g13554.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "16:16:00", "speaker_id": "80074"}, {"body": "<p>I am sure that the minister agrees that some of the most fragile wildlife habitats that we have are on sites of special scientific interest.

I sympathise with her over the brickbats that she had to endure when she launched the bill. Similar comments were directed at me 18 months ago when I launched the idea of banning smoking in public places in Scotland. She had a worse time over a longer period, as Susan Deacon ably outlined in her opening remarks. It is difficult for a backbencher to introduce a bill. To get all the way to stage 3 and have the bill passed&#8212;which I hope it will be tonight&#8212;is an amazing achievement.</p><p>I also congratulate all the groups and individuals who helped Elaine Smith along the way by supporting both the bill and Elaine in her endeavours. I also put on the record my support for and recognition of the NCT and, in particular, its volunteer breastfeeding counsellors, who do an amazing job for many women throughout the country. My daughter and wife received the benefits of their work a number of years ago.</p><p>As we have heard, Scotland has a national target that, by 2005, more than 50 per cent of women will be breastfeeding at six weeks. It is good that we have that target. I wish that the target was higher and covered a longer period, but we are where we are. It is important that we stride ever forward on that target. Data from the child health surveillance programme show that in 2003 only 36.5 per cent of mothers in Scotland were breastfeeding at six to eight weeks. However, the figures are not the same throughout the country. As others have said, 70 per cent of mothers in Orkney breastfeed, whereas in other areas, the rate is much lower. The lowest rates of breastfeeding are in Lanarkshire NHS Board area, with a figure of 26 per cent, and Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board area, with a figure of just over 27 per cent. There are higher rates in the Borders NHS Board and Lothian NHS Board areas, where the rate is 48 per cent.</p><p>Breastfeeding is a health equality issue, and it is important that we do not lose sight of that fact. There are enormous benefits for babies that have been outlined by many members, but they are worth repeating. Breastfed babies have better <place-holder colnum=\"12113\"/> neurological development, fewer respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, less allergic disease such as eczema and asthma and lower rates of diabetes and childhood obesity. Perhaps it can be seen as an example of joined-up thinking if we think of the bill as part of an anti-obesity strategy in its widest sense. Such a strategy is not just about exercise for older children and what they eat; it is about caring for their health from the day they are born and ensuring that they grow up as healthy young people.</p><p>There are also benefits for mothers. We have heard about less breast cancer, a lower risk of ovarian cancer and fewer hip fractures and bone density problems. Bone density problems are on the increase in Scotland. They are often overlooked and we should pay them particular attention, because as our population gets older we will have to deal with the difficulties that they bring. It is important to use breastfeeding as part of a strategy to defeat bone density problems.</p><p>In July 2004 UNICEF revealed that new mothers in Scotland are more likely to receive effective breastfeeding help in maternity units than are mothers in maternity units elsewhere in the UK. We should be proud of that, but we must ask why Scotland has a lower breastfeeding rate than most of Europe. The answer is clear and relates to society's attitude once a woman leaves the maternity unit and moves back home and into wider society.</p><p>The NCT has said that there is public hostility and has put on record many instances of negative comments and even aggression towards breastfeeding mothers in public places. Public hostility to mothers is likely to affect young and disadvantaged women, who are the least likely to start or to continue breastfeeding. That exacerbates the health inequalities that already exist in Scotland. It is critical that the bill changes public attitudes.</p><p>When my daughter was being fed as a young baby, we did not experience abuse or aggression and we were never thrown out of anywhere or asked to go into a toilet. However, when we sat in public places, whether a park or restaurant, the problem was the sideways glances and the strange looks that we got from other members of the public, who obviously felt that it was not acceptable to breastfeed in a public place, even though we were being extremely discreet&#8212;I was amazed that anyone even noticed that my daughter was being breastfed. We have to effect an attitude change.</p><p>On the criminality issue, I hope that we never see anyone charged with an offence under the bill because I want the outcome to be attitudinal change in our society, not a list of criminal offences for people who own certain licensed <place-holder colnum=\"12114\"/> premises.</p><p>There will be a free vote on the bill for members of the SNP group, as there will be for Liberal Democrats members. I encourage all SNP members to accept the recommendation of the Health Committee and to vote to support the bill at 5 o'clock.</p><p>I quote the policy memorandum, as it sums up my view of what the bill is all about. On page 5 it states:</p><p>\"The message promoted is \"Don't think of it as a woman's right to breastfeed.

The committee's position was that, apart from favouring the abolition of the current council, it took no view on a replacement for the council; therefore, it is clear in the report that that is acceptable. I accepted that at the time, in the spirit of working together with colleagues on the committee. Jackie Baillie's attempt to say that I said something else in committee is nothing more than a cheap shot.</p><p>On Margaret Mitchell's point about the smoking ban, and to answer Mike Rumbles's point, Margaret will find, if she considers the evidence, that there has been no increase in fires in the home where smoking bans have been introduced; in fact, the level of smoking in the home goes down where there is a smoking ban. The evidence from Australia is clear on that point.</p><p>The issue of control rooms is central. The minister said earlier that control rooms are not specifically mentioned in the bill. There is no paragraph in the bill that says that there will be a cut in the number of control rooms or that anything else will happen to control rooms, but it seems clear from the debate today that members understand that the process that is going on will probably result in a cut in the number of control rooms. The choice of Mott MacDonald as consultant loaded the dice from the start. Given that it recommended a reduction in the number of control rooms in England, there was virtually no chance that it would come up with the opposite conclusion for Scotland&#8212;it would have looked ridiculous had it done so. The outcome of its report was inevitable.</p><p>As other members have said, Mott MacDonald's report is flawed. The Finance Committee has pointed out that it was not convinced by the claimed potential savings, and neither am I. The committee discovered that the figures are based on a reduction in the number of control rooms in Scotland from eight to one. I understand that that idea is supported by virtually nobody. It is very unlikely&#8212;in fact impossible&#8212;that those savings could be achieved. The report is based on the number of incidents that are reported to control rooms, but that is misleading, as it should have been based on the number of calls. I am sure that nobody is trying to suggest that some calls should not be answered. Operators must answer all calls; they can ignore none. If an incident occurs and it has one call, one call is answered. If an incident <place-holder colnum=\"12029\"/> has 100 calls, 100 calls are answered. The report is flawed in that area. It has been evidenced, today and in previous Executive statements, that the drive to reduce the number of control rooms in Scotland is for financial reasons, and not for the purpose of service efficiency or to improve the service to the general public. Cutting the number of control rooms will not make a single person in Scotland safer, but it may make some people a lot less safe.</p><p>The minister stated in his evidence to the committee that there is little support for the retention of eight control rooms in Scotland and that 23 of the 32 local authorities support the number of control rooms being reduced to three. I am sorry to say that such twisting of statistics gets politics and politicians a bad name. The fact is that only three fire authorities support a reduction to three control rooms, while five authorities oppose the idea. It is interesting to note that the three authorities that support the idea are those that are earmarked to keep their control rooms. As Sandra White and many others said, it is dishonest to count all 12 local authorities that lie within the Strathclyde fire brigade area as in favour of a cut just because the fire authority is in favour of it. COSLA states clearly that the majority of council leaders, including council leaders in the Strathclyde area, oppose any reduction. Agreement between the FBU, the Chief Fire Officers Association and COSLA is a pretty rare event, yet on this issue they speak with a single, clear voice and ministers, the Executive and the Parliament should listen to them.</p><p>It is clear that if we reduce the number of control rooms, we reduce the robustness and resilience of fire cover&#8212;other members have already covered that. A single control room is extremely vulnerable. It is better to have three than one, but that is not as good as eight. We have all witnessed on the evening news&#8212;virtually every night, unfortunately&#8212;co-ordinated, multiple and simultaneous attacks by terrorists. Why would we make it easier for them by reducing the number of control rooms from the current eight? New York realised its vulnerability after September 11 and I understand that it has decided to increase the number of control rooms in order to create a more robust system. New York is moving in the opposite direction to us and is increasing its ability to survive an attack by having multiple control rooms. Based on its experience, it is increasing the number of control rooms from one to five to build greater robustness into its ability to protect citizens in the event of another attack. We need to pay attention to the lessons that New York has learned.</p><p>One of the many problems that Mott MacDonald has ignored is the fact that there will be a loss of local knowledge if we centralise control rooms&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"12030\"/> many members covered that point. There will be increased problems with local names, slang terms, pronounced local accents and even Gaelic place names. Those problems will slow down response times and will not provide greater security to the public. To give a personal example, about two years ago I was in a remote part of Scotland for the first time in my life. My car broke down and I phoned a national breakdown service whose call centre is located in the south of England. Its staff had no idea where I was and I could not tell them. I knew the rough geographical area but I did not know the name of the road or any local landmarks. I had no way to tell them exactly how to pinpoint my location so that a breakdown vehicle could attend. In the end I was passed through to a local office in the area, which asked me questions such as, \"Did you pass Jimmy's caravan park? Are you anywhere near the river? Can you see a hill from where you are?\" The staff pinpointed exactly where I was using not maps, but local knowledge. A breakdown vehicle was dispatched and it was there within the hour. That is the kind of local knowledge that individuals in control rooms hold in their heads, as Bruce Crawford ably pointed out.</p><p>Paragraph 32 of the committee's report was the subject of much comment in the press at the weekend. It is clear that the Executive has been attempting to spin the idea that the committee supports a cut in the number of control rooms. That is nothing more than an attempt at news manipulation and it bears no relation to the truth. Paragraph 32 is neutral on the appropriate number of control rooms in Scotland as the committee thought that it did not have enough evidence to take a view on the issue. The only exception to that is that the committee completely rejected the lone opinion of Her Majesty's chief inspector of fire services for Scotland that Scotland could have a single control room. The report is silent on whether there should be eight control rooms or fewer.</p><p>The logic that is used to reject a single control room applies equally to any cuts to the current eight control rooms: the same problems would occur to a greater or lesser extent. Although the committee was unable to take a view on the issue based on the evidence that it received, I have 10 years' experience of working in the fire service and more than 2 years' experience of working in the largest control room in Scotland, in Johnstone. From that experience, I can tell the Parliament that one size does not fit all. It is necessary to keep the eight control rooms that we have in Scotland, because of geography, efficiency of service, robustness of service and the ability to provide cover and back-up in the event of a major disaster or terrorist attack, and in the interest of serving and safeguarding public safety. No case has been made for a reduction in that number.<place-holder colnum=\"12031\"/></p><p>I turn to part 1 of the bill, which includes the power for ministers to restructure the fire service as they see fit. I and Annabel Goldie dissented from part of the report because we were concerned about the scope of that power. It seems clear to me that the only reason for a minister to have it is so that they can cut the number of brigades in Scotland; it is unlikely that the minister will use it to increase the number of brigades. The reason why that argument holds good is that there is an unbroken connection between the debate about the number of control rooms in Scotland and the debate about the number of brigades. If the Executive cuts the number of control rooms, it will come along afterwards and say that it is inconsistent and inefficient to have three control rooms and eight brigades and that it is forced to bring them into line for reasons of service efficiency and clarity in the chain of command. The decision to amalgamate brigades will be made on the back of a cut in the number of control rooms and will not be based on the merits of a proposal for fewer brigades. It is a back-door way to cut the number of brigades in Scotland. The power that the bill gives ministers is part of that process, and that is why I dissented from paragraph 21 of the committee's report. That paragraph was supported only by the Labour and Liberal Democrat members of the committee; the other three parties did not support the power.</p><p>The minister said earlier that there is no difference from what we have at the moment, but there is a big difference. The power gives the ability to initiate changes. More important, the loss of the advisory council&#8212;a statutory body that acts as a buffer and advises ministers&#8212;will mean an enormous change. The SNP amendment expresses concern about the proposal to remove the statutory standing of any body that replaces the SCFBAC. I appreciate the Executive's argument that the council is too big and unwieldy and I do not have any great concern about restructuring it, changing the number of members, changing its name and making it more efficient, but the Executive has failed to make a convincing argument for changing its statutory standing. If the replacement body is to have any authority, it should be statutory and I urge the minister to reconsider the matter.</p><p>A number of members mentioned the transfer of responsibility for the maintenance of hydrants from fire brigades to Scottish Water. It is a nonsense that Scottish Water is responsible for everything up to the bottom of the hydrant pit and that brigades are responsible thereafter. If the minister wants to do away with unwieldy and bureaucratic systems, here is a chance to do just that. More often than not hydrant faults are identified by Scottish Water employees, who report them to the brigades, who go out and inspect the hydrant, then <place-holder colnum=\"12032\"/> write a report about the problem and do the necessary internal paperwork for it to be repaired. That paperwork goes to various people for approval until it eventually goes to a purchasing officer who issues an order for Scottish Water to repair the hydrant. That is a circular process, not a dynamic system. It is an unnecessary and wasteful paper exercise. By transferring responsibility to Scottish Water we would achieve efficiency savings and hydrants would be repaired more speedily.</p><p>We should have a modern and efficient fire service in Scotland, but the Executive cannot use that as an excuse to try to save money by providing the people of Scotland with a poorer service. Our aim must be to improve the service and not to cut it. We have a number of reservations about the detail of the bill and I hope that the Executive will take our concerns on board. In conclusion, I urge members to support our amendment, which expresses that concern.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327331", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not have to defend my position.

Scotland has the highest rate of female lung cancer in the world and the lowest life expectancy at birth in the European Union. Scotland is only now achieving the levels of life expectancy that were seen in other European countries in 1970. Other countries have made progress with health improvements while we have been left behind. In Scotland, our diet is poor, we drink too much and, most important, we have some of the highest smoking rates in Europe. Smoking is the single biggest cause of preventable premature death and ill health in Scotland. Ireland and Norway have implemented full smoking bans, and with the introduction of those bans health in those countries will take another leap forward. Without a similar ban here, Scotland will fall even further behind.</p><p>Without a ban, it is not only in health that we will lag behind the rest of Europe. A young family that wishes to go on holiday is far more likely to choose Ireland, with its healthy, forward-thinking image and its smoke-free bars and restaurants, than a smoky Scotland. We must not let that happen. If someone wanted to emigrate for a better life, where would they choose: a country that has a reputation as the sick man of Europe, or a vibrant country with a young population and a proven commitment to passing and enforcing public health policies to protect the health of its population? If we do not introduce a full ban, we will endanger our tourism industry, our chances of attracting new, young immigrants, our image in the eyes of the world and the economic benefits that all those things bring.</p><p>Scotland has to make up lost ground in health, tourism and self-belief. It is time for us, as the policy makers of Scotland, to stand up for the health of the people of Scotland. We must not be intimidated by the blustering of vested interests in the tobacco industry, who have no interest in the <place-holder colnum=\"11685\"/> health of Scotland's citizens. Great advances in health are made by legislators who have the courage to act. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Glasgow undertook the massive engineering project to pipe clean water from Loch Katrine. In the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Clean Air Act 1956 was passed, saving many lives in Scotland. Now, we have a Scottish Parliament and we must take responsibility for our health and have the courage to act. By implementing a ban on smoking in public places, we will place ourselves firmly in the footsteps of the great reformers of the past who did so much for public health.</p><p>However, I sound a note of caution and concern. In this week's newspapers there have been leaks stating that the Executive will cave in to pressure from the pro-tobacco lobby during the passage of the legislation by introducing exemptions for certain places. I hope that that is not true; I hoped that the First Minister would make the matter clear today, but I still have slight concerns and I hope that clarity will be forthcoming, perhaps when the Minister for Health and Community Care speaks later. It is entirely unacceptable for certain clubs to be exempt from the ban and I hope that the First Minister will dismiss that proposal out of hand. It is not acceptable for certain groups to be allowed to use their money to avoid the law. People should not be exempt from a ban just because they pay to join an upmarket club. Money should not be the deciding factor, and I agree with the Scottish Licensed Trade Association when it says that there must be a level playing field.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13326685", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smoking"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the First Minister for his statement and for his personal comments on the work that I have done since I was elected on trying to achieve a smoking ban in Scotland.

I hope that we all support the idea that we should protect our emergency workers in all circumstances and not just in emergency circumstances. Many members who have spoken today also spoke in the debate back in January, when we all welcomed the intention to protect emergency workers.</p><p>I commend my colleagues on the Justice 1 Committee. They must have thought that they had it easy when they received a small four-page bill, but it ended up as a wrestling match. I am glad that the wrestling match was not with one another but with the bill, the explanatory notes and the policy memorandum, which were not up to the job and left the committee in great difficulty throughout the process.</p><p>Many members have talked about protecting emergency workers. That is all well and good, but I clarify that the bill is not intended to protect emergency workers in all circumstances; it protects them in emergency circumstances. Understanding that is crucial. Many of the witnesses and the people who gave written evidence failed to understand that fundamental point.</p><p>The bill is narrowly drawn. I have great concern that it will not protect emergency workers in the way that we want to and in the way that they believe that it will protect them. The bill is also a bit of a missed opportunity, as the committee believes that it helps only at the margins. The Executive <place-holder colnum=\"10871\"/> should re-examine the bill and think hard about the comments that we have heard today and which are in the committee's report.</p><p>I echo the comments that many members of different parties, including Michael Matheson and Bill Butler, have made about statistics. The committee wrote to the Executive and to the minister several times. I and others, I am sure, also asked the minister in his evidence session about the lack of information on the number of attacks on emergency workers in emergency circumstances and the trend in the statistics. I am afraid to say that we never received those figures. We received some information, which was about the number of attacks on various groups of workers, such as doctors and firefighters, but it was incomplete and did not concern attacks on emergency workers in emergency circumstances. The lack of statistical information to back up the bill's policy intention is a serious flaw.</p><p>That is indicative of the Executive's poor thinking and lack of logic about, and sloppy attitude to, the bill. The committee was provided with no statistical evidence to support the bill's rationale. I agree that many attacks are occurring and that even the evidence that we received seems to show that the number of attacks on emergency workers is rising, but we do not know whether those attacks are on emergency workers in emergency circumstances.</p><p>The policy memorandum did not deal properly with the alternatives, several of which Bill Aitken mentioned a moment ago. One is the common law. The Lord Advocate issued strengthened guidance only a few months ago and we have not seen whether that will deal with the problem. Several witnesses talked about plea bargaining in such aggravated cases. Implementing section 13 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 is a possibility, as is implementing the summary justice review recommendation that sentencing powers should be increased to 12 months and a &#163;20,000 fine. Many of the arguments for those proposals are valid and the Executive did not explain properly the reasons why it rejected them and decided to go down the legislative route.</p><p>The committee was far from convinced by the arguments of the Executive and the minister about the bill. That is clear from the debate, and that nearly led us to reject the bill at stage 1, not because we do not want to support emergency workers, but because the bill's ineptitude and the lack of background information, statistical evidence and a rationale were unacceptable.</p><p>I will not go through all the different categories in the bill. We have heard many arguments about who should and should not be included, but I want to highlight a couple of groups of people. I agree with what Jackie Baillie said about the Loch Lomond Rescue Boat and other inland or estuary <place-holder colnum=\"10872\"/> rescue boats that basically do the same job. I think that there is a rescue boat on the Black Isle at the northern edge of the Kessock bridge.</p><p>Prison officers are mentioned in paragraph 145 of the committee's report. I certainly agreed with the committee's recommendation that prison officers do not meet the criteria that are laid down in the report, but I have changed my mind on the matter. I have done so because I accept the minister's argument and in particular what was said in discussions with representatives of prison officers. I think that there is a mistake in the paragraph, which states that prison staff call the police when they lose control. Prison officers say that they call the police, but the police do no more than patrol the prison's perimeter. It is the prison officers who deal with situations inside the prison, which puts a different light on such situations. Perhaps the committee was not fully aware of that when the paragraph was written.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13324441", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Emergency Workers (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the intention behind the bill.

I do not understand the difference between attacks on emergency workers in emergency circumstances and attacks on them in non-emergency circumstances. For example, will the minister explain whether a false alarm or a malicious call will be covered by the bill? Such things do not seem to be covered in sections 1(4) and 1(5), as they are not emergency circumstances. Perhaps the minister could explain further.</p><p>A possible solution to the problems is to simplify the whole process and the bill. One of the greatest fundamental difficulties with the bill lies in the bringing together of emergency workers and emergency circumstances. Emergency workers can be called on to deal with emergency circumstances at any time. Therefore, it would be much more sensible to concentrate on on-duty situations, as the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 does, <place-holder colnum=\"10873\"/> so that if doctors, nurses, paramedics, firefighters and others are on duty, they will receive protection for being emergency workers at all times and not only in emergency circumstances.

This Parliament was established to provide Scottish solutions to Scottish problems by repatriating to Scotland at least some powers over our own affairs. It was not established in order that Labour and Lib Dem members could snuff out one of the few uniquely Scottish institutions that has survived the pressure to conform to English law during almost 300 years of union.

How can such treatment of the most vulnerable in our society be reconciled with the Executive's worthy and lofty statements? Frankly, I do not believe that it can.

The health service is a safety net for us all, which is why so many members feel so desperate about the situation&#8212;not only in the west of Scotland and in Argyll and Clyde but throughout Scotland.</p><p>I pay tribute to all the MSPs from every party, party activists, community activists, doctors, nurses, other medical and health staff, the local press and members of the public who have been involved in the campaign north and south of the river&#8212;whether it be in the areas of Inverclyde that Duncan McNeil mentioned or right up into the areas of Argyll that are also affected by the changes. NHS Argyll and Clyde covers a massive area&#8212;from Barrhead to Oban, and Tyree to Dumbarton, and it includes Paisley and Inverclyde. <place-holder colnum=\"9850\"/></p><p>That is an enormous geographical area, which is why the centralisation of services will not work.</p><p>Before there was any loss of service and before the cutbacks started, the travelling time to Vale of Leven for many people was enormous. If someone came from Campbeltown or Oban, the travelling time was ridiculous to start with. The situation now, particularly for those from parts of Argyll, after cutbacks, rationalisation or centralisation&#8212;whatever one calls it&#8212;is much worse. We have already seen the loss of accident and emergency services and maternity services, to name but two, but now there are proposals to remove even more services, including elderly care, care for the mentally ill and even chiropody services. Frances Curran mentioned a number of others. Many services seem to be going from the NHS Argyll and Clyde area.</p><p>Health board managers have to explain their proposals properly. In their documents that they have produced, they seem to be saying that they are taking things away, but what will be in their place? People are worried about their services. If elderly units are to be closed and chiropody services are to be taken away, managers must explain what the alternatives are. I do not see the detail on the alternatives in the documents.</p><p>Inverclyde and the Vale of Leven have been offered either an ambulatory care and diagnostic unit or an intermediate hospital. I attended a public meeting not so long ago at which a letter was read out from local doctors who said that even they did not know what an intermediate hospital was. If they do not know what it is, how on earth are the rest of us supposed to understand what it is? I understand what an ACAD is, because I have seen the fights over them in Glasgow, in particular on the south side of Glasgow, where the Victoria infirmary is to be replaced by an ACAD. ACADs are hospitals with no in-patient services and no accident and emergency. Frankly, I do not think that they offer the hospital services that are needed north or south of the Clyde.</p><p>The Royal College of Nursing made important comments about the consultation process. I was concerned by some of the things that it said and two of the comments in particular struck me. The RCN stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the document was developed and produced without staff involvement or through partnership arrangements\".</p><p>That is a disgrace. If the managers are not involving the staff in the process, what on earth are they doing? The RCN also stated that there was a</p><p class=\"indent\">\"lack of clarity in the consultation document about how current services will be provided in the future and ... that it seems likely fewer services will be provided locally than at present.\"<place-holder colnum=\"9851\"/></p><p>That is the point that I was trying to make about the document: all we can see are cutbacks. We cannot see the clear vision. The reason why we have health board managers is to provide that vision. If the managers cannot provide it in the documents, frankly, I do not know whether they are doing their job properly.</p><p>If the services go, many people will have to travel to either Glasgow or Paisley. For people on the north of the Clyde, there is a superficially attractive solution in the transport corridor north of the river. I can see why it might be attractive, but more distance will be added to the journeys for people from the more distant parts of Argyll. Given that Greater Glasgow NHS Board is cutting back and centralising its services, it will be no solution for Argyll and Clyde to say that people can go to Glasgow.</p><p>The process that is going on in Argyll and Clyde&#8212;but also in every part of Scotland&#8212;is of great concern to people all over Scotland.

I appreciate that.</p><p>I thank the Executive for at least bringing to the chamber a debate on an issue that I believe to be the single biggest public health issue that faces Scotland today. However, the issue is not new. This year marks the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first anti-smoking publication, \"A Counter-blaste to Tobacco\", which was written in 1604 by James VI. Contrary to what members might think, smoking bans in public places are also not new. In 1641, the country of Bhutan banned smoking in government buildings. The argument and debate on the subject and the knowledge about what smoking can do have been around since smoking first appeared in Europe and elsewhere.</p><p>Although most other parts of the world have only recently started to catch up, the movement for change is gathering pace, with bans being introduced in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, all over the United States of America&#8212;including California and New York&#8212;and, most recently, in Ireland and Norway. The idea is one whose time has come and Scotland should join the growing ranks of places around the world in which the protection of public health is the top priority.</p><p>At the moment, Scotland has a voluntary charter, but it has failed. After four years, seven out of 10 pubs allow smoking throughout and a mere one in 10 premises meets all four of the targets in the charter. The voluntary charter was never going to reduce exposure to second-hand smoke. That is because it is possible to comply with the charter without doing a single thing to protect people from environmental tobacco smoke. In fact, all that those who are responsible for a premises need to do is to put up a very small sticker that says \"Smoking Allowed Throughout\", which protects nobody.<place-holder colnum=\"9018\"/></p><p>I welcome the fact that something is finally being done, but it is almost unbelievable that it has taken the Executive and its army of civil servants six months to draw up what can only be called a flimsy survey document; it is a document that a secondary school pupil could have knocked out in an afternoon. The consultation document has a total of six questions on smoking. The fact that it took the Executive six months to think up six questions does not seem like a high work rate to me.</p><p>At a time when we need action, all that we are getting from the Executive is delay and prevarication. Scotland needs a smoking ban in public places. Every year, there are somewhere in the region of 13,000 smoking-related deaths in Scotland. More premature deaths result from smoking than are caused on the roads or by alcohol or any other avoidable cause.</p><p>Of course, what is at issue is not only the number of people in Scotland who are dying, but the numbers who are being made ill. In Scotland, 35,000 hospital admissions every year are as a result of smoking-related diseases, of which the annual cost to the health service is approximately &#163;200 million. Executive members are fond of continually asking, \"If you want to spend money on something else, tell us which schools and hospitals you are going to cut to fund it.\" I ask the Executive, if it does not take the necessary steps to tackle the problem by banning smoking in public places, whose children will not get the education they deserve and which patients will not be treated because &#163;200 million a year is being wasted by having to be used to deal with smoking-related ill health?</p><p>Maybe&#8212;just maybe&#8212;an argument could be made for people's right to self-harm, were it not for the fact that smoking does not just harm those who smoke. Many non-smokers are made ill and killed by other people's smoke, as the minister acknowledged. They are the victims of passive smoking, but they are also the victims of inaction by this Parliament when it comes to protecting their right to not have their health damaged by others. Make no mistake about it: passive smoking damages people's health and kills them.</p><p>This is not the first consultation on the topic that we have had in this Parliament; it is the fourth. Kenny Gibson had a consultation, I had a consultation, the Health Committee had a consultation and the Executive is carrying out the fourth consultation.</p><p>It is no surprise that passive smoking damages people's health. Tobacco smoke contains 4,000 chemicals, including 47 regulated hazardous wastes, 5 regulated hazardous air pollutants, more than 50 known cancer-causing agents, and chemicals that increase blood pressure, damage <place-holder colnum=\"9019\"/> the lungs and cause abnormal kidney function. The World Health Organisation has classified environmental tobacco smoke as a human carcinogen. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified it as a class A human carcinogen for which there is no safe level of exposure. That puts it in the same class as asbestos, arsenic, benzene and radon gas, yet those who are opposed to a public places smoking ban claim that environmental tobacco smoke does no harm&#8212;a claim that, quite frankly, defies all logic and evidence.</p><p>In children, passive smoking has been linked to cot death, ear infections, respiratory infections, the development of asthma and asthma attacks in those who are already affected, as well as low birth weight and premature birth. In adults, passive smoking is involved in a range of cancers, particularly lung cancer, as well as heart disease, bronchitis, asthma and stroke.</p>", "hdate": "2004-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13319789", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smoke-free Environments"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is obvious that the minister is embarrassed by John Reid's remarks and that he does not want to comment on them.

In a place called Helena, in Montana, a public places smoking ban was in place for just six months. Heart attack rates in Helena in the months and years before the ban ran at a constant rate but, during the period of the ban, heart attack admissions to hospital fell by 40 per cent. When the ban was lifted, the heart attack rate returned to the pre-ban level. The evidence of research such as that is clear: passive smoking kills and maims, while smoking bans save lives and protect health.</p><p>Part of the debate rightly centres around promoting choice, but it is not the deceitful concept of choice for the few that the tobacco companies <place-holder colnum=\"9020\"/> push that is important; it is choice for all. As things stand, smokers have a choice, but non-smokers have no choice. What choice is there for a family with children or for those who suffer from asthma, a heart condition or a chest or lung illness? The reality is that there is no choice for the 70 per cent of the adult population in Scotland that does not smoke. If they wish to go out for a drink or a meal, they must decide whether to go out and breathe in second-hand smoke, with all that that entails, or to not go out at all. If Scotland followed the example of other places around the world and banned smoking in public places, there would be genuine choice for all, because smokers and non-smokers could enjoy a night out and staff would not be faced with the stark choice between risking their health on the one hand and facing unemployment on the other.</p>", "hdate": "2004-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13319789", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smoke-free Environments"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I did not say that either.

The Scottish and United Kingdom Governments do not endorse ventilation as the answer, and the European Commission's view is clear from its September 2003 statement, in which it said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Changes in ventilation rates during smoking do not have a significant influence on the air concentrations of tobacco components.

As many other members <place-holder colnum=\"8337\"/> have stated, it is probably overdue. The children's hearings system was a radical change from the system that went before, but it is not perfect&#8212;no system is&#8212;and it is now more than 30 years old. I pay tribute to all who work in the system, especially the volunteer panel members, because, as has been stated, if it was not for the volunteers in the system, we would have no system to work with.</p><p>The historical context of the children's hearings system is extremely important, because we must remember why we moved away from punishing children through the courts. In the 1960s, there was a great deal of concern that the legal system was letting young people down. It was felt that the system did not require them to face up to their actions and that it thereby contributed to their reoffending. Therefore, Lord Kilbrandon was asked to chair a committee to look into the problem, and one of the most noticeable things to come out of his review was the fact that the children who faced the criminal system were often the same ones who were in need of care and protection.</p><p>The children's hearings system was formed out of the work that Lord Kilbrandon and his committee did and, as many members have said, the hearings first sat in 1971. The system was to be grounded on a welfare-based, child-centred philosophy to deal with vulnerable children who required care and protection or needed their offending behaviour tackled. That ethos is crucial to the system's success, and I was glad to hear the minister put aside the comments that were made by <em>The Herald</em> last week and say that it is not the Executive's intention to split the system into a care and protection system and a punishment system. To do so would be to go backwards, rather than to improve the system.</p><p>The children's hearings system quickly became the envy of countries throughout the world for the humane and effective way in which it dealt with children and young people. Several members have mentioned that no other country has replicated exactly what we have done in Scotland. It is not unusual that no other country has done exactly what we have done, but other countries have learned important lessons and have taken the philosophy of that work. Members must remember that transferring from a juvenile court punishment system to a child-centred system, as we did in the 1960s and 1970s in Scotland, was a radical step. It would have been difficult for other countries to follow that example exactly and it is unfair to criticise them for not doing so.</p><p>I am glad that the minister cleared up the supposed leaks from the Executive, which led us to fear that it was considering the break-up of the unique children's hearings system. The problem is <place-holder colnum=\"8338\"/> not the hearings system, but successive Governments' continual underfunding of that system. The parlous state of support because of the lack of appropriate disposal options and a properly funded social work system is an endemic problem, as many members have said. The children's hearings system has considerable power to make recommendations, including to take a child away from his or her home into foster care, a residential school or secure accommodation&#8212;although that relies on spaces in secure accommodation being available, which is not always the case, due to the on-going or, one could say, endemic shortages in that area.</p><p>Research continues to show that those who offend and those who require care and protection often face the same difficulties. Research by the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration shows that more than 60 per cent of children who offend have already been referred to the children's hearings system, usually first between the ages of five and nine on care and protection grounds. A study written for the youth justice forum in Glasgow in 2001 examined young persistent offenders in Glasgow. It found that the majority of children who persistently offended had first appeared for non-offending reasons at an average age of eight. It also found that almost all those children came from unstable and violent homes and had originally been referred because of physical abuse, lack of parental care or alleged sexual abuse. Johann Lamont's comments about the problems in individual homes and dealing with problems robustly at an early stage are particularly appropriate in that context.</p><p>Even after 30 years, and despite all the good work that has been done, the link between young offenders and children who need care and protection is there for all to see. Given all the evidence that connects victims and perpetrators of youth offending, how can the idea of splitting the system into two&#8212;a punitive judicial system and a protective panel system to safeguard young victims&#8212;even be considered?</p><p>In recent years, the number of children who need care and protection has rocketed. In 2001-02, there were 36,820 referrals to the children's hearings system. Of those children, 60 per cent were referred because they were in need of care and protection and only 37 per cent for allegedly committing an offence. In the past decade, referrals for children who have allegedly committed an offence have risen by 14 per cent, but in the same period, referrals for children who have been victims of an offence have risen by 27 per cent. The number of children who have been referred because of a lack of parental care&#8212;neglect, in other words&#8212;has risen by a shocking 247 per cent.<place-holder colnum=\"8339\"/></p><p>Several members' comments about the drugs culture that has arisen over the past two decades are particularly relevant in that context. The drugs scene, and the drugs that are now endemic in our society, have changed things beyond all recognition in the past two decades. There is no way that the Kilbrandon report could have foreseen the changes that drugs would wreak on society in the years to come.</p><p>The children's hearings system has been a great success over a number of years and Scotland should be justifiably proud of it. Given the recent massive rise in the number of neglect cases, the burden on volunteers and staff in the system has become almost intolerable. It is obvious that the lack of resources and of available places&#8212;and, perhaps most important, the drastic shortage of social workers to follow up on the recommendations that children's hearings make&#8212;is the most crucial shortcoming. There is no doubt that many children have been failed by the system, particularly those who are in the care system or are leaving care.</p><p>There is an acceptance that a lack of social workers and other problems in social work are having a detrimental effect on the system. Often, the reasons for delay in the system are caused by problems within social work departments. That is not a criticism of individual social workers and those who work in the system; it is a matter of fact that there are not enough people doing the job. The report from the Council on Tribunals, the Audit Scotland reports, the child protection audit and review and an Executive central research unit report into home supervision all found that social work services were lacking in ways that compromised the children's hearings system's ability to do its job.</p><p>Since 1999, the number of social workers has risen by 8 per cent, as has already been mentioned. However, vacancies have risen by 88 per cent. As Fiona Hyslop mentioned, over the same period, the number of children's social workers has risen by 15 per cent, yet the number of vacancies has risen by 129 per cent. That shows a great unmet need for social work services in general and for children's social work services in particular. The Audit Scotland report found that the shortage of social workers means that about 400 children are not getting the service that they require.</p><p>Until social work issues are resolved, the children's hearings system will continue to fail some children. It is time that the Executive seriously considered the establishment of a McCrone-style committee to address the recruitment problems that are evident in social work services. I urge the Executive to put away any notions of breaking up the children's hearings <place-holder colnum=\"8340\"/> system, to support our policy of a McCrone-style committee to attempt to put an end to the chronic shortage of social workers, and to promise to fund the children's hearings system adequately, particularly downstream from the hearings themselves. By doing so, the Executive could go some way towards ensuring that all children in Scotland who need the care and protection of the system actually receive it.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318195", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the review.

I associate myself with her remarks and in particular with her requests to the minister about the boat's funding arrangements.</p><p>Loch Lomond is one of the most beautiful areas in Scotland and, consequently, one of the most frequently visited. However, despite its many attractions, the loch has many dangers. Without the efforts of the volunteers who crew the rescue boat, the loch would be a more dangerous and less attractive place to visit. For more than 25 years, men and women have given their time and dedication to ensure that the public, including a large number of overseas visitors, can enjoy the delights of the loch, safe in the knowledge that, if anything unfortunate should occur, the rescue boat is ready to come to their aid. During the past 12 months, the boat has attended nearly 60 emergencies and has rescued dozens of people.</p><p>The rescue boat is an emergency service in the true sense of the phrase and its crew are emergency workers. That raises a puzzling aspect of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Bill, which the Executive recently introduced. During the Justice 1 Committee meeting this week, I asked the Executive bill team about the definition of emergency workers in the bill. Section 1(3)(f) includes in the definition:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a member of the crew of a vessel operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institute or a person who musters the crew of such a vessel or attends to its launch\".</p><p>I asked whether members of the crews of emergency rescue boats that are not RNLI boats, such as the Loch Lomond rescue boat and other inshore boats that are crewed by volunteers, should also be classified as emergency workers for the purposes of the bill. Clearly, such boats carry out an emergency service. Their crews do not work full time; they respond to emergencies at the call of the pager, as Jackie Baillie said. Will the minister say&#8212;if he can say at this stage&#8212;whether he will consider supporting an amendment to the bill that I want to lodge at stage 2 to include members of crews on rescue boats other than RNLI vessels? Such people are obviously emergency workers and they carry out sterling work on behalf of the public of Scotland.</p><p>Some examples of the work that the volunteers do might persuade the Executive that those emergency workers should be included in the bill. This year, several boats have been helped after running aground, breaking down or running into trouble in bad weather, which can quickly whip up on the loch. The rescue boat has also had to rush to the aid of several swimmers, windsurfers and <place-holder colnum=\"8274\"/> people carrying out other leisure pursuits who have been involved in accidents or found themselves in difficulties on the loch. As some of us have found to our cost, the loch is often much colder than we imagine when we first look at it.</p><p>Another facet of the team's activity is that it often helps with mountain searches and accidents on the shoreline. For example, last August, a man was injured by a jet-ski while walking along the beach. He suffered a broken leg and was rushed to Luss pier by the rescue boat, where an ambulance took him to the Vale of Leven hospital. Alcohol is the cause of many incidents on and near the loch, a problem that is illustrated by the second case that I will mention. Last May, the rescue boat rushed to help three drunken sailors who ran into bother in a dinghy. I am sure that there are many limericks about drunken sailors, but had it not been for the rescue boat, the situation could easily have ended up as a tragedy.</p><p>The Loch Lomond rescue boat provides a useful and important service. As Jackie Baillie said, the annual cost of running the service is about &#163;10,000, which is raised mainly from donations. I fully support her call for the Scottish Executive to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"investigate the provision of stable funding\".</p><p>Such an important function, which, as I said, is better described as an emergency service, should not be funded on the whim of people's generosity. We need to bring long-term stability to the funding of what is a vital service so that it can plan for the future. By including non-RNLI rescue boats in the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Bill and by providing stable funding, we would show that we are serious about supporting important volunteer organisations such as the Loch Lomond rescue boat.

Where is the justice in a system that results in someone who earns &#163;100,000 a year paying the same fine as someone who earns &#163;10,000? Proportionally, who pays more? Surely justice is meant to be equal for all and seen to be equal for all. The only fair way to do that is to take into account the ability to pay. We must make the fine fit the circumstances of the person so that both well-off and poor offenders feel the sentence equally. A blanket fine system penalises the poorer members of society much more than the well off. Indeed, it could be argued that fines that are not related to income levels almost completely negate the punitive effect of fining the better off. If everyone knew that the fine that they faced was going to be related to their financial circumstances, that might influence their behaviour, possibly leading to a decrease in the amount of minor offences committed and the consequent savings that that would provide.</p><p>The second issue that I want to highlight was mentioned earlier by Pauline McNeill and is strongly supported by the SNP: weekend or flexible detention for certain types of offenders.

It is crucial to the success of the bill, and I am slightly disappointed that the bill does not, at this point, contain more formal measures. However, I will not go back over the arguments that we had during stage 2. It is important that the culture change happens and that there is co-operation and goodwill from all sides if we are to achieve the ends of speeding up justice and making it fairer and more reliable for all concerned.</p><p>Given that there is no formal process for early disclosure and that we are relying heavily on goodwill and co-operation, I ask the Executive to pay close attention to what happens after the bill is passed so that we get that co-operation and culture change and that there is movement towards a speedier process. I hope that the Executive and the minister will return to the committee with evidence about how the process is moving on.</p><p>Early disclosure of evidence by the prosecution is required for the time limits. When we debated whether the time limit should be 110 days or 140 days, the case was made that early disclosure of evidence in the first part of the system would have allowed the retention of the 110-day rule, but I will not go back over those arguments. Now that we have taken the decision to extend the time limit from 110 days to 140 days, I hope that the result will still be speedier justice. I also hope that 140 days will indeed be the outer limit of the time constraint.</p><p>The requirement for preliminary hearings is one of the most widely welcomed measures in the bill. All parties agree that the introduction of preliminary hearings will make a difference. It should mean that we get earlier pleas, which should free up space within the High Court. I certainly welcome the measure, which I hope can be introduced smoothly into the system.</p><p>The presumption that trial diets will be fixed is an excellent idea, although I still have concerns&#8212;as I <place-holder colnum=\"7838\"/> have had from the beginning&#8212;that the intended policy aim will not be achieved. I hope that there will be fixed trial diets, but we will still have the flexibility of floating trial diets. Although I understand why floating trial diets will still be available, I am concerned that in a couple of years' time we will be told that people use that loophole to get round problems within the system, such that we end up with most trial diets still being floating ones. I hope that that does not happen but, given those concerns, I hope that the Executive will spend time monitoring that issue to ensure that we do not end up in that situation.</p><p>On trials in the absence of the accused, I still hold to the position that I expressed earlier. It would have been better if we had required that all the Crown evidence had been led before the trial of an accused who had absconded could go ahead. Such cases could still have proceeded to judgment if our amendment 115 had been accepted. It is a shame that, once the bill is passed, we will lose the principle that the trial should take place in the presence of the accused, which should be a fundamental right.</p><p>Finally, one of the most pleasing aspects of the bill's passage has been the way in which we have moved from using the language of \"reluctant witnesses\" to that of \"obstructive witnesses\".

In most cases, the accused does not turn up on day 1, the case is adjourned, there is a minor delay until the following day, the person is picked up and the case goes ahead. If there is indeed only a minor delay in most of those cases, we are talking about a very small number of cases in which somebody escapes abroad and avoids justice, and it seems to be heavy handed to lose a fundamental right, such as a person's right to be tried in their presence, as a result of such a small number of cases.</p><p>During the evidence sessions and when we spoke to a number of people in the legal profession, defence lawyers were uneasy about the matter. Many said to us that they would not take on cases in which the accused was not present. In fact, I did not speak to any defence lawyer who said that they would take on a case in which the accused was not present. If the legal profession is so concerned about the matter and thinks that it could not properly represent accused persons who are not present, it does not seem that the matter will be resolved by passing the part of the bill that we are discussing.</p><p>Amendments 115 and 118, in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, would resolve the matter and would keep the fundamental principle intact. I am glad that the minister and the Executive have moved and I agree that amendment 40A strengthens amendment 40 a bit. However, we are talking about a person's fundamental right to be tried in their presence and the right to a fair trial.

I also praise the work of Sheriff McInnes and his team in preparing and producing a thorough piece of work. As has been mentioned, the report is quite large, so although I have taken some time to go through it over the past week, I am sure that I have missed many of the main points.</p><p>The main thing to come out of today's debate is the genuine feeling of most members that it is time that we modernised the summary justice system, brought the district courts into the 21<sup>st</sup> century and moved forward by improving the system so that victims are at the forefront of all that we seek to achieve. Colin Fox obviously felt slightly differently about that. I am sorry that he took that view, because it seems to me that the victims of crime should always be at the front of our minds when we are trying to produce a system of justice for our country. Apart from him, members were generally unified in their approach to making the system work and in accepting that Sheriff McInnes and his team have produced a good report, most of the aspects of which most of us can support.</p><p>The report's most contentious proposal is the abolition of lay justices, which was mentioned by many members, including Michael Matheson, Margaret Smith, Margaret Mitchell, Mike Pringle and Bill Butler. It is important that we spend time thinking about the matter. As Bill Aitken and others said, lay justices have been in existence for between 300 and 400 years and they have done a marvellous job. The deep links that lay justices have to their communities are extremely important. That is highlighted in the note of dissent at annex A of the report. We should be very careful about losing people who are rooted in their communities. It is important that people who deal with the summary justice end of the system have that community link. I am certainly concerned about their abolition.</p><p>In the note of dissent, Sheriff Brian Lockhart and Mrs Helen Murray state:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the onus is on those recommending the abolition of lay justice to demonstrate that it is intrinsically undesirable and unworkable\".</p><p>If there is one criticism of the McInnes report, it is that it has not demonstrated that that is the case. The evidence from the speeches that members from all sides of the chamber have made is that many people feel uneasy about the proposed change.</p><p>I have no declaration of interest to make, as I am not a former JP. I have no connection to the Scottish Court Service or the legal profession, but I am also uneasy with the loss of a system that <place-holder colnum=\"7156\"/> has been in operation for 400 years and which clearly has an intrinsic worth and is rooted in the communities that it serves.</p><p>The dissenters pose a number of questions that need to be answered. They ask:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Is lay involvement in the dispensing of summary justice desirable in principle?\"</p><p>I think that it is. They also ask:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Is it possible and cost effective to improve the delivery of lay justice to fit in with a new unified system and to safeguard and enhance its credibility?\"</p><p>Yes, I think that that is also the case. The dissenters go on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Only if Ministers conclude that the answer to both these questions is 'no' ... should they decide that the correct way ahead is to move to a fully professional summary justice system.\"</p><p>As I have said, I think that the answer to those questions is yes, not no, so I believe that we must think seriously before we make such a major change to our justice system.</p><p>Many members, including Michael Matheson, Annabel Goldie and Mike Pringle, also mentioned the change to remove district courts from local authority control and transfer them to the Scottish Court Service. That is something that we could support. There is good reason for that to happen and it makes sense to unify the courts under a single system, so I certainly do not have any objections in principle to that change. However, as the note of dissent mentions, that change in itself would not lead automatically to the loss of lay justices.</p><p>A number of members raised the transfer of business from the High Court to the sheriff court. It is intended that 20 per cent of the business of the High Court will transfer to the sheriff courts. When that happens, the sheriff courts will have a lot to deal with, particularly in Glasgow. I have grave concerns that, if we transfer material up the way at the same time, we will overload the centre. SNP members are concerned that we must be careful not to make a complete mess of the lower end of the justice scale. As many members have said, 96 per cent of cases are summary cases and it is extremely important that we do not cram everything together and end up with a real mess. In trying to solve a problem at the High Court end and at the district court end, we could make a mess of the whole system.</p><p>Colin Fox stated that at the front of the sheriff court and the back of the sheriff court are two different classes of people. That may be the case in many instances, but the same cannot necessarily be said of district courts. The distinction that he observes is less marked in district courts, where evidence from 2001-02 <place-holder colnum=\"7157\"/> shows that, of the 60 justices appointed, 40 per cent were female. That figure is heartening and I hope that it will rise even further. No statistics are available on whether those who sit on the bench are fully representative of the communities in which they serve. That was a criticism of the district court in the McInnes report, but the note of dissent clearly states that there are no statistics for that aspect of the situation. Therefore, it is unreasonable to suggest that, because it might be true in the sheriff courts, it is also true in the district courts.</p><p>Members asked a lot of questions about structural change, but they did not give many answers. It is extremely important that all those questions are asked, but it is more important that we have some answers. That is why I am curious why the Executive has taken the line that it has taken by going straight to a consultation on Sheriff McInnes's proposals. The Bonomy report was followed by a white paper giving the Executive's views, which was followed by a consultation and then by a bill. Why, in this case, have we gone straight from the McInnes report to consultation, rather than the Executive giving us its views in a white paper?</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13315029", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Summary Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members before me, I welcome the bulk of the proposals in the McInnes report.

He said that, but as the committee's report indicates and as is quite clear, that provision is not contained in the bill, but is in a memo of understanding. A right is not a legal power or right when it is contained in a memo of understanding, which is no more than that.</p><p>The bill states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If it appears to the Secretary of State that ... a person serving a sentence of imprisonment in Northern Ireland ... should be transferred to\"</p><p>another part of the United Kingdom</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in the interests of maintaining security or good order in any prison in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State may make an order for his transfer to\"</p><p>that other part of the United Kingdom</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there to be remanded in custody pending his trial or, as the case may be, to serve the whole or any part of the remainder of his sentence, and for his removal to an appropriate institution there.\"</p><p>The bill does not say, \"unless the Scottish Executive, the Scottish ministers, the First Minister or the Parliament say no\". No matter what the minister said, the bill does not say that and therefore the assurance is not worth the paper that it is written on.</p><p>The Executive says that the bill will have no financial effect. Of course there will be financial effects. Michael Matheson mentioned the cost of keeping a prisoner in a Scottish prison. I agree that there are fixed costs whether or not a prisoner is held, but there are additional costs for every prisoner who is kept in the Scottish Prison Service. It does not seem right that costs should be borne by the Scottish Prison Service budget for prisoners from Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Prison Service should bear those costs.</p><p>The SNP wants to do everything that it can to support the peace process in Northern Ireland. However, that is no reason why we should hand over powers to Westminster yet again. There has been ample time to introduce a Scottish bill on the matter. We could have had a short and simple bill to confirm the ability to transfer prisoners, but that did not happen.</p><p>When the minister appeared before the Justice 1 Committee, I asked him when the bill was introduced at Westminster. The bill was introduced in the first week of December and completed its stages there on 10 February. The bill took two months to go through Westminster, which means that we could have done the same here. The <place-holder colnum=\"6905\"/> minister told the committee that the aim was to ensure that the legislation was passed speedily and that we did not hold it up. Given that the bill was introduced in the first week of December and that it was passed in two months, we could easily have introduced a bill and passed it in time so that there was no delay in Scotland.</p><p>I keep hearing from ministers about the relationship between the Scottish Executive and the Government in London. We hear often about the concordats, the meetings, the discussions and how the Executive and the Government work together closely, hand in hand. Surely that means that ministers did not find out on 3 December that the bill had been introduced&#8212;they knew about it well before that date. I am sure that the minister was well aware that the bill was to be introduced, so even more time was available than the months that I mentioned.</p><p>It is nonsense to suggest that we should give up powers willy-nilly, week in, week out. Phil Gallie's suggestion about transferring prisoners from Scotland was interesting. If we had a Scottish bill, we could have an open debate on that issue here and decide for ourselves whether that was a good suggestion.</p><p>Mike Pringle made the point&#8212;and Pauline McNeill made a similar point&#8212;that it was better to use a Sewel motion because doing so would not waste administrative time. The wasting of administrative time, as Mike Pringle calls it, is what I call the democratic process. Pauline McNeill said that we did not have to spend time on the matter and that we should leave it to Westminster, but that process is what I call democratic scrutiny. The idea that we should give up such scrutiny is an abdication of responsibility, the democratic process and democratic scrutiny. The Scottish Parliament was set up in order to return certain powers to Scotland, so that Scottish people could see that their representatives in the Scottish Parliament could spend time processing and scrutinising matters that affected Scotland. To give up those powers in such a weak-mannered way is nonsensical.</p><p>I reiterate that we do not object to helping the peace process and, in fact, we support it. However, we object to the mechanism that is being used to try to assist the peace process. To prove that, I point out that the SNP supported the principles of the bill in its early stages at Westminster. We support helping the Northern Ireland peace process, but we do not support the handing over of power in such a fashion.</p><p>I have a final question, which I hope that the minister will answer. To which prisons in particular would prisoners be transferred, if that were to happen? Will all prisons be considered? It seems that certain prisons are more suited to taking such <place-holder colnum=\"6906\"/> prisoners than others and I think that the communities who live near those prisons have a right to know whether their local prison is being considered to take some of the most dangerous and disruptive terrorist prisoners in the UK. Communities should be aware that that might happen in the near future.</p><p>As Michael Matheson said, we do not object to supporting the peace process. We are fully behind that, but we object to the Sewel motion and we will vote against it.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13314356", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Here we are yet again&#8212;another week, another Sewel motion.

Perhaps when the deputy minister sums up, he will explain what will happen if health boards fail to abide by section 3, given that many boards are failing to co-operate at present, although a duty to do so does not exist in legislation. If the bill becomes an act and section 3 is approved, what will happen if health boards fail to abide by it?</p><p>I will give three examples that shine a light on the lunacy of the current situation, in which different decisions are taken in different but often neighbouring health board areas.

Neighbouring health boards appear to have taken no cognisance of each other in taking decisions about maternity services provision. The west of Scotland has lost consultant-led services at the Vale of Leven hospital in Dunbartonshire and the Rankin maternity unit in Greenock. When those moves were first mooted, it was stated that mothers-to-be could travel to Paisley to have their babies, if they so wished. However, when it was pointed out that the natural transport corridors for people who live north of the River Clyde and from the Vale of Leven hospital area are up the north side of the river to Glasgow rather than across it&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"6223\"/> there are no decent public transport links between Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire&#8212;it was suggested that patients could choose Glasgow as the place to have their babies.</p><p>Within weeks of the comments by Argyll and Clyde NHS Board, Greater Glasgow NHS Board announced its plans to close the Queen Mother's hospital, which is north of the river, and, in effect, to remove that choice from women in the Dunbartonshire and Argyll areas. If the Queen Mother's hospital is closed, the services will be transferred to the Southern general hospital, which is south of the River Clyde. The lack of joined-up thinking between the two boards is not only a problem of administration; it has a detrimental impact on ordinary patients' lives and on their day-to-day experience of the health service in one of the most crucial areas&#8212;giving birth to their children.</p><p>The second example is the issue that is commonly called postcode prescribing. I will cite the example of a couple who came to see me at a surgery, which highlights the different policies in the health board areas of Argyll and Clyde and Glasgow. The minister will be aware of the issue because I have written to him about it&#8212;it is about differences in fertility treatment between Glasgow and Argyll and Clyde. The man in question had cancer, which I am glad to say was treated and cleared up, but, unfortunately, the treatment made him infertile. The man then sought the infertility treatment that would allow his family to grow, but Argyll and Clyde NHS Board said that it would not pay for the treatment and, worse than that, that it would not pay for the drugs. The family then found out that if they had lived a couple of miles up the road in the Glasgow area, Greater Glasgow NHS Board would have paid for the drugs, although it would not have paid for the infertility treatment. That is a cost of &#163;1,000 to patients in Argyll and Clyde that does not exist for those in Glasgow.</p><p>My third example is about methadone prescribing. Unfortunately, a boy died in the Barrhead area of East Renfrewshire because no tests were taken before he was prescribed methadone. The fatal accident inquiry has just been completed. If the boy had lived in Glasgow, tests would have been carried out; it would have been discovered that he did not have heroin in his system; he probably would not have been prescribed methadone, which was inappropriate; and the outcome would have been different. In fact, the boy had Valium in his system, which is potentially lethal when combined with methadone, as many members will be aware. That lack of testing means that, in certain areas, people can be prescribed methadone at the same time as they are taking drugs that should not be mixed with methadone.<place-holder colnum=\"6224\"/></p><p>In conclusion, the three examples that I have cited show the importance of co-operation among health boards and why we must end the inconsistent service delivery throughout Scotland. I hope that section 3 of the bill will end such problems, inconsistencies and discrepancies and that the bill is strong enough. If it is not, I hope that stage 2 amendments will be lodged to ensure that postcode prescribing and differences are ended and problems are sorted out.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13312299", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I assure Brian Monteith that this is not an unguarded comment: I completely and whole-heartedly welcome the abolition of the NHS trusts.

It is not my 10 <sup>th</sup> piece of legislation but my first, and I found some difficulty in getting my head round it at the start.</p><p>The reform of the High Court is a major piece of work and the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill is a major bill. It is critical that we get it right. If we make a mistake at this stage, that mistake will be with us for quite some time to come, so it is important that we get the basics right when making this change. I certainly welcome the general thrust and the general principles of the bill and its intended changes, but its success is dependent on all the different elements of the bill working together, as well as the measures that are not in the bill. Also, and most important of all, there must be a change in the general culture of all parties working in the system.<place-holder colnum=\"5969\"/></p><p>One of the most important aspects of the changes is early and full disclosure by the Crown to the defence. That is critical to the success of the bill, but it does not form part of the bill. Perhaps the Executive should reconsider its opposition to that matter and accept the committee's view that a provision should be inserted into the bill that would reflect Lord Bonomy's recommendations in that area. One specific problem relating to early disclosure is that of police witness statements, and that issue arose on several occasions. Lord Bonomy recommended that a working group be established to look into the issue, but the Executive has so far rejected that proposal.</p><p>That issue has been discussed for decades. As I understand it, the debate has been going on for some 25 years without any progress being made, so it is time that we came to a conclusion on the matter and made some progress. I believe that the best way forward is for a working party to be established with a tight remit and a short timetable for completing its work, as Lord Bonomy suggested. I urge the Executive to change its mind on that matter and implement that recommendation as soon as possible.</p><p>One of the other critical factors in changing to the new system is managed meetings. Managed meetings are one of the proposed reforms but, yet again, they do not form part of the bill. Managed meetings will allow the parties to discuss some of the outstanding matters and the outcomes of meetings will be recorded and produced to the court. Given the importance of the managed meetings and the fact that they will pave the way for the preliminary hearings and will assist in making those hearings a success, they must be mandatory and should, wherever possible, be face-to-face meetings rather than conducted by telephone or e-mail.</p><p>The introduction of preliminary hearings is probably the most crucial change to the current procedure and the one that could be of most benefit to the system. A series of benefits should flow from the hearings. Those will include clearing up any outstanding issues between the parties, such as relevancy and competency; dealing with special defences; dealing with some issues surrounding the admissibility of evidence; dealing with vulnerable witnesses; addressing the state of preparation of the parties; dealing with the availability of witnesses; getting early pleas, which are very important&#8212;if we get early pleas in a reasonable proportion of cases, that will make a big difference; and establishing fixed trial dates.</p><p>Preliminary hearings are the centrepiece of the bill and their introduction is almost universally welcomed. However, introducing preliminary hearings means that it is necessary to change the 110-day rule to 140 days. When we started <place-holder colnum=\"5970\"/> consideration of the bill my instinct was to oppose that change, as I was concerned about the possibility of prolonged incarceration of accused persons beyond 110 days. However, like some other members, I was unaware that the 110-day rule was a bit of a misnomer as in effect a trial could begin on the 114<sup>th</sup> day or, it seems to me, any other day beyond 110 days.</p><p>Bringing people to trial in as short a period as possible is central to our system of justice. After listening to the evidence, I am on balance persuaded that including the change to 140 days will not erode that principle. However, we need to monitor the situation closely to ensure that people are not being held for longer periods. A genuine concern is that there will be an upward drift in periods of incarceration. I accept the change to 140 days to gain the prize of the preliminary hearings, but we must ensure that that helps to speed up justice and does not slow it down.</p><p>On fixed trial dates, I certainly welcome the move away from sittings. However, there is concern that we may end up with the continuation of sittings by default if there is not a presumption of fixed trial dates. That concern was raised because of the possibility that there will be overuse of the provision that allows trials to be fixed from day to day&#8212;in other words, floating trials. I know that people do not like us to call them that, but trials that are being fixed from day to day seem to me to float. There must be a presumption in favour of genuinely fixed trial dates in the proposed new section 83A of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. I think that the Minister for Justice has already said that the Executive will consider the matter again. I certainly welcome that assurance.</p><p>I am concerned about the courts' ability to fix trial dates. It is clear that many people expected that an electronic diary would be the answer to the problem of co-ordinating diaries between all the different parties involved. However, the evidence that we received indicated that the electronic diary is at the development stage and is some distance away from being implemented.</p><p>I do not want to say a great deal about trials in the absence of the accused. I fully support the comments on that proposal in the report. There is little support for the proposal and I believe that it would not be in the interests of justice if it were implemented.</p><p>I do not believe that the tagging of reluctant witnesses is a measured response to a perceived problem. It treats potential witnesses in the same way as convicted persons who have been tagged as part of their sentence. I commend the evidence given to the committee by the witnesses from the University of Wolverhampton and in particular their comments on the provision of witness care <place-holder colnum=\"5971\"/> programmes. That would surely be a better way forward than tagging people.</p><p>On the issue of increasing the sentencing power of sheriffs, I am concerned&#8212;as are others&#8212;about the possibility of an upward sentencing drift in sheriff courts. I also share the concern of others about the removal of automatic representation by counsel for cases that are transferred to the sheriff courts from the High Courts. On the face of it, that seems to downgrade certain cases and to lead to a loss of rights for the accused persons. I ask the Executive to support what the committee has recommended in its stage 1 report.</p><p>The bill is a very important piece of work. It is a shame that we have only six minutes in which to speak. There are a lot of good recommendations in the committee's stage 1 report and I hope that the Executive will take them on board.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13311800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join fellow members of the Justice 1 Committee in thanking the witnesses who came along, the advisers and the clerks for helping all of us out in handling a complex piece of legislation.

Ethnic minorities feel targeted in New York by that method of policing and communities feel that they, instead of individual criminals, are being targeted. I have serious concerns about the zero-tolerance approach.</p><p>We could consider other examples from America and around the world. In Boston, the policing strategy is community led. The police department established a neighbourhood policing strategy in 1994. There are teams involving the clergy, trade union members, police officers and social workers. There is a city-wide anti-gang unit. If we are talking about community involvement, we should perhaps consider the Boston example rather than the New York example. More than 400 Bostonians were involved in the process. They created neighbourhood strategies and public safety <place-holder colnum=\"5538\"/> initiatives in their communities on issues that were important to them, not issues that were important to other people. The coalition produced a neighbourhood plan for policing&#8212;it was Boston's localised approach to cutting crime. Within two years, the number of homicides, or murders, was down by 39 per cent and the number of shootings was down by 28 per cent.</p><p>Local community involvement in policing has been effective in Boston, where neighbourhood policing is based on the development of partnerships between judges, religious leaders, business owners, teachers, young people, probation officers and the police. We should take the time to consider examples not only from Scotland but from around the world. We should not always go for headlines such as \"More police officers on the beat\" or \"Zero tolerance is the answer\". We should not just take the high-publicity headline approach of saying that zero tolerance is a quick fix; we should look at good examples from elsewhere. The Boston example of community involvement in local police forces is a good example that could fit the Scottish model much better than the New York example would.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13310552", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police Accountability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There are several ways&#8212;they can go through their councillor, they can go directly to the police board or they can do what was spoken about earlier.

What steps does the Executive intend to take to reach the figure of 3,000 additional teachers who will be required to achieve its goals? It is not clear how that figure will be achieved.

If not, how can the Executive justify its claim that the needs of pupils are central to the new curriculum? The General Teaching Council for Scotland has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A different element of training is required when it comes to being a secondary teacher&#8212;in behaviour management, curriculum and course content. The gulf is quite big there.\"</p><p>As Fiona Hyslop pointed out, David Eaglesham, who is the general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This proposal has nothing to do with education, it has to do with teacher shortages.

Reducing class sizes in those areas will certainly be very helpful. However, recent figures show the problems only too clearly.

However, 63 per cent of those children were referred because they needed care and protection; only 37 per cent were referred for allegedly committing an offence. In the past decade, referrals of children who have allegedly committed an offence have risen by 14 per cent. Undoubtedly, there is a rise in youth crime.</p><p>During the same period, referrals of children who have been victims of an offence have risen by 27 per cent. The number of children who were referred because of neglect or lack of parental care has risen by a shocking 247 per cent. There is no doubt that the lives of ordinary and decent people are being blighted by a small number of children who are committing offences. That is an outward manifestation of a truly appalling rise in the number of children who are in crisis.</p><p>A two-pronged approach is needed to deal with the situation. We must curb the activities of offenders. Curing the symptoms would improve the lot of many decent people, but if we are to cure the disease, we must also tackle the issue of youth protection. It is not enough to wait until a child offends and then issue the parents with a parental order, for example. We must invest money and resources in supporting families from the day that a child is conceived. All children deserve our support; they do not deserve to be regarded as a problem in our society. In a country with a declining population, such as ours, children are our most precious resource. We should nourish them, not demonise them.</p><p>Recently, I spoke to a group of young people from Dumbarton who expressed deep concern that they were being targeted and pilloried by the Executive; they felt picked upon.

There are, but in this country it is still the case that one is innocent until <place-holder colnum=\"4609\"/> proven guilty. The Executive's plans to introduce antisocial behaviour orders for under-16s will lead to the tagging of children, some as young as 10 years of age. Are we really striving to create the kind of society where a small child who is certainly in need of discipline, but who also needs protection, is criminalised and tagged?

They have already appeared as victims; later, they appear as offenders. That figure is an underestimate because many of the children who come to the children's hearings system as offenders have been maltreated and abused; however, that mistreatment has not been picked up and they have not been referred to the system before.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion commends the work carried out by local authorities, the voluntary sector and others in the area of youth justice and I join in applauding their efforts.

However, in that context I have to ask, \"Why the delay?\" Jim Wallace announced in October 2000 that he would set up a working group to analyse whether a community legal service for Scotland should be established. That was six months after the same service had been established in England and Wales. He published a report, \"Review of Legal Information and Advice Provision in Scotland\", on 26 November 2001. However, it was not until May 2002 that the Executive announced that it would set up three pilot schemes in Scotland.</p><p>Finally, three years after England and Wales established community legal services, we are now at the stage of debating many of the features of the pilot schemes. Surely, given the difficulties throughout the legal system, a far greater degree <place-holder colnum=\"3849\"/> of urgency was and is required from the Executive.</p><p>The first pilot Public Defence Solicitors Office was established on 1 October 1998. However, an independent assessment in 2001 showed that on most assumptions public defender and private sector costs were not significantly different. It also found that only 60 per cent of clients who used the public defender said that they would use the service again, whereas 83 per cent of private practitioners' clients said that they would use the private service again. Only 48 per cent of clients agreed strongly that the public defender had stood up for their rights, compared with 71 per cent of private practitioners' clients. Despite those concerns, the plan is to extend the scheme to both Glasgow and Inverness. Surely, if there are concerns about the system the priority should be to mend it before extending it. That is a critical issue. If fewer than half the clients who were questioned had complete confidence in their representation by public defenders, the matter must be addressed urgently.</p><p>I turn to the problems that are created because we do not have a legal system that consistently provides a service of a standard that meets the expectations and needs of clients. All members would agree that what we are after is not access to basic legal advice, information and representation, but access to high-quality legal advice, information and representation. I am concerned about the fact that the number of complaints that are made to the Law Society, the Faculty of Advocates and the ombudsman has continued to rise. Between 2001-02 and 2002-03, the number of complaints that were made to the ombudsman increased by 42 per cent. That followed a 66 per cent rise in the number of complaints in the previous year. In 2002, a total of 2,500 people complained to the Law Society.</p><p>The Scottish legal services ombudsman is quite right to point out that she is concerned about the length and complexity of the Law Society of Scotland's complaints procedure. In her annual report this year, there are examples of cases in which it took years of persistence to reach a conclusion and of files being apparently lost for years at a time. The number and complexity of the complaints give a broad overview of the problem. However, to understand the real impact on people, we have to look at individual cases. I shall highlight one case from this year's ombudsman's report, about a Mr G,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"who instructed solicitors to represent him at a High Court Trial ... He wrote to the Law Society to explain that for over a year after receiving a prison sentence he had tried to get the solicitors to appeal his case but they had never ... made an application. He changed solicitors\"</p><p>but his files were not passed on to his new solicitors. After some time, his original solicitors <place-holder colnum=\"3850\"/> said that they had lost the files. They eventually found them but decided not to send them as, in their opinion, the files</p><p class=\"indent\">\"cast no particular light on the matter ... The Law Society upheld two complaints ... but made no order or sanction\"</p><p>against the original solicitors. Their reason for not doing so was that the complainant</p><p class=\"indent\">\"had not suffered major adverse consequences\".</p><p>I am not sure what the Law Society considers adverse consequences, but most people would agree that his being in prison while his solicitors did not make an application for appeal, despite repeated requests, was a very serious adverse consequence.</p><p>The question of the level and quality of the service that is expected of the legal system is crucial in any debate about access. We must ensure that the result of any changes that we make to the legal system is that all the people of Scotland receive equal access to high-quality professional legal advice, information and representation.</p><p>I hope that the result of this debate is not just further reviews and pilot schemes, but that we begin to move forward, implementing the best practice from the pilot schemes and using the ideas that have been put forward and the comments that have been made in this debate and in previous debates&#8212;I understand that the matter has been debated several times over a number of years.

Appearing in court is a traumatic experience for everyone who appears as a witness in any case, regardless of whether they are vulnerable. It is therefore important that we put the measures in place to ensure that young and adult vulnerable witnesses are protected. However, I also appreciate that there is a difficult balance to be struck between the protection of vulnerable witnesses and the guarantee of a fair trial for the accused.</p><p>I will make a few side comments about the views of the Subordinate Legislation Committee, of which I am a member. I am pleased to report that the committee felt that the bill struck the right balance in relation to the powers that will be exercised through secondary legislation&#8212;statutory instruments&#8212;and primary legislation. It is not often the case that the Subordinate Legislation <place-holder colnum=\"3367\"/> Committee and the Executive agree on that point, but with this bill we do. However, there was some discussion in the committee about the fact that district courts are omitted, although I acknowledge that the power exists to extend the measures to other jurisdictions, in particular the district court. I hope that that will come in time.</p><p>Although I agree with the broad thrust of the bill, I have several points that I would like to be clarified. The bill states that a witness under 16 years of age is automatically entitled to benefit from special measures when they give evidence. We all know of 16-year-olds who have the emotional maturity of an 18-year-old or a 19-year-old&#8212;or perhaps someone older&#8212;but we also know of 17 and 18-year-olds who have the emotional maturity of a 14-year-old. Can the Executive guarantee that every effort will be made to ensure that vulnerable people such as those will be protected under the new legislation, because if they are over the age of 16 they will not have an automatic right to special measures?</p><p>I applaud the fact that any person with a mental disorder that affects their ability to give evidence is to be included as a vulnerable witness, but that right should be automatic for all adults with a mental disorder. If it is not to be an automatic right, what measures will be used to decide whether a witness's mental disorder affects their ability to give evidence? Why will some people suffering from a mental disorder not be given automatic entitlement to special measures? I am not convinced by the arguments put forward by the Executive and by the minister today on that point. Surely most, if not all, mental disorders will affect a witness's ability to give evidence to some degree. The Executive should re-examine that point.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13305174", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I support the thinking behind the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill.

I apologise if I did not make that clear. I accept that the scope is much wider. I accept that it is not just about mental disorder, and that it will apply to other groups of individuals, for example those who have suffered particularly traumatic attacks. However, there is still a case to be made for the automatic inclusion of people over the age of 16 who are suffering from mental disorder.</p><p>I am encouraged to see that the Justice 2 Committee supported the view of the Scottish Association for Mental Health that making evidence of a witness's mental disorder public <place-holder colnum=\"3368\"/> could be discouraging and stigmatising for the potential witness. I am pleased that the Executive has agreed to examine that issue and to produce further guidance in that area. However, I am unsure about how a vulnerable witness who suffers from a mental disorder will be protected from publicity arising from their entitlement to special measures, and I am concerned that that may breach a witness's right to confidentiality about their existing medical status. I hope that we all agree that all people, irrespective of their mental condition or any other matter, have a right to privacy concerning their medical status.</p><p>In its submission to the Justice 2 Committee, the Faculty of Advocates highlighted what may be the most difficult issue in the whole debate, which is the balance between the protection of the vulnerable witness and the right to a fair trial for the accused. Many members, such as Mike Pringle, Nicola Sturgeon, Annabel Goldie and others, have already spoken on that issue. It is a critical point. Under the bill, if special measures are used, the court has to weigh the perceived prejudice to a fair trial against the risk of prejudice to the interest of the child or other vulnerable witness, and then decide whether the significant risk to a fair trial outweighs the risk to the witness. The Faculty of Advocates asserted that, given those circumstances, the court would then be asked to legitimise a trial when it is already stated that there is a significant risk that the trial will be unfair. We must always bear that in mind. I accept that it is a difficult balance to strike&#8212;and I agree that in the bill the Executive has struck the right balance&#8212;but we must always be aware of the rights of the accused.</p><p>The Scottish Child Law Centre says that as long as the court is able to overturn an entitlement to special measures, it can be argued that the fairness of the trial will have been prejudiced. Would it not therefore be simpler and fairer to remove that provision from the bill, which would make it standard practice to give under-16s and other vulnerable witnesses their entitlement to special measures and would remove the danger of prejudicing a trial? In other words, the right should be made absolutely automatic.</p><p>When is an automatic right to special measures not automatic? When the court can decide to remove that right. If we agree, for instance, that witnesses who are under 16 are vulnerable and should have an automatic right to special measures, it is slightly strange to allow that right to be removed. I would like to hear what the Executive has to say on that.</p><p>I support fully the abolition of the competence test, which was an outmoded idea that often meant that evidence from children and other vulnerable witnesses was not even heard.

I join the many members who paid tribute to the previous Justice 1 Committee's work in producing the report. I was glad that so many members took the time to congratulate members of that committee on an impressive piece of work.</p><p>I am also glad to see that the Tory party&#8212;in the form of Bill Aitken&#8212;remains tied to the hang-'em-and-flog-'em solution. That might be the Tories' way of reducing prison numbers, but it is certainly not my way.</p><p>One of the committee's main recommendations, in relation to the appropriate use of short-term custodial sentences, was that community disposals should be actively promoted. If we accept that prison should do more than just punish and should be used proactively to rehabilitate offenders, and if we accept that short-term prison sentences offer limited opportunity for rehabilitation, we must accept the logic of the argument and recognise that custody is often the wrong option for people who are given short sentences. In light of that, it is particularly <place-holder colnum=\"3177\"/> disappointing that the prison population in Scotland is historically high and that 80 per cent of all custodial sentences are for periods of less than six months.</p><p>Prisoners who serve short-term sentences of between three and six months have the highest rates of return to custody. More than half return to custody within six months to two years, as I believe Christine Grahame pointed out earlier. The Executive has confirmed that it is disappointed with the figures and has concluded that the best way forward to achieve a more effective and integrated system would be to establish</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a single agency to deliver both custodial and non-custodial sentences in Scotland\".</p><p>I hope that the Executive's assumption is correct and that future sentencing policy will be more in line with the recommendations in the previous Justice 1 Committee's report.</p><p>The imprisonment of fine defaulters causes great concern. Many members&#8212;indeed, practically all who contributed to the debate&#8212;mentioned fine defaulters. I welcome the announcement about the two pilot projects, which will replace imprisonment for fine default by the mandatory use of supervised attendance orders in the areas that the projects cover. I agree with the minister that it is important that the use of such orders&#8212;at least in the pilot schemes&#8212;should be mandatory. If it is not, we might end up in the same position as we are in now, where the courts do not use the alternatives to custody that exist. When the pilot schemes end, we will be able to examine that.</p><p>However, the announcement raises some questions. In the statement on the Executive's website, there is no mention of any commitment to provide the resources that the pilot projects will require. I assume that resources will be made available on the ground and I hope that we receive clarification on that as soon as possible.</p><p>Many members talked about restorative justice. The committee endorsed the incorporation of</p><p class=\"indent\">\"restorative justice methods ... into community disposal programmes, wherever appropriate.\"</p><p>Johann Lamont, Pauline McNeill and others mentioned victims and it is important that we take into account not just the situation of those who commit crimes, but the effect on victims. The phrase \"wherever appropriate\" in that context is important and relevant. If a crime has a significant impact on identifiable victims, the restorative measures that put victims' interests at the heart of the criminal justice system must be an option at all stages of the process. The Executive's plan to introduce community reparation is to be welcomed as far as it goes, but I am not sure that it meets the committee's recommendation.<place-holder colnum=\"3178\"/></p><p>Many members raised the question of the information that is available to sentencers. It seems, certainly to those on the outside, that sentencers do not understand or are not aware of the complete range of options for alternatives to custody. If we are to provide a range of alternative sentencing options, we have to provide those who impose sentences in our courts with up-to-date and accurate information about what is available. The report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee welcomes the imminent publication of a directory of community disposals as a pilot in Lothian and Borders. The Committee recommends that the directory should be made available nationally ... The Committee also recommends that the directory should be electronic to ensure that it can be easily updated. It should contain information on the evaluation of local programmes as well as comprehensive information on the availability of programmes.\"</p><p>That issue was raised by several members, including Donald Gorrie. It is important that sentencers have to hand that list or directory&#8212;the word \"gazetteer\" was used&#8212;so that they can properly evaluate the possible alternatives to custody.</p><p>The Executive has agreed that the directory should be made available electronically and should include the kind of information that the committee requested. I welcome the Executive's response and I note that it is evaluating the pilot exercise that took place during the summer. I hope that the evaluation will not delay the introduction of the directory.</p><p>The committee believed that the sentencing information system that is in use in the High Court should be extended to sheriff courts, but the Executive remains to be convinced on that point. I agree with the Executive that a great deal of planning and work would have to go into extending the system, but that of itself should not be an obstacle to the introduction of any system that might improve the implementation of justice in Scotland. It has been said that the sentencing information system is not being used to the best effect in the High Court and it might be necessary to consider the matter further before any decision to extend the system is taken.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles that any plan to introduce alternatives to custody faces is the public's perception, about which Johann Lamont made a pertinent contribution. Any attempt to introduce community disposals on a wider scale without informing and educating the public could fail. It is essential that the public understand that any move towards community disposals is being taken to reduce reoffending and crime and to make people and communities safer. That is why I welcome the work carried out in November 2002 by the University of Strathclyde, which showed that the public are more supportive of community-<place-holder colnum=\"3179\"/> based options, services and programmes for offenders than was previously thought. Once the public are better informed about how community disposals operate, they will begin to support them and understand how they are the better option in many cases. The public realise that simply locking people up fails to address reoffending.</p><p>The question of resources runs through much of what has been said in the debate and much of what is contained in the report. That question is critical and is not just based on a never-ending demand for more. The issue is whether the resources that have been allocated match the resources that are required. The report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The majority of evidence received by the Committee demonstrated the requirement for more resources to be invested into community disposals in order to promote their greater use.\"</p><p>It is clear that the majority of the recommendations cannot be isolated from the overriding requirement for more resources to be invested. Hugh Henry stated today that the Executive is increasing the funding for criminal justice social work by &#163;44 million over five years. In evidence to the joint justice committees on the budget, social work representatives said that that funding was insufficient to meet the ever-increasing demands that are being placed on the criminal justice social work system. The Executive must acknowledge that there are genuine concerns among organisations working in the area that the resources provided do not match the resources required. There is a danger that resource availability will be patchy across the country.</p><p>The report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee has established that Scotland has a wide range of community penalties available, but that the prison population continues to rise. It is also clear that community disposals are at least as effective as short term imprisonment.\"</p><p>I hope that the Parliament agrees with that, although I accept what Pauline McNeill said in her opening remarks about the fact that we are not necessarily comparing like with like. We have to be careful about taking things at face value. It is important that we understand that there may be a difference between those who are given non-custodial sentences and those who are imprisoned.</p><p>I hope that we can all agree that the report is a comprehensive study into alternatives to custody. I congratulate the members of the previous Justice 1 Committee on carrying out an important piece of work and ask the Executive to consider the recommendations in the report seriously. I ask the chamber to support the motion, which I am happy to second.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13304740", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alternatives to Custody"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This afternoon's debate has been interesting and informative and we have heard many well-informed contributions from all parts of the chamber.

The debate is merely the beginning of a lengthy process that will take many months and many debates about the future of the fire service in Scotland.</p><p>As Margaret Smith said, I speak from a unique perspective in that, before I was elected to the Parliament, I was an employee of Strathclyde fire brigade for in excess of 10 years. In fact, when I gained my heavy goods vehicle licence, I sat my test in a fire engine. I have worn breathing apparatus in the live fire training unit at Strathclyde fire brigade's training centre. Although I am neither a qualified nor operational firefighter&#8212;I worked in the non-uniformed side of the service&#8212;I gained much insight into the operational activities of the fire brigade at full-time, retained and volunteer level.</p><p>I welcome many of the changes that are proposed in the consultation paper. Statutory recognition of the core duties that are outlined in the paper is long overdue. I welcome the statutory recognition of fire prevention, RTAs, responding to flooding&#8212;which, as Margaret Ewing said, is one of the major areas of work for fire brigades&#8212;and <place-holder colnum=\"2431\"/> enforcement. I am sure that the fire brigades will also welcome that.</p><p>I also welcome the proposal to introduce a common fire services agency. Like most things, the devil is in the detail. We will see what is meant by common services. However, there is no doubt that there is opportunity for debate and a more efficient service than exists in the eight brigades.</p><p>I welcome the proposed change to the disciplinary regulations. They are long overdue an overhaul. Members of the FBU might not agree with me on this point, but the disciplinary regulations are outdated, outmoded and an anachronism. It is time that we moved to modern personnel procedures for uniformed staff in the fire service.</p><p>I also welcome the change to integrated risk management. Risk management plans are the way forward, as standards of fire cover are slightly outdated. However, I must put a caveat on those remarks: to introduce integrated risk management nationwide without piloting the project and ensuring that it works would be a mistake. Moreover, to introduce integrated risk management without national minimum standards would be a dreadful mistake. I see nowhere in the consultation paper the preservation of national standards, which we have at the moment. I am not talking only about the generality of the A, B, C and D-risk areas, but about pre-determined attendance times and crew levels. There is no doubt that certain senior officers in the fire brigades wish a reduction from crews of five, five and two on the two pumps and the special to five, four and two and even down to four, four and two. Frankly, it is unacceptable to have only four crew members on the first appliance to turn up at an incident. Nobody in an operational station would agree with that idea.</p><p>So far, no member has discussed the fact that the private finance initiative is mentioned in the consultation paper. Perhaps I was overly optimistic in thinking that the Executive would have learnt its lesson on the terrible disaster that PFI brings to the public sector. The mess that the Edinburgh royal infirmary PFI is in, for example, is clear. To introduce PFI to privatise parts of the fire service would be a terrible and dreadful mistake. The Executive has put forward proposals for the Highlands and Islands fire brigade, and I think that the amount of money involved is &#163;300,000, which was to encourage the brigade to go down the privatisation route by privatising fire stations. That is unacceptable to me, and I am sure that my colleagues agree that we would not support such a move.</p><p>I wish to discuss one particular area of&#8212;let us say&#8212;dispute. In January this year, there was a proposal to repeal the provisions under section 19 <place-holder colnum=\"2432\"/> of the Fire Services Act 1947 through an amendment to the Local Government in Scotland Bill at stage 3. The amendment was voted down for a number of reasons. The idea that the safety net of section 19 provisions might be removed is unacceptable.

If they are going to launch something that is labelled a national theatre, the worst possible thing is to do it half-heartedly.\"</p><p>I am sure that we would all agree that it is essential that the national theatre is based on a secure foundation. That means that Scotland needs a secure regional theatre structure with secure funding in place. I know that, over the past few years, a lot of money has gone into regional theatre to try to create that stability, but we need it for the future as well. In 2002, Liz Lochhead made a similar point:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If the Scottish Theatre was to be a cosmetic crown upon a rotten tooth underneath that would be a terrible thing\".</p><p>I hope that the minister accepts that there are genuine worries about the future funding of the theatre and about what happens when the next crisis occurs. Will the money allocated to the national theatre be used once again to pay for the regional theatres? Perhaps the minister will enlighten us on that point.</p><p>I understand that it has been announced that the funding for the national theatre has been allocated from end-year flexibility. What will happen in a year in which no such flexibility is available? What <place-holder colnum=\"2149\"/> will happen to the Scottish national theatre, or indeed the regional theatres, when the Treasury in London decides to cut the money. That brings us to one of the central problems. No matter what we do, without financial autonomy the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government will always be dependent on what the London Treasury decides. Labour members might not like it, but any cuts in the block grant will mean that the Scottish Government will need to cut services. We have seen in the recent past how the first cut was to the plans for the national theatre. What is the likelihood that the same thing will not happen again? What promises for future funding are in place? Where is the future stability of funding that the national theatre needs? What is the long-term plan to put the funding of the regional theatres on a stable footing? I hope that we will get some answers when the minister responds at the end of the debate.</p><p>Small independent European countries allocate much more public money to the provision of theatre than is provided in Scotland. Does anyone really say that because those countries fund theatre, they are unable to provide an adequate health service? Of course not. The Government has often said that we cannot have both, but members of the arts world would disagree. As Roseanna Cunningham said when she quoted Iain Reekie, who is head of drama and performance at Queen Margaret University College, the argument that if we fund a theatre we cannot fund a hospital bed is daft. It is no long-term solution to the funding of the arts in Scotland to have a policy that is based on robbing Peter to pay Paul. The arts in Scotland, including the national theatre and the regional theatres, need to be adequately funded. They need stability in their future funding in order to plan ahead.</p><p>The artistic community has spoken out loudly about that lack of stable and adequate funding. I quote again from Liz Lochhead, who said earlier this year:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Citizens is in a terrible state, but to make matters worse, proportionately they get more money than many other theatres\".</p><p>Mark Thomson, who is the artistic director of the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company, said that the funding shortage</p><p class=\"indent\">\"poses a serious threat to the standards and quality of theatre\".</p><p>Those matters need to be addressed.</p><p>I will finish with one further quote, which comes from James Boyle of the Scottish Arts Council:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Let's have a national theatre and let's have the full funding stream. The arts will repay the country in full measure.\"</p><p>I whole-heartedly agree with James Boyle on that <place-holder colnum=\"2150\"/> point. The real question is whether the Government agrees with him.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13302231", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish National Theatre"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like many other members, I welcome the Executive's commitment to create a national theatre for Scotland.

Obviously, the problem is not only the fact of crime but perceptions of crime.</p><p>The substantive issue of early release, which is referred to in the Tory motion, cannot be dealt with in isolation. That is why the Scottish National Party agrees with allowing the sentencing commission to do its job. Hugh Henry, Michael Matheson, Margaret Smith and many other members commented on that. We must give the commission the independence and the time to come up with proposals that we can debate at a future point.</p><p>If we did as the Tories suggest and suddenly stopped the automatic early release of prisoners without dealing with the overcrowding in our prisons, our overstretched system would collapse. Again, that point was made by many members, including Michael Matheson, Hugh Henry and Margaret Smith. We must deal with the issue of early release in the round and not in isolation. If we are serious, we will consider the number of people who are sent to prison in the first place, especially those who are imprisoned for minor offences such as the non-payment of fines. That is the way to go, rather than simply getting rid of automatic early release.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell talked about fines and fine defaulters. However, I agree with what Michael Matheson said about unit fines. Many countries throughout Europe use unit fines, which would be an effective way of dealing with the problem of the non-payment of fines. Statistics show that a high proportion of female prisoners are in prison for fine defaulting. Surely there is a fairer, more constructive way of dealing with that offence.</p><p>I agree with other members that there must be a way of ensuring that when offenders are released <place-holder colnum=\"2090\"/> back into society they are ready to play a useful part in society. That is why there must be an increase in the number of programmes within prisons to help rehabilitate offenders prior to their release. Margaret Smith, Karen Whitefield and Alex Neil made good points on that issue. Our aim must be to reduce the current high incidence of recidivist behaviour. Public confidence in the justice system would be much higher if we achieved serious reductions in the number of released prisoners who reoffend.</p><p>Some of the most important points raised in the debate were around ideas on alternatives to custody. Again, Margaret Smith, Margaret Mitchell and Pauline McNeill made excellent points on that subject. We must take a serious look at all the ideas in that area, including the suggestion of weekend sentencing. We must also ensure that we consider the best and most successful examples of alternatives to custody from around the world. It is not good enough only to say that we have more police and that we have spent more money. That in itself will not do anything. We must match resources to the demands of the system. Saying that there are more resources does not mean that they match the system's needs. That is clearly shown by the increase in cases that end in no proceedings from 12.5 per cent in 1997 to 17 per cent in 2002-3.</p><p>I pay tribute to Colin Fox's comments on children's panels. I agree that the Tory leader was utterly wrong in his comments about panels. Margaret Smith's comments about her personal experience of the justice system were helpful. Personal experience brings a light to the subject that is often missing from our speeches. It is important that we take the personal experience of individuals into account when we deal with the justice system.</p><p>I hope that the SNP amendment to the motion will be supported, as it tackles the idea that we must match resources to the demands within the system.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13302016", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been interesting and many good points have been made from all parts of the chamber.

Unfortunately, I was detained on constituency business. I know that some members have been concerned about that matter, so I want to make it clear that I would obviously have preferred to have been here but for that rather unfortunate coincidence.</p><p>I start by focusing on cancer, which is widely acknowledged as Scotland's biggest killer. I welcome the Executive's proposed target of reducing cancer-related deaths among people under the age of 75 by 20 per cent by 2010. However, if we want to reduce cancer, the first thing that we should do is join the ever-growing list of countries that have introduced anti-smoking legislation. In 1988, California introduced such legislation and subsequently found that cancer incidence rates declined by 10 per cent in the following decade. More important, cancer mortality rates declined by an impressive 14 per cent over the same period.</p><p>Surely those figures show that one of the most important steps that Scotland could take to rise to the challenge of improving Scotland's health would be to introduce similar anti-smoking legislation here&#8212;the sooner, the better. Legislating on smoking would send out a clear and unambiguous message to the Scottish people about how seriously we approach the issue of smoking and the ill health and death that it brings to many of our fellow Scots.</p><p>We all know about the more obvious problems that are associated with smoking, but smoking during pregnancy is one of the leading factors in incidences of low birth weight. Other reasons for low birth weight include poor nutrition, excessive drinking while pregnant and, obviously, socioeconomic deprivation. However, when health is being discussed, the issue of low birth weight is often overlooked&#8212;both the cause of it and the consequences that flow from it.</p><p>Low birth weight is strongly socially patterned. In Scotland, the number of full-term babies who are born with low birth weight is virtually unchanged over the past decade. Full-term babies born to the most deprived parents are twice as likely to be of low birth weight as those born to parents in the least deprived category.<place-holder colnum=\"1916\"/></p><p>Low birth weight is not a problem of just being underweight at birth and catching up later on; it can be indicative of many health problems for the individual in future years. Babies of low birth weight suffer poor health in the first four weeks of life in particular and have a higher risk of death before attaining their second birthday. They risk delayed physical and intellectual development, both in childhood and in adolescence. They are more likely than average-weight babies to have some form of disability. Low birth weight is also a significant risk factor for developing asthma and there is now some evidence to suggest that low birth weight increases the risk of heart disease in later life.</p><p>Women's health and maternity services in the widest sense need to be a crucial part of any health strategy, particularly in areas of deprivation. That is why it is such a retrograde step to deny the people of Inverclyde, Dumbarton and Argyll a complete consultant-led maternity service. I know that the issue has been raised by other members, including Duncan McNeil, who raised the issue of the Rankin hospital this morning. The closure of the Vale of Leven maternity unit along with its urology and accident and emergency units is nothing more than death by a thousand cuts. The people of Inverclyde also face the loss of their maternity services because of the closure of the Rankin hospital, as has been mentioned. The maternity services are to be centralised in Paisley.</p><p>Tackling many of our health problems means making health facilities available locally, not closing them down. Glasgow is about to see the closure of the Victoria infirmary, which is to be replaced by a stand-alone ambulatory care and diagnostic unit. Stobhill is to be downgraded, with the loss of acute in-patient services. In addition, Glasgow will lose three of its five accident and emergency units. All those cuts are taking place against the wishes of the people of Glasgow. Mention was made earlier of the need to talk to people and consult them about health services. That is an admirable aim, but it is no good talking to the people if we do not listen to what they say. I have yet to speak to one person who thinks that the proposals for Glasgow are the best option for patients or their loved ones.</p><p>If the Scottish Government is serious about rising to the challenge of improving Scotland's health, it must tackle the causes of ill health and not just the symptoms. First and foremost, that means tackling smoking. If we did what California, New South Wales and New Zealand have done, and what Norway and Ireland are about to do, we would see the same health benefits, not just in relation to cancer rates, but for other smoking-related illnesses. It is not just about smoking; we also have to deal with poor diet.

Speedy diagnosis is obviously needed. There must be no delay&#8212;not some delay; no delay&#8212;in treating people who have cancer. It is essential that we do all that we can, but if we do not tackle the root causes of cancer, we will fail people. Therefore, we must tackle the major cause of cancer in Scotland, which is smoking. In most years in Scotland, 24,000 to 25,000 people are diagnosed with cancer. Of those people, approximately 8,000 will die as a result of smoking. The best investment in cancer services would be to ban smoking. There is no doubt that smoking causes cancer. It is an established fact that between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of all lung cancer cases are caused by smoking. Moreover, almost a quarter of all cancer deaths are from lung cancer.</p><p>Lung cancer is not the only cancer that is caused by smoking. Other cancers that are caused by smoking include cancer of the larynx, pharynx, oesophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, nasal cavities, nasal sinuses, stomach and liver. The truth is that smoking causes around a third of all cancer deaths.</p><p>Smokers are not the only people to fall victim to cancer from smoke&#8212;non-smokers suffer, too. Tobacco smoke contains 4,000 chemicals, including tar, benzene, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide. It contains 60 known or suspected carcinogens and has been classified as a class A carcinogen in the United States alongside substances such as asbestos and arsenic. We legislate to protect workers from such substances, so why do we not legislate to protect them from tobacco smoke?</p><p>In 1998, the United Kingdom Government's independent Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health published a report, which concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of lung cancer and, in those with long term exposure, the increased risk is in the order of 20-30%.\"</p><p>Countries such as Ireland, Norway, New Zealand, Canada and the United States have recognised the dangers of passive smoking, understood the severity of the problem and dealt with it by banning smoking in certain circumstances. Paradoxically, Scotland, which has some of the highest rates of smoking-related deaths and illness in the world, still has no legislation in place that provides safe, smoke-free environments for its citizens. California introduced anti-smoking legislation in 1988. Between 1988 and 1996, the <place-holder colnum=\"1458\"/> incidence of cancer there declined by 7 per cent. Over the same period, cancer mortality rates declined by 13 per cent and smoking rates declined. The evidence from places where smoking has been banned is clear: banning smoking saves lives.</p><p>Like many members who are in the chamber today, last night I attended the launch of the Scottish cancer coalition. The coalition's manifesto contains a call for action. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We call on the Scottish Executive to take urgent action to ban smoking in all work places and all public places.\"</p><p>Does the Executive support the 14 groups that make up the Scottish cancer coalition and have made that call, or will it oppose legislation to regulate smoking?</p><p>Members will be aware that I have proposed a bill that seeks to regulate smoking. In response to that proposal, the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We would strongly support such legislation.

I accept that the High Court deals with more complex cases than does the sheriff court, but the conclusion that should be drawn is surely that the resources are inadequate, not that the 110-day rule is wrong. It would set a dangerous precedent if we were to decide to change a rule because it is being broken. Using the same logic, we could eliminate speeding by changing the speed limit to 150mph&#8212;the problem would appear to be solved. Instead, we need to examine why the rule is being broken, decide whether the rule has any merit&#8212;I believe that it does&#8212;and try to find ways to alleviate the problem so that the rule is not broken in the future.</p><p>The 110-day rule forms a central part of our system of justice by ensuring that both the accused and the victim are not kept in limbo for an unacceptably long time. The concern that prosecutions take too long to carry out their work, with the consequence that defences have insufficient time to prepare their cases, leads me to the conclusion that the Crown Office requires additional resources, not that the 110-day rule is wrong.</p><p>SACRO has stated that it believes:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that there is a sincere genuineness on behalf of the PF department to work with us but due to inadequate staffing levels, the case turnaround is nowhere near as quick as it should be.\"</p><p>The problem is not that 110 days is too short, but that the Executive has failed to put sufficient resources into the service, which would allow the prosecution to deal with its work load speedily and therefore allow the defence enough time to prepare its case within the current time limit. I am not convinced of either the need or the desirability of extending the 110-day period.</p><p>However, I welcome the proposal to increase the sentencing power of sheriff courts from three to five years, which will lead inevitably to an increase in their work load. The estimated 20 per cent reduction in the work load of the High Court that will result from the change is welcome, but the sheriff courts will see their work load increase by an estimated 7 per cent. It seems odd that the Executive should wish to push ahead with the change before completion of the review of the summary justice system. It would be much more sensible if the Executive were to await the outcome of that inquiry before proceeding.</p><p>Concerns already exist about the current situation in sheriff courts, where there is increasing difficulty in finding new recruits as defence <place-holder colnum=\"1069\"/> solicitors in the legal aid system. Does the Executive believe that increases in the work load and in the complexity and seriousness of the cases that are dealt with by those who work in the sheriff courts, without an increase in the resources that are available, will result in an improvement in the service? The fact that the legal aid rates that are payable to defence solicitors have not changed in 11 years needs urgently to be addressed. I hope that the minister will respond to that in his summing up.</p><p>Colin Fox and Annabel Goldie made an important point. Are we saying that, if the 110-day rule fails, we will change the period to 140 days and that if a 140-day rule fails, will we change the period to 170 days? If a 170-day rule fails, where will we go from there?

In particular, I want to pay tribute to the trained volunteers whom Sarah Boyack mentioned, who give their time to help others through their work with the CABx.</p><p>During the election campaign, I was fortunate <place-holder colnum=\"628\"/> enough to visit East Renfrewshire citizens advice bureau in Barrhead, where and I spent a lot of time talking to volunteers and members of staff. I want to support the motion and to highlight some issues from East Renfrewshire, where I live.</p><p>In the past year, East Renfrewshire CAB dealt with 6,802 cases, of which 27 per cent&#8212;1,836&#8212;were debt related. That might seem to be an astonishing work load for an area that is perceived to be one of the most affluent areas in Scotland, but the reality is often very different from the perception. That is certainly true in this case. Although 19 per cent of those who approached East Renfrewshire CAB were unemployed, 21 per cent were fully employed, 12 per cent were partly employed and 3.5 per cent were self-employed. Debt does not affect only those who find themselves out of work.</p><p>Although 21 per cent of East Renfrewshire CAB's clients were local authority tenants and 12 per cent were housing association tenants, 30 per cent were home owners. Those figures make it clear that debt problems affect all sectors of society&#8212;although I accept Sarah Boyack's point that the deep relationship between debt and ingrained poverty is the main problem.</p><p>The East Renfrewshire CAB money advice service provides services such as debt counselling, income maximisation, negotiation with creditors and representation for members of the public. On the face of it, it seems that East Renfrewshire CAB fits exactly into the Executive's thinking as given in the partnership agreement and as reiterated by the motion's commitment</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to support the extension of the money advice service\".</p><p>Unfortunately, however, there has been a bit of problem in East Renfrewshire in the past few years. The Executive assigned East Renfrewshire Council &#163;40,000 so that it could develop money advice. The CAB applied for half of that money but got nothing. Instead, the &#163;40,000 went to a council department, which used the money to employ a money advisor and an administrative worker, leaving the CAB to struggle on with the four voluntary workers that it had on its books. It is outrageous that the council kept that money and did not give some of it to the CAB so that it could use its expertise to give people independent advice and representation. People have debts for many different reasons including the poll tax, council tax and rent arrears, and some people are threatened with eviction. The pursuer of all such debts is the council, so it is not appropriate that the council should directly employ the staff who go on to represent people who are in conflict with the council. We need independent advice that is given through CABx.</p><p>There is another problem in that under section <place-holder colnum=\"629\"/> 187 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, certain benefits are inalienable, although banks often freeze accounts that contain tax credits. The CAB must then have those bank accounts unfrozen. Therefore, if the Department for Work and Pensions pursues the initiative to pay more benefits into bank accounts, that might become more of a problem. I ask the minister and the Executive to be aware of that problem and to try to tackle it through getting all interested parties together to sort out the problem so that, in future, people do not experience frozen bank accounts.</p>", "hdate": "2003-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13298070", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Credit Schemes"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Sarah Boyack for securing such an important debate.

The West of Scotland is a very diverse region. Geographically, it ranges from Eastwood on the border of Glasgow down to the Clyde coast. It covers both sides of the River Clyde, from Strathkelvin up to Argyll. It is also very diverse economically and socially. In the next four years, I hope to represent all the people of the West of Scotland equally.</p><p>I welcome many of the Executive's proposals for local government, particularly the proposal to reform the voting system for local government elections from the first-past-the-post system to the single transferable vote system. However, I remain unconvinced that the Executive will fulfil that promise. I believe that my suspicions are well founded, because four years ago the Lib Dems went into office with the promise of electoral reform. After four years, there was absolutely <place-holder colnum=\"209\"/> nothing&#8212;certainly no reform. We have had reports, inquiries, consultations, a draft bill and plenty of kicking the issue into the long grass, but no reform. We have even had the spectacle of the Liberals voting against the introduction of STVPR, when they voted against Tricia Marwick's Proportional Representation (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Bill in the previous session.</p><p>This time the partnership agreement states that we are to have STV. However, it also states that multimember wards will have either three or four members&#8212;there will be complete inflexibility. Where did that come from? It did not come from the McIntosh or Kerley reports&#8212;Kerley recommended that there should be up to five councillors per ward. The idea did not come from Tricia Marwick's member's bill, which contained complete flexibility and would have allowed for a maximum of eight councillors per ward. It certainly did not come from any of the submissions to the consultations that have taken place on this issue.</p><p>So where did it come from? As Sherlock Holmes famously said:</p><p>\"When you have eliminated the impossible, that which remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"</p><p>In this case, we are left with the truth that the only reason for choosing to have three or four members per ward is to save the jobs of as many Labour councillors as possible.</p><p>This week we have had the unedifying sight of Labour MPs and councillors uniting in an attempt to block the introduction of a fair voting system. Scottish Labour MPs have the temerity to state that they will take revenge on the Parliament if we introduce fair voting for councils. All they have proved with their comments is how antidemocratic they are and why it is vital that the Parliament takes control of its affairs.</p><p>This is the not the first time that the attempted manipulation of the voting system to favour one party unfairly or to discriminate against other parties has been tried. In the context of what is contained in the partnership document, what De Valera did in Ireland may sound very familiar. De Valera increased the total number of three-member wards by 47 per cent&#8212;a move that favoured Fianna F&#225;il over other parties. As one commentator wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"constituency revision achieved its purpose.\"</p><p>In his biography of De Valera, Coogan states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It was a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no Six County Unionist could have bettered.\"</p><p>The attempt by Labour and the Liberals to gerrymander the vote must be stopped. I support STVPR, but not STV without PR. The Liberals have stated that PR is one of their core principles, but they are willing to sacrifice PR by supporting <place-holder colnum=\"210\"/> the reduction in the number of members per ward to a point where proportionality barely applies.</p><p>For me, proportional representation is not an abstract concept. It is about fairness and is supposed to be about democracy. This is a golden opportunity for us to introduce a fair voting system and to allow a democratic renewal of local government to take place. We must not let that opportunity slip away by succeeding in introducing the single transferable vote system but failing to introduce proportional representation.</p>", "hdate": "2003-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13296889", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by thanking the people of the West of Scotland, who have given me the opportunity to represent them over the next four years.
