In this debate, we have collectively demonstrated the need to express that difference in the name of our children.</p><p>In 1997, Nelson Mandela said:</p><p>&#8220;There can be no keener revelation of a society&#8217;s soul than the way in which it treats its children.&#8221;</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate has exemplified, in the face of what was a very challenging inquiry, as John Wilson said, what that means for us and the society that we wish to reflect in Scotland.</p><p>I acknowledge, as the convener did, all those who participated in the inquiry, and particularly Barnardo&#8217;s for bringing the petition to us.</p><p>The report is comprehensive, but before I address it, I congratulate all the participants in the debate. It is salutary to consider some of the words and phrases that have been used, such as &#8220;neglect&#8221;, &#8220;revulsion&#8221;, &#8220;disjointed&#8221;, &#8220;trust&#8221;, &#8220;lack of co-ordination&#8221; and &#8220;gaps&#8221; in communication. In particular, Jayne Baxter&#8217;s and Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s contributions are to be commended.</p><p>In the inquiry, we talked about not just cause and effect but the need for action above all. In many ways, the report considers the effects and recommendations to mitigate the effects, which I will come to, but the cause is just as important, and I would like to consider it first. I will therefore start, perversely, with part 5 of the report and how we can disrupt, prosecute and severely penalise the perpetrators. What I have to say must have some bearing&#8212;as I am sure it will&#8212;on the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>As Angus MacDonald said, Daljeet Dagon of Barnardo&#8217;s explained that she had</p><p>&#8220;talked about the triangle approach that Barnardo&#8217;s developed, whereby the focus is on the victim but there is also recognition that there is a child sex offender and a facilitator. We have to flip the triangle over and focus on disrupting and prosecuting perpetrators, and we should identify locations&#8221;</p><p>where they will operate</p><p>&#8220;and police them better&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Public Petitions Committee, 11 June 2013; c 1434.]</p><p>That is not just for the police; it is also for the third sector agencies and families, as has been mentioned.</p><p>Police Scotland said that the wider community was pivotal in recognising and reporting CSE, but it was asked why the Protection of Children and Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005 had not been used effectively, if at all. It is not acceptable that, if that act was to give new tools and powers to the police, freedom of information requests in 2012 found that, between them, Lothian and Borders Police and Strathclyde Police had issued only two RSHOs. The same applied to the sexual offence prevention orders. Only 1.05 per cent of offenders on the sex offenders register had SOPOs applied. I welcome Police Scotland&#8217;s commitment to secure additional mandatory training and highlight all the legislative options that are open to it, and its optimism&#8212;which, I am sure, is not misplaced&#8212;that the single service will ensure that Scotland has a wider approach to ensuring that victims are protected.</p><p>It is not just down to the police, of course; as I said, it is down to a multi-agency approach. That said, several, if not many, organisations, including the ministerial short-life working group, the national working group for sexually exploited children, the Office of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner in the inquiry into CSE in gangs and groups, CEOP and the NSPCC, have assessed and reported on the effects of, and the leading up to, child sexual exploitation.</p><p>Of course, as I said, running in parallel with the committee&#8217;s inquiry and report was consideration of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill, so it would be wrong to suggest that nothing is happening. Something is happening. For example, Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland has stated that it has</p><p>&#8220;established a partnership ... with Renfrewshire Council and the local police to better protect children who go missing, with a particular focus on CSE.&#8221;</p><p>In addition, the Glasgow child protection committee has taken a multi-agency approach to investigating CSE. However, it is too disparate and inconsistent, and is frankly not as joined up as we might wish, as John Wilson pointed out.</p><p>Despite there being many examples of good practice across Scotland, the response is patchy and the various demands to address the support needs of children in a co-ordinated way were questioned by the committee. On addressing children&#8217;s needs and vulnerabilities, the training of those who are involved in detecting children targeted for CSE, supporting children who have experienced CSE, and disrupting and capturing actual and would-be perpetrators, the committee believed that all those areas were inadequately co-ordinated.</p><p>That is why the report suggests that there should in fact be, as has been mentioned, a national strategy for tackling child sexual exploitation. That should include an organisation to co-ordinate a national approach to tackling and preventing the enemy within that is CSE, and to support the victims. The committee noted that the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill was imminent and it suggested that the serious issue of CSE should be considered as part of the scrutiny of the bill, or at least considered in tandem with that scrutiny.</p><p>A feature of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill is the requirement for a named person to consider a child&#8217;s interests. Within the committee&#8217;s proposal for a national framework, we suggest that the Government establish as soon as possible that a named person or overarching organisation be made directly responsible for the accelerated co-ordination and implementation of the process and the communication links to not reduce but eradicate the scourge of CSE from our communities.</p><p>However, for any strategy or organisation to be successful it must understand what the problem is and how it is defined. Of course, it is contiguous with sexual abuse, but it has a particular black form with the attendant material seductions. The basis of any successful tactical operation that flows from the strategy must be a composite of the key elements that the committee considered for the proposed organisation and the critical factors in the recommendations.</p><p>I wish that I could say that I was delighted to participate in the inquiry, but delighted is the wrong word; it would be much more appropriate to say that the inquiry was harrowing. The inquiry could have done and dug so much more if it had had more time. The Government has accepted the committee&#8217;s proposal to develop a framework, but the proposal for a co-operative organisation with clear responsibilities, required outcomes and a data mechanism to scope the challenge will be, on acceptance, a huge step forward. I welcome the proposed national plan.</p><p>I started with a quotation from Nelson Mandela and, if I may, I will finish with another. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Our children are our greatest treasure. They are our future. Those who abuse them tear at the fabric of our society and weaken our nation.&#8221;</p><p>Hopefully, the Public Petitions Committee&#8217;s report will go some way towards making sure that that does not happen.</p><p>We ignore the report at our peril. It is significant and the recommendations are highly significant. If they are not attended to, CSE will eat away at our social fabric and the social relationships therein. I would ask, I would encourage and I would plead that all members read the detail of the report&#8212;every word and recommendation&#8212;and understand what it means for our children and our society.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22865865", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I believe that we all come to the Parliament, sometimes amid rhetoric and cosmetics, to try to make a difference&#8212;however big or small&#8212;to our fellow citizens.

The life that breathed the singing and the painting of Scots words, great music and national ambition and aspiration sadly breathed its last in Dumfries in July 1796. Burns was buried initially, as was mentioned, in a far corner of St Michael&#8217;s church; he was then moved to his final location in the Burns mausoleum in 1815.</p><p>He was posthumously given the freedom of the town of Dumfries, in which burgh he had already been given recognition in 1787. Who knows: perhaps his life will be celebrated not only by those who come from all the pairts&#8212;internationally, from all over the world&#8212;to Dumfries this weekend, but perhaps by some of his 600 descendants, some of whom will probably not even know that they are descended from his 12 children.</p><p>I sit on the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and the director of homecoming Scotland recently presented to us a whole array of exciting events that will take place in Scotland this year.

It places a stake in the ground. That does not mean that a strangulation of environmental protection is necessary&#8212;far from it.

I propose that in the hope that there is no naivety in the statement that, given the Government&#8217;s commitment to ensuring that communities and consumers will be involved in deliberations on the future application of the bill through the code of practice, the bill will be seen in that light and not as an amber light for those who would traduce its principles as they skip along to the nearest tribunal or court.</p><p>The bill is a three-legged stool. First, it encourages consistency of application while contributing to sustainable economic growth. Secondly, it develops and enhances environmental regulatory powers.

As the former UK finance director of a very large global company, I was charged with achieving an acceptable expense to revenue ratio related to the company&#8217;s policies in the risk assessment and market framework in which we operated. During the 1992 recession, I was asked to reduce that percentage of the budget by 2 per cent, which meant a reduction of &#163;2.2&#160;million on revenues of &#163;100&#160;million, which is nothing like what the cabinet secretary is confronted with every day. We had the luxury of choice. We could either increase revenues or cut costs. This Government and the cabinet secretary do not have the luxury of increasing their income element, nor is there a lot of scope for increasing other revenue streams.</p><p>That means prioritising spending within that financial planning or market framework to secure economic progress on the back of capital asset improvement and structural and social employment changes. With all good intent, I say to the Opposition&#8212;indeed, I say it to us all&#8212;there is nothing wrong with wishing to prioritise extra spending in certain areas but we should be flexible. We have an obligation or duty to see how and where we can cut to meet the new spending policies and priorities, wherever they come from within the chamber.</p><p>The fundamentals of every budget seek to establish an economic growth pattern that embraces long-term growth while providing parallel sustainability of human and environmental development. In securing those objectives, the focus on continued infrastructure and asset investment as keys to the future efficiency of the economy is welcome, and I noted the comments on that in the Finance Committee&#8217;s report. The aggregate spending of capital in the budget, enhanced by the various supplements to capital, giving a spend of &#163;4&#160;billion on infrastructure, is within all the policy frameworks that we wish to achieve by creating a springboard for future employment and efficiency.</p><p>As a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, I want to look at a few of the considerations in our review of the budget that are related to the national performance framework. There is little doubt that proper scrutiny of increased productivity and demand, under a tight discipline of, for example, public procurement supported by European directives on procurement and the unleashing of productivity and innovation via the proposed community empowerment bill, will see a greater level of economic activity. That is, of course, part of the NPF&#8217;s policy driver.</p><p>The marginal reduction as a result of the regrettable top-line Barnett cuts in the enterprise agencies and the retention of social enterprise and third sector funding provides Scotland with greater impetus to make the social and structural change to continue to find, develop and grow innovative companies that have high growth potential. Within that, we need to increase the role of women and ethnic minorities. A number of account-managed, high-growth companies will achieve their potential, as will the sustained growth of social enterprise&#8212;again, part of the wider policy framework.</p><p>I will finish by talking about a specific area that I believe is fundamental to the success of every profound and, in this case, supportable budget, and I relate it to what I consider to be a key driver in achieving our policy and financial objectives. In that regard, I return to my opening comments on the budget. We are trying to create a fairer system with a fairer pay regime in the public sector, to start to demolish the genie effect of the gap in remuneration between the lower paid in our society and those at the top of public sector pay scales, for example. I welcome our commitment to establishing a minimum basic pay increase and to starting to secure the payment of a Scottish living wage for all who deal with the public sector. I believe that that is a fundamental change, which will secure Scotland&#8217;s increased performance.</p><p>In the current environment and against a backdrop of what some of us think is a nonsensical financial relationship between controlled expenditure in this place and non-controlled income&#8212;control over which is exercised elsewhere&#8212;I applaud the Finance Committee on the thorough financial analysis in its recommendations on the budget and the wider planning framework.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I rise to support the commendable Finance Committee report on the draft budget and its recommendations to the Scottish Government, particularly on its outcome-based approach in its conclusion.

In 1921, there were 100,000 shipbuilding jobs in Scotland. In 1955, the figure was almost 100,000. In 1998&#8212;there was no SNP Government yet&#8212;the figure was 10,100. That was pure decimation. In 2011, the number was 6,600. In 2015, it will be 1,500. How can the SNP Government possibly be blamed for such decimation and destruction of an industry?</p><p>Here is picture 2. I have spent the past two and a half years researching why Westminster Governments had, as we suspected, denied in the early 1980s the opportunity that existed in the Firth of Clyde for oil and gas production. The Secretary of State for Scotland at the time, who was a local Ayr MP, said that resources were there in exploitable quantities. I have the confidential ministerial papers that show that the Ministry of Defence refused to allow drilling in specific areas because of &#8220;special circumstances&#8221;, which we know means nuclear submarines.</p><p>Over 30 years, we have lost thousands of jobs&#8212;not just in shipbuilding&#8212;because of the cover-up. Can members imagine the jobs in oil-rig production and maintenance and in the supply chain in Govan if we had been allowed to go ahead with such drilling? Thousands of long-term jobs have been lost, and for what?</p><p>Our amendment refers to</p><p>&#8220;the choices that could be made to support increased diversification&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>that could have happened&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;and ... action to boost exports.&#8221;</p><p>That is absolutely right.</p><p>Because of Westminster&#8217;s obsequiousness, that &#163;100 billion spend on nuclear submarines and now Trident means that we have lost that added value. Yet still Labour continues to attach itself to the seekers of the lost empire. That is what it is about. It is not just about UK defence contracts but about years of missed opportunity, a lack of vision and a lack of planning and strategy.</p><p>As Charles Harrity, a senior GMB organiser&#8212;and a real person&#8212;said last week:</p><p>&#8220;I would say it&#8217;s more a case of no planning, no strategy ... This is really about whether a British government ... has any kind of industrial strategy at all and the evidence of today shows that they haven&#8217;t&#8221;.</p><p>They never have. Still the Labour Party wishes to hitch itself to a Con-Dem boat that is steadily sinking.</p><p>Worse is the politicisation of what was clearly a commercial decision. The Government contracts with BAE Systems, not with another country. Surely the business and financial heads of BAE Systems are not going to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in upgrading a shipbuilding facility because of the constitutional situation; they will do so because of the skills, quality and rate of return on that investment that they will get for their shareholders. That understandable commercial judgment will now and in the future cross country boundaries. Joint procurement of defence contracts will allow the Clyde to compete and to work with the MOD in the UK; the Clyde will also be able to work with many other countries on many marine products. That should be our aspiration for the people on the Clyde. As part of a diversified industry in Scotland, there is no reason on earth why the Clyde should not be able to compete for business on a commercial basis and to work with other countries to do just that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752431", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Defence Industry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I share Annabelle Ewing&#8217;s view on the proposed loss of jobs in the fine city of Portsmouth.

Regarding his statement about who pays for HS2, does he not think that Scotland already pays a disproportionate part of its taxes to the UK revenue? However, I welcome the efforts that have been made by the Minister for Transport and Veterans to take HS2 beyond Leeds and Manchester to Scotland.</p><p>It is easy to applaud the minister because he is our minister, but I applaud him not for that reason but because he has done what is generally widely accepted as a great job of carving, from a minimal capital resource budget, some project deliverables across that spectrum of reduced spend. Those projects include the Queensferry crossing, which, incidentally, was endorsed by Audit Scotland as being of sound management, on target and on budget. That tells me that he has achieved that success only through good and sound management, involvement and practice.</p><p>I will turn, if I may, to some of the achievements and opportunities in the south of Scotland. First, the Borders railway project, which the minister mentioned, will lead to the reopening of the Waverley line, which from 1849 onwards ran from Edinburgh through the Borders and was later extended to Carlisle. Following the Beeching report, the line was axed along with many others in 1969 and its reopening was not even considered for some 30 years. I pay tribute to the previous Scottish Government and the Campaign for Borders Rail, which ensured that this rural Borders phoenix would rise again.</p><p>The re-establishment of that important rail link will open up and reconnect the Borders communities with each other and with the nation&#8217;s capital and, in so doing, will make its contribution to climate change targets. In addition, the Borders rail link will deliver the &#163;33&#160;million of economic benefits that will flow from its construction and, more important, open up the Borders to deliver many more social, economic and environmental benefits. Who knows whether, with more control over our own spending in the years to come, the extension of that line to Carlisle, perhaps with spurs to Stranraer, will fully open up the south-west and restore the line to what it once was? I will also say in passing that, in my dealings with Network Rail and ScotRail, I have been very impressed by their professionalism.</p><p>As well as our rail strategy, the futuristic connectivity of our airports, ports, rails and roads will drive our sustainable development so that we meet our economic growth targets as we go forward. Of course I applaud the decision to buy Prestwick airport, but it is not just about that airport and its confidence in supporting other airports on maintenance, repair, overhaul and cargo. Going forward into the 21st century, we need Prestwick airport to be part of an aviation framework in which, colluding with our island airports, it can provide worldwide direct flights and communications to and from Scotland. Who knows whether, with its unique runway capabilities, Prestwick airport could see future intergalactic and space flights? Of course, that is a matter for current and on-going conversations.</p><p>A much more immediate possibility is that we could link all our transport infrastructure with our tourism and export possibilities. For example, it is unacceptable that Scotland hosts 50 cruise ships per year, whereas Copenhagen hosts 500. Development of our ports is critical and I would like to see, for example, deep dredging of Troon and Ayr harbours, which could be developed in partnership with my favourite airport, which I mentioned. The same could apply to Edinburgh airport and Leith or Cockenzie, for example.</p><p>Additionally and briefly, pulling exports from the north of England for worldwide distribution from east and west of Scotland ports and airports would at one stroke reduce carbon emissions, costs and time and expand our huge export capabilities. An integrated and efficient physical connectivity related to our broadband ambitions can, and will, make us truly fit for the 21st century.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22741929", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Modernising Scotland&#8217;s Transport Infrastructure"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am of course delighted to support the motion.

That is accepted as a sine qua non, but as Scotland plans major decarbonisation and reduction in all thermal generation capacity, that plan sits easily alongside CCS as a transitional and on-going supporting technology. Our aim is to secure that supporting technology.</p><p>As the minister pointed out, there is an overarching need for clarity on the policy and objectives of electricity market reform&#8212;and EMR&#8217;s hoped-for audacity in seeking a better level of competition in securing such technology and in delivering CCS. We cannot sit like rabbits in the headlights of on-coming energy technology vehicles. We cannot be like Mr Micawber and hope that something will turn up&#8212;in this case, to marry our objectives in relation to the environment and economic growth. We must have a clear steer on where we want to go, and CCS is a key driver in the pursuit of that.</p><p>To return to my opening quotation, I applaud the leadership that has been shown by Professor Haszeldine, the British Geological Survey, the UK Government and our minister, who, at the SCCS conference in Edinburgh, issued a call to arms to delegates from Europe in which he asked them to recognise that decarbonisation will come not only from large projects, but from projects of a variety of sizes. It was, he said, in that way that the huge potential of the North Sea&#8217;s storage capacity could be unlocked. We have not even talked about the potential that exists in Scottish fields off the west coast&#8212;the Ayrshire coast&#8212;and the lower Atlantic. That is for another day.</p><p>Although I accept the meaningful caveats of Mr Fraser and Mr Harvie on cost and the stage of development of CCS, the conference that I mentioned set down a marker that will support the vision and the technological approach that will be needed. That was mirrored by the recent signing of a memorandum of understanding between the CCS representatives of Scotland, the UK and the Guangdong province of China, which will pave the way for research on, development and demonstration of, and knowledge exchange on innovative carbon capture use and storage technologies. Hopefully, Scotland can then become an exporter of CCS coal and gas technology expertise. SCCS has internationally renowned researchers and state-of-the-art facilities but, as with any successful new technology, business or market, a limitation on competition may itself limit much-needed development.</p><p>We are talking about an energy resource in which we have a potentially positive pioneering advantage. We have the internationally respected research capability, the operational and technical skills that have been gained from our many years of involvement in the oil and gas industries, the physical infrastructure&#8212;particularly in the aforementioned central North Sea storage hub&#8212;and preferred bid status at Peterhead and Grangemouth. We have the capacity and the land to have more and smaller opportunities that can be moved along much more quickly.</p><p>However, we do not have an incentive or incentives through the meaningful application of an EMR-based contract for difference to the early development and crystallisation of this critical element of our energy plan and our energy future. I hope that such projects will be suitable for the &#8364;70 billion horizon 2020 fund, which aims to get major projects on the go quickly.</p><p>It is abhorrent nonsense that a technology that could transform how we generate power, how we target carbon emissions and how we secure power supply and storage is not proceeding quickly. It is sad to have a potential missed opportunity from a technology that could increase direct output from our Scottish economy by &#163;11.3 billion, which would result in &#163;2.7 billion of gross value added and would create and support 5,000 jobs, just because projects are not proceeding apace.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698981", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carbon Capture and Storage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If I may, I would like to follow Stewart Stevenson in quoting Professor Stuart Haszeldine, research director of Scottish carbon capture and storage.

It is a long-term yet unrequited love affair. No matter how much I shared my emotions, shed many tears and had the occasional smile&#8212;no matter how often I cared for and adored the instruments of that love, I confess that that love is still unfulfilled. My love affair of course is with the sport of kings and people&#8212;golf.</p><p>It is a love affair that spawned a son, of whom I am very proud, who is a senior teaching professional at one of the UK&#8217;s top country clubs, in Surrey. It is a love affair that has seen all my grandsons but in particular my four-year-old grandson Fraser outdriving their granddad. I am told by my son and my grandsons that I have an old man&#8217;s slow swing so, although I may love more slowly, I still do so as ardently and as compellingly as ever.</p><p>I also admit to having an obsession that is shared with many of seeking the holy grail and its possible physical manifestation at Rosslyn. That is mirrored by an obsession with seeking its sporting equivalent, be it at Muirfield, near Rosslyn; Troon in South Ayrshire, where we hold the 2016 open championship; Prestwick Old, where the first open championship was held; St Andrews with its Old, New and Eden courses, the new courses at Kingsbarns and the Duke&#8217;s course; and of course at Turnberry.</p><p>Turnberry is famous, as has been mentioned, for the 1977 open duel in the sun between two of the world&#8217;s greatest golfers&#8212;Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, to whom Tavish Scott referred. Turnberry is also famous because at the ninth hole on the Ailsa course stand the remnants of the castle where, allegedly, Robert the Bruce was born. Indeed it is a theatre that is suitable for heroes and kings of golf and of history.</p><p>In seeking the requital of that love affair, I have walked, I have hooked, I have sliced, I have duck hooked and yipped my way around courses such as Cruden Bay, Elie, Rosemount, Carnoustie, Ladybank and many of the other great Scottish courses.</p><p>Next year, although having played Kings, Queens and the former Monarch course, I will be allowed, I hope, to enter the new coliseum of golf, one of the great citadels&#8212;the Gleneagles Centenary golf course. It is an amphitheatre that more than matches those that have been mentioned, such as the Belfry, Kiawah Island and the beautiful course of Medinah, which held the Ryder cup last year.</p><p>The prospect of the competition between the great golfing regions of the USA and Europe, led respectively by the aforesaid Tom Watson and Paul McGinley is mouthwatering to a golfer. This will not be so much a rumble in the jungle as a fight on the fairway. For the first time in 40 years, since 1973, and for only the second time in the history of Samuel Ryder&#8217;s cup, Scotland will play host to the greatest gladiatorial golfing match play in history.</p><p>Welcome to the home of true golf&#8212;match play, not stroke play.</p><p>Yesterday, I played the Centenary course, which is a classic course, but regrettably, I could play it only on the internet. The greatest of all golfers, Jack Nicklaus, who designed it, described it as</p><p>&#8220;The finest parcel of land in the world I have ever been given to work with.&#8221;</p><p>I played it last night and I scored a respectable 70. Well, that was on hole 1, Bracken Brae, and then I moved on to the second hole. The web-based system tells the player that</p><p>&#8220;The green, slightly raised above the fairway, is bunkered at the front and back and lies at an angle.&#8221;</p><p>I do not know how McIlroy or Woods will approach that course, but I would certainly need a satnav to play it in reality.</p><p>So my love is coming home. The course has been adorned externally by an updated railway system, with timetables that we discussed with ScotRail at a dinner the other evening. Those who were involved should be congratulated on that adornment. The &#163;5.27 million investment in the Ryder cup and the Commonwealth games has been money well spent. There are new and safe slip roads on to the A90, thereby exhibiting all that is good in our scenery and so much more. I make one appeal, however, which is that we keep all our new and old roads, new and old streets, free from litter so that we can present our country in its best light.</p><p>We will have an exhibition that demonstrates our welcome to all our international visitors and shows them Scotland&#8217;s quality food and drink, customer service, infrastructure, sensible hospitality and, hopefully, pricing, and efficiency. We should remember that we want our international visitors to come back, to come back, and to come back.</p><p>Above all, the real legacy will follow the Ryder cup. We have heard much mentioned about the concept of clubgolf. I have always subscribed to the idea and I am proud that the Government has pledged to put a golf club in every child&#8217;s hand by the age of nine, in the same way as I would like to see violins and pianos made available across the nation as they are in Raploch. Who knows? That might create a future Scottish golf champion. That should be our ambition and aspiration because, in its own tiny way, golf will play its role in a more expansive and happier Scots society.</p><p>Like any aspiring Lothario, I will enter the great golfing boudoir of Gleneagles to see great love being consummated next year. I applaud all who have been involved from government&#8212;the First Minister, the minister for sport, Perth and Kinross Council and many others who had the foresight to determine the huge return that there will be from a well-spent investment.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697799", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ryder Cup 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I say first that David McLetchie, who chaired the cross-party group on golf, which I attended, was a great companion on the golf course and a very good companion at the 19th hole.

I listened with increasing depression to the speeches from the rows of Typhons on the Opposition seats. Few of the arguments that were posed addressed the fundamental issue that we will address first next year, which is the seeking of economic and political control by and for our country.</p><p>It is in the context of the famous Clinton election phrase, &#8220;It&#8217;s the economy, stupid&#8221;, that we should see the primacy of the economic argument&#8212;and not just next year&#8212;in relation to the UK and global economies. It is about how prosperous on an on-going basis this country and its people can be, and it is about building, from that, the kind of country and people that we wish to be. After that priority, properly set out, will come the resolution of the various unions such as the social union, the defence union and so on.</p><p>In the current global economic structure, it is fanciful to imagine that a nation can be isolated from international finance and capital-flow pressures. However, given the need in such situations for flexibility and focus, I believe that a Scotland that is in command of its own economy will be best placed to handle those pressures. In fact, I will demonstrate later that small, economically robust countries can counter international interest-rate pressures, and can do so well. I say in passing that, given the rant that goes on about the currency, we should remember that it is Westminster that needs Scotland&#8217;s productive assets to shore up sterling, rather than the other way round.</p><p>The previous Institute for Fiscal Studies report, at the end of last year, stated:</p><p>&#8220;The UK&#8217;s fiscal position in 2014 ... is unlikely to be healthy ... potential national income is now estimated to be a full 13% lower in 2016-17 than was projected by the Treasury back in 2008.&#8221;</p><p>Total UK debt&#8212;personal, public and corporate&#8212;is &#163;1.40 for every &#163;1 of national income. I am certain that that figure will increase on the back of another housing bubble.</p><p>I return to the current IFS study, which states on page 78:</p><p>&#8220;if North Sea revenues turn out to be substantially stronger than the OBR forecasts&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>they have not been particularly good in the past&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;the fiscal situation in Scotland might actually be ... stronger than that for the UK as a whole&#8221;.</p><p>Of course, revenues are not just a product of price, but are a consequence of volume. We have not even considered the volumes of oil and gas that exist, for example, off the west coast of Scotland. I suggest that we watch this space.</p><p>In a global sense, the David Skilling report in 2012 indicated that small developed countries with populations of fewer than 20&#160;million have economically outperformed larger developed countries over the past few decades. Of 34 advanced economies as defined by the IMF, 23 have populations smaller than 20&#160;million.</p><p>However, it is not just our size but the strength of our balance sheet that counts. I do not need to rehearse the asset disposition of our natural productive resources, our education system or our people or, contrarily, a fairer distribution of liabilities. In 2011-12, Scotland&#8217;s per capita share of public sector net debt was 62 per cent and the UK&#8217;s was 71 per cent&#8212;assets better, liabilities lower. When Opposition members talk of Scotland taking its share of the UK national debt&#8212;managed, I hasten to add, by the UK Treasury&#8212;let them also talk of our substantial assets. The real value of a country, just like that of a company or an individual, is in its productivity and net worth&#8212;and what worth we have.</p><p>Even without the GDP that is generated in the North Sea, Scotland&#8217;s GDP per head is almost the same as that for the rest of the UK, which is distorted primarily by London&#8217;s GDP. When we add in North Sea output on a geographic basis, Scotland&#8217;s GDP per head goes up to 117 per cent of the UK level. Of course, this is not just about our oil and gas assets; our brand and reputation are propelling us towards becoming a renewable energy powerhouse and a world-renowned tourist destination, and we must bear in mind our green energy reserves and skills and industries such as food and drink, and all the others that have been mentioned this afternoon.</p><p>After losing the resource of our young people in two world wars and with the centralisation of the economy in London after the second world war, Scotland had been injured. However, here is the news: we are on our way back with an economy that is stimulated by enterprise agencies, that attracts world-renowned businesses and which is supported by our social enterprises&#8212;509 of which are in Glasgow&#8212;our knowledge-transfer capabilities and so on.</p><p>Of course we have a lot to do to increase the number of surviving small businesses, to capitalise further on research and development in our colleges and universities and to repair damages and imbalances in the economy so that we can seek a fair and just economy&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697073", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Yesterday, I sat and listened to the debate about Scotland&#8217;s future.

The concept, the design, the development, the making and the engineering of both hard and soft products, and, above all, the marketing, the selling and the servicing of the same are an infusion that makes you want more. Unsurprisingly, therefore, I support the main thrust of the motion. I do, however, place a question mark over the implied emergence of global economic recovery. If Mr Fraser will bear with me, I will get to the enterprise issue in a minute.</p><p>Recent predictions of a slowdown in Chinese and Indian GDP and a slowing in United States employment, aligned to inflation forecasts, puts one somewhat in the Jeremiah camp. Here in the UK, Osborne-esque ebullience on the economy is just that; it is a fig-leaf. If I may, I address that particular issue to Margaret McDougall. Total debt in the UK&#8212;personal, public and corporate&#8212;stands at &#163;1.40 for every &#163;1 that we earn. That is down from &#163;1.60 over the past year, but it is set to rise again because we have house mortgage lending instead of the diversion of investment lending as intended to much needed access to finance for our SMEs. Here comes another housing bubble, just in time for the next Westminster election.</p><p>However, leaving the Jeremiah instinct aside, I think that the situation provides Scotland with a divergent economic opportunity to be realised via its various good enterprise networks after a yes vote next year. Although it will be easy to be critical, as some will be, constructive criticism should be set against a generally improving scenario because of anti-austerity actions, as were manifest in the excellent budget today. Since 2007, 18,160 new enterprises have been born; six years later 54.7 per cent of them still survive&#8212;despite harsh economic conditions&#8212;which is 2.7 per cent above the UK average.</p><p>In Scotland, there were 2,215 more new business starts in 2011 than in 2009; in Dundee, there were 10 more; in Perth and Kinross, there were 40 more; and, importantly, there were 25 more in South Ayrshire. In terms of the demise of enterprises over the same period, the number for Scotland fell from 15,085 to 14,110; in Dundee, the number fell from 320 to 300; in Perth and Kinross, it fell from 480 to 440; and, importantly, it fell in South Ayrshire from 335 to 290. In general, despite the financial environment, performance is up and recovery in Scotland is working in the face of Westminster austerity. All the data, of course, is courtesy of the Office for National Statistics.</p><p>Now, are we complacent? Of course we are not. Can the agencies deliver even greater efficiency in national economic growth? We heard this morning from witnesses at a meeting of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee about the need for greater localism and better communication between the business gateway and other agencies. The varied locations and organisational construction of the business gateways provides a patchy approach in some cases to cohesion and a fit with the national enterprise strategy. However, I feel sure that that will be addressed in the not too distant future.</p><p>There is little doubt, however, that both Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Development International have played a very significant part in Scotland&#8217;s current anti-austerity situation and its positive reaction to rebutting what has been the advance of industrial and commercial recession. There is also their role in raising Scotland&#8217;s international profile, underwritten by the Ernst &amp; Young report declaring that Scotland is the place in the UK to be for inward investment. Our stock is higher, as is our profile and quality, and our export potential and performance continue to rise. The enterprise networks&#8217; pursuit of the Government&#8217;s economic strategy, concentrating and focusing on winning sectors, is a totem to management and people in organisations and will continue to be an exciting entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>Although it is not yet a formal Government enterprise network agency, it would be remiss of me not to recognise the burgeoning social enterprise and third sector network. That important enterprise sector grew by 28 per cent in the past two years and we were told this morning that it has 335 routes to finance. It needs meaningful business support, but it is increasingly a key enterprise network. With the impending public procurement and community empowerment and renewal bills, it will be even more important as the days go on.</p><p>In the face of the most titanic of recessions, Scotland has been open for business, and the contribution of the enterprise agencies, notwithstanding their on-going review of efficiencies and organisations, has been a bulwark in that effort.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696119", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Enterprise Networks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Nothing, but nothing&#8212;well, almost nothing&#8212;and I say this from years of domestic and international business experience, makes the blood flow more than entrepreneurial success.

He warned strongly that the gap between rich and poor in the UK was not sustainable and that the UK was in a particularly parlous position, which will ultimately lead to social tensions that we could only ever have imagined in our worst nightmares.</p><p>The point has been made about what happened with the banks. Earlier today, I highlighted the fact that this year&#8217;s bank bonuses&#8212;which were delayed for a month for tax purposes&#8212;come to &#163;75.1 billion, which is two and a half times what the Scottish Government gets to run the country each year. Some 5 per cent of the UK population owns more than 85 per cent of the wealth. Oxfam has pointed out that the better-off are 273 times better off than the most deprived. Of course, a fundamental change to the structure is needed in terms of Westminster&#8217;s relationship with the banks. I commend the recommendations in the Oxfam report.</p><p>It is a nonsense that an income-rich country such as Scotland has the level of poverty that it does. We have tremendous assets, not just in oil and gas and renewables but in food and drink and tourism and in the inherent capabilities of our people. It is a nonsense that unemployment is as high as it is and that we have underemployment and zero-hours contracts. The living wage is a palliative. We need to get to a high-wage, high-productivity economy&#8212;against a background in which the economic position of the banks to support a new housing bubble makes one deeply concerned.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has said that the Government will consider Oxfam&#8217;s recommendations, including its proposal for a poverty commission or tsar. I understand the rationale behind that call, but I am not sure that I agree with having a poverty tsar&#8212;I think that we should all be poverty tsars and highlight what that means. In my case, because of my interests, that will involve social enterprise, which will unleash economic opportunity and draw on social contribution. I would contrast the contribution of social enterprises and of communities to that of the banks. The standards of social behaviour and the level of added value are clearly miles apart. In the same way, I contrast carers with payday lenders&#8212;the sharks who lie just underneath the surface of lending. Attention must be drawn to the social behaviour of carers and to the care that they provide.</p><p>I will also mention the issue of communities.

The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8217;s recent report on how Scotland will meet its renewables target to generate the equivalent of 100 per cent of our gross electricity demand by 2020 perhaps shows that the committee spent a disproportionate amount of time deliberating on wind rather than water, but no matter: today&#8217;s debate helps to address that to some extent. The motion underlines our hydroelectricity tradition and our commitment to install more than 120 hydro-generating stations of varying sizes, which will be founded on sound micro and macro mechanics and technology.</p><p>Several years ago, as a youngster, I visited Pitlochry, to be transfixed by a feeling of power: the power of and from water. Just as I was excited then by that feeling, I am excited now by the opportunities that we have to move forward.</p><p>Last year, I was shown the prospect of a resurrection of significant micro-hydro generation through the activities that are taking place at an estate near Johnstonebridge. I applaud our Government&#8217;s commitment to the future of that technology in proposing to leave the support banding at one ROC&#8212;renewables obligation certificate&#8212;and to stimulate further investment of micro projects under the feed-in tariff agenda.</p><p>Those micro projects are critical, not just as an aggregate addition to national targets, but because of their community impact. Community benefit is important, whether in Maldie, Fort William or elsewhere in Scotland. However, as I highlighted in last week&#8217;s debate on national planning framework 3, community ownership and/or participation, including financial decision making, will be a key element in the success of our energy programmes as we drive them forward.</p><p>I commend one company for involving the community, but we must go further and ensure that our curriculum and school communities increasingly and even more intensively reflect topics that relate to energy and climate change. Just as next year&#8217;s vote recognises the political environment, so the education of today and tomorrow should increasingly embrace the implications of our physical environment.</p><p>That said, all great schemes may &#8220;Gang aft agley&#8221; unless the infusion of water-powered energy is given the arteries to be part of the national electricity body. It is therefore essential that grid connectivity and establishment are produced and sustained, not only for hydro, but for micropower generation and associated pumped-storage projects in Scotland.</p><p>The fortune of God-given natural assets such as onshore and offshore wind and inland and offshore water, including marine and tidal sources and the possibility of solar farms, puts Scotland in a good place not only to deliver energy indigenously and, potentially, to export electricity to England and Europe, but to export our technology and develop our skills, and thereby further increase job opportunities.</p><p>The World Bank is pushing to develop hydro power, which it now recognises as a medium to resolve the tension between economic development and low-carbon emissions in developing countries. As Rachel Kyte, the bank&#8217;s vice-president for sustainable development&#8212;and the top staff member and adviser of the team of the bank&#8217;s president Jim Yong Kim&#8212;said:</p><p>&#8220;hydro is a very big part of the solution for Africa ... South Asia and Southeast Asia. .?.?. I fundamentally believe we have to be involved&#8221;.</p><p>She said that the earlier move out of hydro</p><p>&#8220;was the wrong message. .?.?. That was then. This is now. We are back.&#8221;</p><p>It was additionally significant that Peter Bosshard, the policy director of International Rivers, a group that is opposed to the World Bank&#8217;s evolving hydro policy, did not oppose the general principle, but argued for smaller projects that are designed around communities. I am on his team in supporting small, microgeneration activities.</p><p>Scotland has the unique opportunity to augment its other forms of renewable energy production by stimulating and investing in community-based hydro projects, not just to drive energy costs lower and so have an impact on fuel poverty and climate change at home, but to develop and export our historical expertise and so do the same internationally.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693928", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hydro Power"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At the beginning of the debate, I wondered whether we had stumbled into it via the questions about the VisitScotland website, given the multiple enumerations of historical hydro events, embellished by thoughts about the Archimedes screw, intelligent washing machines and&#8212;of course&#8212;Mary Scanlon&#8217;s mussels.

Today, we highlight the dangers of the interest-rate swaps embedded in tailored business loans&#8212;the shark that lies just below the surface in bank lending to small and medium-sized businesses.</p><p>Much though it went beyond my entrepreneurial spirit, after 2008 I suggested that we should take those banks that are supported by public funds at least temporarily into public ownership, to ensure that the banks changed their casino culture, which existed particularly in the investment parts of some banks. We did not, and the banks have not.</p><p>Privilege does not extend to this Parliament so we cannot name or shame, but the banks concerned know who they are. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury confirmed to the Westminster Parliament that Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank have agreed to review at least one customer&#8217;s fixed-rate loan.</p><p>The interest-rate swap mechanism embedded in tailored business loans is a relatively simple finance mechanism. Where two parties have taken out loans of equal value, one at the prevailing fixed rate and the other at a floating rate, the parties swap the loans and, as the loan principal is the same, in effect only the interest rates are swapped. The problem is that one party, in this case the bank, demands a risk premium for its gambling from the other party, which in this case is a small business client. That premium on the floating interest rate was tied to the London interbank offered rate, which members will recall was the subject of daily manipulation by bank representation on the LIBOR committee. Here were bankers&#8212;or at least some of them&#8212;gambling with other people&#8217;s chips.</p><p>The interest-rate gambling embedded in tailored business loans means that such loans are not fixed-rate loans; but&#8212;as some of our friends in the public gallery today will confirm&#8212;the banks say that they are. The banks will even smooch people into thinking that such loans are better and more protected than fixed-rate loans, but that is not the case. The conditions inherent in those tailored business loans, particularly on exiting or breaking the loan, are penal. Banks will stay quiet about and/or surreptitiously write into the small print conditions on the loans without making it clear that their investment risk is being passed on to the client. The banks did not want people to know that exiting the loan might ultimately cost them 20, 30 or even 40 per cent of the loan value.</p><p>I could regale members with stories of what has happened so far. For example, although Mr and Mrs L have paid off most of their initial loan, they now owe more because of the exit or break fees. Mr and Mrs H were told that they would need to pay 30 per cent of their large loan for paying it off early. I could mention the experiences of Mr P, a tea shop owner; or Mr M, who himself was previously involved in banking; or Mr B, a successful small business man in Dundee; or Mr Mac; or the church that cannot now provide the community services for which it was renowned because it must repay expensive missold loans.</p><p>The UK Government and regulators are exploring whether to expand the compensation scheme to cover missold swaps on fixed loans, but they may be too late&#8212;the horse may have bolted. It is believed that, throughout the UK, there are 40,000 embedded interest-rate swaps as well as a further 60,000 fixed-rate loans that are subject to scrutiny. All of those affect good small businesses. As Rod Campbell said, &#163;2&#160;billion may need to be set aside to address the issue.</p><p>However, that will not be enough to compensate people for the loss of property and lifestyle, nor assuage the worry that has been created and the unnecessary anxiety that has been imposed on many good small business people. It will certainly not be enough to assuage the anger.

However, there is a statistical dilemma about the transposition of anticipated increases in unemployment to higher levels of underemployment. A large part of that dilemma might have been mitigated had the London Government had a meaningful economic strategy and performance and harnessed that to a true skills and work programme, as our Government is trying to do.</p><p>Only last week, the IMF informed the economic debate by saying that the UK should drop its austerity programme, but that suggestion fell on Osborne&#8217;s deaf ears. The employment level in Scotland is higher, happily, than it is in the rest of the UK at 71.8 per cent. Of course, we wish that number to be much higher, but it cannot be understood why that figure has remained relatively high in circumstances in which there has been a reduction in capacity, output and productivity&#8212;circumstances that would have been anticipated in the economic downturn that we have experienced.</p><p>Normally in circumstances in which real productivity has fallen 3 per cent below its 2008 peak, a realistic and regular reduction in employment would be expected, particularly given the growth of the labour force in this period, but there has not been a reduction.

The rise of those sectors marries that work ethic to innovation and enterprise. That may be the reason why the statistics are indefinable and even, indeed, unreliable.

It is not just their resilience that I applaud, but their patience, as we await delivery of the UK Energy Bill and its proposed reforms. I regret to say that that process has taken longer than the gestation of an elephant; in fact, it has taken longer than the gestation of a herd of elephants.</p><p>Among all the talk that we have heard about future political uncertainties, such as the uncertainty surrounding the UK&#8217;s involvement in Europe, there is one great uncertainty. It is the uncertainty that will be caused by a delayed, unclear and unstructured energy funding policy as we move forward. Although tariffs and customer bills are exceedingly important, as Murdo Fraser pointed out, the raw component source pricing is fundamental to reform of the market and its demand and supply elements.</p><p>In that context, I would like to dwell on one element of EMR&#8212;the likely proposals on contracts for difference for nuclear energy and its funding, and the consequences that they could have. They could divert significant investment away from the preferred options of the components of a more balanced and renewable energy policy, that is harnessed to established decarbonisation targets.</p><p>Ed Davey&#8212;he of the anti-nuclear-power brigade only six years ago&#8212;the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change appeared before our Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee last June, and clearly stated that there would be &#8220;no public subsidy&#8221; for nuclear power, confirming that to be part of the 2010 coalition agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. Indeed, that was part of the Conservative manifesto for the election of that year.</p><p>Mr Davey reiterated that position in his evidence to the UK Energy and Climate Change Committee on 20 November 2012. In a letter to me dated 26 March this year, he wrote:</p><p>&#8220;we will not provide a public subsidy for new nuclear power.&#8221;</p><p>His letter goes on to say, however:</p><p>&#8220;In reference to decommissioning of new build, the Government has said that new nuclear developers will have to meet the costs of decommissioning in full, but the costs of the Funded Decommissioning Programme (FDP) are included in the calculations of the developer&#8217;s returns under a Contract for Difference&#8221;.</p><p>For that, read &#8220;subsidy&#8221;.</p><p>It is not a small subsidy because, as Professor Tom Burke of Imperial College London put it, if the strike price is set, for example, at the politically sensitive level of &#163;100 per megawatt hour, and the market price is stabilised at &#163;50 per unit&#8212;the Government forecast for 2030 is &#163;59 per unit&#8212;a supplier such as EDF at Hinkley Point might receive &#163;50&#160;billion in support from the UK over 40 years, and that cannot simply be transferred to consumer bills.</p><p>Beyond that, EDF apparently wants a guarantee that the Government will buy all possible output from Hinkley Point, not just what is needed. It is little wonder that the chairman of Centrica confirmed at the recent annual general meeting that nuclear is no longer a cheap option, which is why Centrica withdrew from the project. Dare I even mention the cost setbacks at Flamanville in France and at Olkiluoto in Finland, or the consequences of Germany closing all its nuclear reactors by 2022? Also, of course, there are Chernobyl and Fukushima.</p><p>There is little doubt that the nuclear energy trigger is playing, and has played, a very significant role in the delay of EMR and the announcement of strike prices. There is a rush on the part of the UK Government to make a determination on the issue, which is undermining a sensible strategy for energy and the economy. The UK Government says that there is no deal with EDF on the &#163;14&#160;billion Hinkley Point nuclear power station, but of course there will be a deal, because EDF cannot afford to withdraw and plunge the UK Government into energy insecurity&#8212;which is where Scotland comes into play as regards demand from south of the border.</p><p>The UK Government needs economic growth, but its economic policy negates focused public spending. The Treasury&#8217;s paws are all over the electricity market reform, and it is making the whole energy policy totally unworkable. Private money and private investment, of which there is plenty, will be needed for such nuclear projects, but because of the inherent risks, investors will be looking for a subsidy through the contracts for difference so that they can secure a significant return on their investment.</p><p>The issue is not just one of securing investment for build. The decommissioning costs of cleaning up the likes of Sellafield nuclear waste site have now reached &#163;67.5&#160;billion, and that figure is still rising, at &#163;1.5&#160;billion per year. As has previously been said, this is the economics of the madhouse.</p><p>Divestment of the investment into more quickly developed and, ultimately, cheaper energy, is in danger of going into a bottomless pit.

I stand in place of our injured convener, David Stewart, who had a particular interest in the subject covered in PE1441.</p><p>In this second Public Petitions Committee chamber debate this session, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issues that have been raised with the committee by Professor David Crichton in PE1441, which refers to the challenges of flooding and the attendant flood insurance problems. Professor Crichton has spent a large number of years in the insurance industry, latterly as a consultant advising insurers across four continents, and is a founder member of every flood liaison and advice group&#8212;or FLAG&#8212;in Scotland. The groups cover 94 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s population.</p><p>The petition, which was submitted last August, highlights the importance of the matter in light of the climatic changes that we see and experience every day and seeks primarily to ensure that Scottish interests are represented and considered in discussions between the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the UK insurance industry. As matters stand, financial services, including insurance, are reserved to Westminster, whereas flood risk management decisions relating to Scotland are devolved.</p><p>The committee is aware that negotiations are taking place between DEFRA and the insurance industry on arrangements to succeed the current insurance agreements as enshrined in a joint agreement known as the statement of principles, which is due to expire in seven weeks&#8217; time at the end of June. We also know that the Scottish Government has been engaged, if indirectly, in those discussions as they affect Scotland. For reasons that I will try to explain, it is important and very urgent that appropriate arrangements are put in place from 1 July onwards.</p><p>One-off flooding is one of the greatest natural threats&#8212;if not the greatest&#8212;that we and the rest of the globe face, and well-documented examples of the damage caused by flooding and its serious long-lasting effects increasingly invade our sitting rooms.</p><p>In the United Kingdom in the 1990s, we had two flood events that cost &#163;150 million, yet in the past decade we have had five events costing &#163;3 billion, with 2007 being a particularly disastrous year. Debate on the reasons for that is for another day, although it is safe to say that a committed global approach to addressing climate change becomes more critical as each day passes.</p><p>Because of its different landscape and topography, Scotland does not face the same degree of flooding as the rest of the UK. There have been examples of severe flooding in Scotland but not to the same degree as in the rest of the UK. I know that that lies at the heart of the petition and, therefore, at the heart of the motion.</p><p>This is not a them-and-us debate. However, there is a manifest anomaly in the background to the motion. There is an unfairness&#8212;an inequity&#8212;because there is a cross-subsidy that relies on families in Scotland who are insured against high flood risk subsidising, through a higher premium, the higher volume of at-risk properties and the higher risk of flooding down south. Regrettably, 23.1 per cent of English and Welsh households are at risk, whereas only 4.5 per cent of Scots households are at risk.</p><p>It might be helpful if I set out some of the background to the petition. In 2008, as I mentioned, an updated joint statement on the provision of flood insurance was agreed with the insurers. According to the Association of British Insurers, the statement was originally drawn up in 2000 and was supposed to be a temporary sticking plaster&#8212;a palliative&#8212;while the Scottish Government, the UK Government and the ABI worked together to enable flood insurance to continue to be widely available without distorting the market.</p><p>The statement identified a number of measures to be taken. The first was to improve the understanding of flood risk from all sources. The second was to work towards putting in place a longer-term strategy&#8212;for 25-plus years&#8212;to reduce flood risk. That strategy would set out the Government&#8217;s objectives and measures backed by local planning and funding arrangements. The third measure was the retention of a national planning policy to ensure that inappropriate development in flood risk areas would be prevented and that any essential new development in medium or high flood risk areas would be flood resistant or at least as resilient as possible. The fourth measure was to raise awareness in areas where flood risks are significant and to encourage actions to mitigate and minimise the risk of flooding, including reinstatement of flood-damaged property in a much more resilient way. The fifth measure was to promote access to insurance for low-income households.</p><p>For its part, the insurance industry was committed until the end of June 2013 to continuing to make flood insurance for domestic properties and small businesses available as part of standard policies if the flood risk was not significant&#8212;significance is defined as a 1 in 75 annual probability of flooding. It was also committed to continuing to offer flood cover to existing domestic property and small business customers at significant flood risk provided that the relevant local authority had announced plans and notified the ABI of its intention to reduce the risk for those customers to below significant within five years.</p><p>The agreement ensured that flood insurance would be available for homes in Scotland that were at risk of flooding. However, it will expire at the start of July and the insurance industry has made it clear that it does not intend to renew it, owing to its belief that that would prevent the development of a free market in flood insurance&#8212;a basis that the ABI believes will allow it to establish more accountable and attributable premiums.</p><p>We are at a crunch point, with only seven weeks to go before we know whether those in our communities who are at high risk of flooding will be covered by insurance or whether they will continue to be penalised because of the disproportionality between Scotland and the rest of the UK of which I have just spoken.</p><p>It might be suggested that because the various measures that have been taken on flood management in Scotland, such as those that are contained in the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009, have not been implemented elsewhere, the disproportionality of the subsidy becomes much more profound. Requests to have stricter planning rules to control flood plain development, more spending on structural flood defences and more resilient building regulations, which have largely been complied with in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have not been complied with to the same extent in England, and that is having an overall impact on the insurance industry&#8217;s approach to future agreements.</p><p>Notwithstanding that feeling, the Public Petitions Committee was advised that the Scottish Government had commissioned the centre of expertise for waters at the University of Dundee&#8212;which, henceforth, I will refer to as CREW&#8212;to consider the effect of the changes to the flood insurance market in the face of the joint agreement or statement of principles coming to an end, which we know will happen unless the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the ABI and the devolved Administrations reach agreement. I remind Parliament that financial services&#8212;in this case, we are talking about insurance&#8212;are a reserved matter.</p><p>In its research, CREW sought to assess the prices that are currently paid for flood insurance in those areas in Scotland that are potentially vulnerable to flooding; to establish the likely impact of the agreement coming to an end this summer; to identify those communities in Scotland that are most likely to be affected and determine whether particular households would be affected by changes in the availability of insurance and cost; and to undertake a survey to identify trends and hold workshops to explore emerging issues in much more detail.</p><p>CREW&#8217;s report, &#8220;Flood Insurance Provision and Affordability Beyond the Statement of Principles: Implications for Scotland&#8221;, was published in July last year. I draw Parliament&#8217;s attention to a number of the points that it made. CREW&#8217;s research found that the statement of principles confirmed that there was substantial cross-subsidising of insurance in flood risk areas. The insurance body confirmed that the flood risk in England and Wales was significantly greater than the flood risk in Scotland. ABI UK-wide figures indicated that the amount of cross-subsidy from households that are not in the significant risk zone to those that are could be as much as &#163;430 per household.</p><p>CREW also found that policyholders do not know how much they are being charged to provide any cross-subsidy, as the information that is held on risk is not publicly available. CREW expected that transparency for the public would improve with the publication of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#8217;s flood hazard and flood risk maps. That was due to happen during 2013, but it has now slipped to the end of the year. A flood risk management plan is to be available by 2015.</p><p>Once again, it will be people on low incomes, the elderly and those in non-homeowner households who are likely to suffer particular potential difficulties in meeting the extra insurance costs that might well be passed on once the existing agreement comes to an end, regardless of what form its successor might take. As someone who lived in the south-east of the UK some 10 years ago, when council tax was subsidised by flood grants to Thames valley councils, I am sure that people there will have little truck with concerns such as those that I have expressed.</p><p>The insurance industry might allow homeowners to continue with their existing insurance temporarily after 30 June 2013, but their cover could be qualified in several ways. It appears that one of the problems was that the industry had difficulty accessing information on the Scottish flood defence asset database that it could use for commercial purposes so that it could apply premiums more cogently and more appropriately. That data is relevant and is of importance, and lack of access to it is of concern. Perhaps the minister will be able to allay that concern.</p><p>The committee was told that not having access to that data made it more difficult for insurers to compare risk in Scotland with that in England and Wales, where a commercial licence had already been agreed with the Environment Agency that allowed insurers to use data to establish more applicable and fairer premiums. The committee was very disappointed to note that a similar licence had not yet been agreed for Scotland, which meant that insurers could not replicate the fairer and more applicable premium indicator in Scotland.</p><p>The committee was advised that SEPA had written to all local authorities seeking permission to share the data that was filed on the database with all stakeholders, including the insurers. When agreed, that data would be released to the insurance industry so that more applicable and fairer premiums could be set. The plan was set for the end of March, but by mid-April&#8212;surprise, surprise&#8212;there was no agreement to release the data, because three of our local authorities had not responded to SEPA&#8217;s request. I assure those councils that when the Public Petitions Committee seeks information and data we do not do it for fun but as part of our duty to petitioners. A bit more courtesy and timeliness in meeting our requests are anticipated henceforth.</p><p>The minister has confirmed the further work that the Government has done and is doing through implementation of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009, the Reservoirs (Scotland) Act 2011 and the national flood risk assessment plan regarding large-scale flood protection schemes in communities across Scotland. That is good and welcome, but the committee and I suggest that time is running out. We may be at something of an impasse, but options for the replacement of the statement of principles need urgent consideration; in fact, they need urgent implementation and agreement if flood insurance in the UK&#8212;particularly in Scotland&#8212;is to be available, affordable and proportionate. I am anxious that we engage with the industry on its proposed flood re scheme&#8212;a not-for-profit flood insurance fund that could deliver a real choice for consumers in Scotland.</p><p>It is paramount that we deal with the issues of cross-subsidy, accurate assessment of flood risk and availability of data to insurers if we are to reduce the anxieties and the financial burden that hang like a dark cloud over some of our very vulnerable households and communities.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the views of my colleagues across the chamber in what should be a constructive and important debate.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes petition PE1441 in the name of David Crichton on the issue of flood insurance problems; welcomes the petitioner&#8217;s efforts to highlight what it considers to be an important matter, and commends the issues raised in the petition to the Scottish Government for further consideration.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer&#8212;and I noted your hesitation before you said &#8220;14 minutes&#8221;.

We have our wee bits of intrigue&#8212;cosmetic or otherwise&#8212;and we will argue over the impoverishment or the partiality of sections of it but, nationally and locally, the press in Scotland is generally responsible.</p><p>We have to put that responsibility in the context of the foundations of the Leveson inquiry. Only 0.19 per cent of all transactions with private investigators that the UK Information Commissioner investigated involved a Scottish publication. That does not mean that we should be complacent, but nor does it mean that we should abrogate our responsibilities under the charter proposals, with the support of Scots law, to adopt the proposed changes to buttress the consequences and effects of digital technology and economic pressures on the competitive instincts of the press. Indeed, those pressures have as much impact on the local and regional press as they do on the national media&#8212;they are a bit more suppressed, but nevertheless they are there.</p><p>Nor should we be blind to the poverty of the political and press regime down south&#8212;and this is not a constitutional point. The temple that is London&#8212;and I worked in the city for two years&#8212;has pillars of greed and avarice. The bubble of the bonus culture, with results achieved at any cost, is gnawing away at the very fibres of an open, transparent society. Just like the bankers and the expense-hungry politicos, the press is a totem of a behaviour that should be alien in Scotland and in the UK, yet we are already seeing the self-serving senior few&#8212;and it is only a few in the press&#8212;arise, just as the few self-serving bankers did in banking just before them.</p><p>If we look at the press&#8217;s response to the proposed royal charter, we see that the Press Complaints Commission poodle is to be transformed into a bigger and better-shorn poodle, warmed by a regulatory coat.

When so many people face draconian welfare cuts through the Westminster Government&#8217;s policies, Scottish councils should be marshalling their resources and doing all that they can to abate the effects of those cuts.</p><p>In the face of squeezed budgets, the Scottish Government continues to introduce a more efficient public service across the service spectrum. Reducing duplication through effective shared services is a critical means of achieving that. Examples include the single police force, the single fire service and reviews of information and communication technology systems capabilities.</p><p>The integration of health and social care is designed to continue to improve care services, making them much more customer sensitive and efficient and, thereby, challenging the cost base.</p><p>East Ayrshire Council, in its submission to the third strand of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee&#8217;s inquiry, highlighted the need for</p><p>&#8220;a partnership approach to outcomes based planning and a move from reactive to preventative services.&#8221;</p><p>Central to achieving a partnership approach will be effective links with training agencies, cohesive development of performance management systems and, above all, increased involvement of the innovative third sector, which is critical to the delivery of many preventative spend measures.</p><p>Local development plans should be part of a joined-up effort across the public sector to deliver local economic planning in terms of not just geography but best practice and efficiency. One way in which we can make a fundamental change is to ensure that there is consistency in the agreed targets and outcomes for not just local authority chief executives and senior officers but those in similar positions in the health service, the police, the fire service and so on. We need to move towards a system in which senior management pay is much more closely linked to responsibility and performance and the outcomes that are used to measure performance are much more transparent.</p><p>In a new Scotland, we should consider the continuation of reform. Change is a constant and we will need to continue to look at reforms. In Ayrshire, the three councils already co-operate on tourism, for example, and other sectors might benefit from a much more joined-up approach. To ensure that we deliver public services as efficiently as possible, we must not be afraid to look constructively at the service provision and structure of our local authorities and other sectors, and to consider further community empowerment. We should identify where changes can be made to ensure optimisation of economies of scale.</p><p>By reducing duplication across sectors and between the Scottish Government, non-governmental bodies, local authorities and communities, we can, notwithstanding budget constraints, continue to improve public services and protect the sick, the elderly, the young and the vulnerable. South Ayrshire Council&#8217;s motto is &#8220;Ne&#8217;er forget the people.&#8221; Presiding Officer, we will not.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684930", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Services Reform (Developing New Ways of Delivering Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Government opened its submission to the Christie commission by stating: &#8220;Effective and efficient public services are essential to our economic development and to our continuing prosperity.&#8221; Against a backdrop of Westminster cuts to Scotland&#8217;s budget, public sector reform is critical, particularly where it applies to the vulnerable, the young, the elderly and the...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Chic", "last_name": "Brodie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80528", "house": "4", "member_id": "80528", "person_id": "25077", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "South Scotland"}, "section_id": "22684930", "hpos": "94", "gid": "2013-02-26.5.27", "epobject_id": "22684957", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-02-26.5.0&amp;s=speaker%3A25077+section%3Asp#g5.27", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80528"}, {"body": "<p>Will the member take an intervention?</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy Targets"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Will the member take an intervention?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Chic", "last_name": "Brodie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80528", "house": "4", "member_id": "80528", "person_id": "25077", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "South Scotland"}, "section_id": "22684775", "hpos": "176", "gid": "2013-02-21.18.15", "epobject_id": "22684790", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-02-21.18.0&amp;s=speaker%3A25077+section%3Asp#g18.15", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80528"}, {"body": "<p>Will the member take an intervention?</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy Targets"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Will the member take an intervention?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Chic", "last_name": "Brodie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80528", "house": "4", "member_id": "80528", "person_id": "25077", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "South Scotland"}, "section_id": "22684775", "hpos": "179", "gid": "2013-02-21.18.18", "epobject_id": "22684793", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-02-21.18.0&amp;s=speaker%3A25077+section%3Asp#g18.18", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80528"}, {"body": "<p>Will the member take an intervention?</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy Targets"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Will the member take an intervention?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Chic", "last_name": "Brodie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80528", "house": "4", "member_id": "80528", "person_id": "25077", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "South Scotland"}, "section_id": "22684775", "hpos": "215", "gid": "2013-02-21.18.54", "epobject_id": "22684829", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2013-02-21.18.0&amp;s=speaker%3A25077+section%3Asp#g18.54", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80528"}, {"body": "<p>I welcome the&#8212;almost&#8212;consensuality of the debate. The committee&#8217;s inquiry explored whether the Government&#8217;s renewable energy targets are achievable; the report proves that they are.</p><p>Before I start on the meat of my speech, I offer my thanks to past and present committee members, to the convener&#8212;who was not poor&#8212;and to the 87 witnesses who gave evidence. The committee received 183 submissions and 21 items of supplementary evidence and it visited Orkney, Caithness, Perth and Fife in producing the report, which took 11 months to prepare. It was more like &#8220;War and Peace&#8221;; we had a few skirmishes but, in general, the whole thing was a constructive team effort.</p><p>The debate has added constructively to the report. In support of that, the committee welcomes the Government&#8217;s route map for renewable energy and the good practice wind project, from which the good practice guide has now been published. Those documents will add to the report&#8217;s findings, as will the briefings that have been received from many professionals in the industry.</p><p>A significant proportion of the committee&#8217;s time&#8212;perhaps a disproportionate amount&#8212;was spent on onshore wind. However, the significance of having a balanced energy supply from various sources was recognised, as was the need to consider how best to reduce domestic and transport energy demand and to secure our low carbon emissions targets.</p><p>After full consideration, the general summation is that Scotland will achieve its renewables targets for electricity and heat. It is hoped that the positive recommendations in the report will be accepted. I believe that the Government has recognised them in its positive response to the report.</p><p>Many members talked about planning issues, which I will touch on because planning is a key element in achieving the targets. How do we ease the planning process and the guidelines that planning authorities provide? The increased number of planning applications is largely, but not wholly, born of the past subsidy regime&#8217;s suggested favouring of single turbine applications. Hydro and small biomass applications will, in time, add to that. That is why we welcome the recent funding and fees measures that the Government has taken to address resource obstacles. We need to understand, through regular reporting by local authorities, where we are on scoping, planning and approvals.</p><p>As the convener said, the committee felt that, if increased fees for larger-scale planning applications were applied, it would not be unreasonable to expect planning authorities to improve their efficiency by taking on at the centre the job of collecting and gathering data on cumulative and environmental impacts. That, I believe, will help to take some wind and heat out of local disputes.</p><p>Although a number of studies demonstrate that the majority of Scots support the development of onshore and offshore wind, we recognise that there has to be much greater involvement of, communication with and investment by communities, so that we get a balanced view on planning approvals. Guidelines, understanding and practice in, between and across planning authorities and bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage need to be better established and applied.</p><p>As Margaret McDougall and Ken Macintosh mentioned, a major gating factor to achieving our targets is the availability and take-up of requisite skills&#8212;particularly in STEM subjects, as the minister mentioned. The interchangeability of skills requirements and competition for skills between the renewables industry and the still-burgeoning oil and gas industry provide a challenge to be met. I am encouraged by the engagement between the Scottish Government, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council and the energy skills partnership, which is critical to overcoming that challenge and is welcome. However, the demographic demand requires much greater involvement of teachers and parents, who need to be actually taken out to the industry to be shown that engineering, for example, is not a dirty industry.</p><p>Scotland is leading the way on technology through EMEC and the European offshore wind deployment centre and it can establish a skilled workforce that will give the country global reach in the renewables industry.</p><p>Finance was briefly mentioned by Marco Biagi, and certainly by Mary Scanlon. The committee recognises that when the relevant technologies are developed, and with them the potential for a higher proportion of tidal and offshore wave power, Scotland could secure up to &#163;46&#160;billion of investment and nearly 40,000 jobs in renewables by 2020. There are, however, some uncertainties, as has been said. The greatest financial challenge that we face is the uncertainty that is created by DECC and Westminster regarding the lack of clarity on ROCs to 2014, the currently apparently rudderless passage of EMR and an unsure energy bill.</p><p>Despite the coalition&#8217;s agreement that there would be no subsidy for nuclear power, we heard just this week that the UK Government is now talking about 40-year subsidies for new nuclear stations. That is absolutely disgraceful and will certainly be fought rigorously.</p><p>Although I declare that uncertainty, the committee found no significant evidence that there is no uncertainty due to the current constitutional debate. I take Rhoda Grant&#8217;s point, but in his answer to that point the minister indicated that the Scottish Government is trying to have meaningful conversations with the Westminster Government.</p><p>This has been a good debate. Eight minutes is not enough time to do justice to the time and effort of the witnesses, clerks and committee members.</p><p>The summary of the report is this: in the face of uncertainty, which has certainly been created by the situation at Westminster regarding EMR and the energy bill, I believe that with greater development of decentralised generation; demand reduction; storage; better and fairer interconnections; the involvement and awareness of individuals; and the involvement of communities, local authorities, suppliers, developers and investors, we can and will achieve our renewable electricity, heat and low-carbon emissions targets.</p><p>I hope that the report has contributed seriously to the debate and to securing the energy future of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy Targets"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the&#8212;almost&#8212;consensuality of the debate.

In doing so, I thank the large number of my fellow members of the Scottish Parliament who supported the motion. I pay tribute to the friends of Seafield house, some of whom are here tonight and whose acknowledged motivation and enthusiasm to secure Seafield house&#8217;s future were easy prompts for me to bring forward this debate. Although I will dwell on Seafield house in Ayr, I am confident that my colleagues who speak tonight will bring their passion and concerns and their understandable parochialism to demonstrate that, across Scotland, historic houses and buildings play a vital role in preserving our rich history and play an active part in our lives today. Indeed, our present and our future are rooted in our past.</p><p>Before I expand on that, I say that, in my personal lexicon, there is no such thing as a coincidence. Today, we debate in front of our Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, who I believe was raised in sight of Seafield house; today is the 100th anniversary of the death of Sir William Arrol, an iconic Scots engineer; and today we watch the progress of a new Forth bridge.</p><p>There are many bridges between Scotland&#8217;s past, present and future; between our icons of the past and their legacies and memories to be enjoyed today and in future. Burns and Scott and their poetry and literature, and Fleming and penicillin, are just a few examples. Tonight, I bring another to the chamber: Sir William Arrol, one of history&#8217;s greatest civil engineering contractors. I bring his legacies and I appeal for the secure future of his home, Seafield house in Ayr.</p><p>I like to think that William Arrol was, early last century, an archetypal Scot: driven, ambitious, and an unadulterated innovator and entrepreneur. Apparently, he was also a nice man. He was a Liberal unionist but you cannot be perfect in everything. The son of a poor family, at the age of nine he started work as a bobbin maker in a cotton mill in Johnstone. At 14, he became an apprentice blacksmith, rising to the level of foreman in Laidlaw&#8217;s boiler works in Glasgow. Still he pushed on. Having discovered his love of heavy engineering and bridge building, he created Dalmarnock iron works in 1887. One of his first challenges was building the Caledonian Railway Company bridge over the Clyde at Bothwell. The bridge was built on land and then rolled over the river&#8212;a new technique in bridge building, using new tools that Arrol had devised. The next bridge that he built was over the River Clyde at the Broomielaw.</p><p>I say this sadly as a Dundonian but, in 1879, the rail bridge over the River Tay collapsed, sending a train crashing into the river and killing 75 people. The event was immortalised in a poem by the great William McGonagall. Although Sir Thomas Bouch designed and built that fateful bridge, because of that event, Sir William Arrol took over responsibility for designing and building a new rail bridge over the Tay while he was working on plans for a new Forth rail bridge. Those iconic structures are still standing today, as is the famous London tower bridge, which he designed and built. To follow were bridges over the Nile, the Hawkesbury bridge in Australia and the Arrol gantry, the largest crane of its type at the time, which was constructed in Belfast to help the construction of three new super liners, one of which was the Titanic.</p><p>Not 2 miles from the cottage of our national bard, Robert Burns, lies Seafield house, the home of the aforementioned William Arrol, of whom the provost of Ayr said at his funeral, exactly 100 years ago today:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland has lost one of her most distinguished sons.&#8221;</p><p>Set in 50 acres of land running down to the seafront at Ayr, the grand lady that is Seafield house stands proud, with her magnificent Italianate tower appointed like a parasol. A grande dame, she was adorned by a magnificent library, a large and beautiful hall, a rich collection of art and so much more. Not only did she look good but she performed well, after Sir William&#8217;s death, as a hospital for wounded soldiers in the first world war.</p><p>In October 1921, she became, appropriately, a maternity and children&#8217;s hospital. Just as appropriately, from 1944 she served as a renowned paediatric hospital for 47 years before becoming the headquarters of Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board. Despite her beauty and service, she succumbed to fire in 2008. It is time to restore her to her former beauty and service.</p><p>Patrick Lorimer, the architectural adviser to the friends of Seafield house said:</p><p>&#8220;Not only is the building iconic in the light of its original owner it is also a critical and vital element within the historic landscape of this unique part of Ayr; it should and can be rescued.&#8221;</p><p>Andrew Arrol, one of the two patrons of the friends of Seafield house, said:</p><p>&#8220;In my view Seafield House can certainly be saved. It is very well built of good durable materials and potentially has many years of life ahead of it.&#8221;</p><p>I applaud the positive approach of the Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board, Historic Scotland and the council and the determination and positive approach of the friends of Seafield house towards saving and then rebuilding that iconic structure. That would, indeed, be a fitting tribute to our past and a world-renowned Scottish engineer.

That action implies more rigour and, perhaps, due diligence in considering the performance of creditors or potential creditors, with a slowing down of the cycle of cash flow.</p><p>Increasing, punitive debt can disrupt that cycle through bankruptcy&#8212;the threat of which is now, happily, through the improved scheme less likely. Although creditors are still entitled to take action to enforce payment under voluntary debt payment programmes, the debt arrangement scheme provides real additional security. Individual debtors are responsible, I believe, for their own indebtedness, just as creditors are responsible for their diligence, risk assessment and credit provision. However, in these straitened times, when there is unintended debt liability, the Government has a responsibility to provide mechanisms to protect both debtor and bona fide creditors. I believe that the improved scheme will do that, and I am pleased to support it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684051", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Debt Arrangement Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is surely a sign of the times that, last week, we discussed payday loans and, this week, we are discussing the debt arrangement scheme.

Yesterday, chairing the cross-party group on social enterprise, I heard of the dramatic increase in referrals to housing association advice centres, which are referrals of not the unemployed, the disabled or others, but those in work.</p><p>Those and similar situations do not make me sad; they make me angry. The Pontius Pilate proposal by Alex Johnstone that some people are not being made slaves to the draconian and misguided fiscal, economic and benefits policies of Westminster is absolute nonsense. The Conservatives should be ashamed.</p><p>The immediate suppression of income and benefits further drives people towards very expensive payday loans, which in some cases are for paying off earlier loans. I understand the restriction imposed on the Scottish Government by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and I support the SNP amendment&#8217;s aim to change the laws, but I believe that, in the short term, there might be another way to mitigate, if not expunge, the loans challenge.</p><p>The users of short-term loans in some parts of the US, Canada and Australia face similar issues of affordability, multiple loans, the cycle of debt caused by taking new loans and the rolling over of existing loans. Australia has already legislated to subvert excessive-interest loans, as have some US states. For example, in Florida, one can borrow only to a maximum of $500 through a payday loan; there are limited transaction fees; the rolling over of loans has been banned; and loan terms have been restricted to a maximum of 31 days&#8212;that should be our objective.</p><p>Some US states and parts of Canada use customised regulatory systems that protect customers while allowing registered payday and short-term lenders to operate profitably, but within reason. There is also a software solution operated by a company called Veritech that allows customer data to be shared among lenders so that a customer&#8217;s maximum borrowing limit is known to all lenders at any one moment in time, which means that the borrower cannot exceed their borrowing limit by hopping from one lender to another on the same day. The software also allows the restriction of loans, ensures that there is no borrowing during the repayment plan period and allows reasonable fee structures for responsible lending, which is what we should do, preferably through credit unions.</p><p>In supporting its amendment, I ask the Government at least to investigate the possibility of a partnership with credit unions and to look at the Veritech solution or similar solutions in order to counter the ravages of open-ended, non-self-regulated lending.

She must know that two thirds of applications to the reporters on wind turbines are overturned in favour of the local authority, so I hope that next time she comes to the chamber to debate energy policy, she will have the facts right.</p><p>In October, an article stated that Scotland&#8217;s Minister for Local Government and Planning is not messing about and, in his quiet way, is driving a wholesale reform of Scotland&#8217;s planning system, collaborating and working in partnership with stakeholders and communities to achieve an effective planning system for Scotland. I want to compare that with an even more recent press release from south of the border, where Messrs Pickles and Boles threaten to strip councils of planning powers and centralise them in a planning inspectorate, and where words such as &#8220;civil war&#8221;, &#8220;alarm&#8221;, &#8220;bombshell&#8221; and &#8220;override&#8221; abound. Those words have no place in the lexicon of a revised planning network. The Scottish minister&#8217;s much more collaborative and democratic approach is to be welcomed. Scotland, again, is different.</p><p>Although I welcome the proposed planning policy and the establishment of a revised national planning framework, we must ensure that all parts of the process not only contribute to the nation&#8217;s economic growth but fit in with our vision of a physical Scotland and the strategic role of not just our cities and large towns but our smaller communities and the role that they will play in that vision.</p><p>In setting out the spatial dimensions of our major strategic priorities, communities and community empowerment must play a complementary part. The report on renewables that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee published in December indicated and crystallised that demand. Community involvement must be part of the jigsaw, and any plan-led system must ensure that development plans, be they strategic or local economic plans, have a consistent approach to national policy and guidelines across rural and urban developments.</p><p>Two examples compound this. First, in Ayrshire we have a joint Ayrshire planning group, which is the interface between the Scottish Government and councils, but each of the three councils has its own economic development plan, and they do not necessarily hang together. It may well be that a vision of a future local authority infrastructure and organisation is key to the success of our future planning network. The question must be asked: for a small nation, do we have too many local authorities to ensure the efficiency of the planning network?</p><p>Secondly, when the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee discussed and promoted its report on renewables, a key element of success was seen as being the timely delivery of local authority spatial development plans and the SNH planning guidelines to complement our national targets.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681369", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I get to the meat of my speech I note that, although I thought that the pantomime season was over, we still have the Tory energy policy pantomime, probably with Struan Stevenson and Murdo Fraser as the ugly sisters.

Why ask a national organisation such as SNH to produce guidelines that have not been followed in some areas? That, combined with the mechanism that was introduced for feed-in tariffs and renewables obligations certificates, led to a proliferation of applications for single turbines, which placed an uneven burden on some planning departments. From the beginning, it would have made more sense to have defined community equity participation in wind farm developments of an appropriate size so that the defined community would be a beneficiary of direct involvement in the planning and production process and, ultimately, of the financial benefits that would flow therefrom, rather than be seduced by embellishments and inducements pre-planning.</p><p>The uneven burden on planners is not just caused by single wind turbine applications; it will be increased by, for example, town regeneration projects. It needs a strong performance measurement mechanism and revenue-generating function and one has to ask whether a ring-fenced revenue-generating&#8212;indeed, profit-generating&#8212;planning function within councils should be created and developed.</p><p>Whether or not we have reduced councils, securing major projects in line with local economic development plans, which are then a significant part of a national planning framework, is absolutely critical.

I have the advantage of Mr Macintosh in that I was at the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee yesterday. On page 3 of his report to the committee, Professor Bell stated:</p><p>&#8220;the claimant count is no longer the accepted measure of unemployment.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;the growth in unemployment rates since the beginning of the current recession ... has been relatively modest&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>certainly a lot better for us than for all our European counterparts.</p><p>And so the numbers game goes on. Mrs Scanlon is not here&#8212;she is probably rehearsing the next set of numbers outside. We talk about numbers around colleges, housing, the modern apprenticeship scheme and so on. Opposition members say&#8212;without evidence&#8212;that those are all threatened, which will exacerbate the position of the young unemployed. We have a duty&#8212;an obligation on all sides of the chamber&#8212;to say not just what we are against, but what we are for and how we will pay for it. Do we find the level of youth unemployment acceptable? Of course we do not. However, let us debate and quantify what else might be done in the context and the consequences of the resources that are made available to us.</p><p>As Mr Macintosh said, David Bell highlighted the fact that unemployment creates permanent scars rather than temporary blemishes. In the face of that, most of us accept that, in the current economic circumstances, the minister and the Government are laying out plans to mitigate that as best we can in the economic circumstances. From opportunities for all to the record number of modern apprenticeships, and from employer recruitment incentives to activity agreements, community jobs for Scotland and so on, there is a plethora&#8212;as Annabelle Ewing said&#8212;of programmes to encourage young people into training or work. Maybe there are too many, but I welcome the make young people your business programme, which I believe is very sensible. I mentioned earlier the need for us to start to think outside the box.</p><p>Had fiscal circumstances been different, and they will be, the easier action would have been to create more demand in the economy&#8212;hence our cri de coeur, very often, for a significant stimulus on capital investment in the economy. However, our circumstances are not different, and never will be, in the job market; tomorrow will never be the same as yesterday in the job market. That is why I believe that we must have a fundamental change&#8212;a seismic shift&#8212;and give businesses, particularly a significant proportion of the 335,000 SMEs in Scotland, not just finance but business support and experience to encourage them to take on help and to employ young people, to build their skills and, in the process, to build those businesses. That is also why I believe in creating an entrepreneurial spirit coupled to community empowerment through social enterprise and the third sector. That means us evangelising and taking the message out to the young in the communities in the cities and the countryside.</p><p>I believe that, once we have our hands on the levers of fiscal management, we will be able to consider things such as pensions and other provisions so that people can leave the working population earlier to promote the skilling up of the young and allow the more mature to skill down. Given our economic strategy and focus, the harsh reality is that we must invest in our young. Although I support the initiatives that have been taken to date, it is time to take the power and responsibility to seek to tip the balance of decision making in favour of young people. Our young must be inspired to aspire&#8212;they are the future.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681238", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The member reminds me of the pessimist who sees the difficulty in every opportunity, whereas the optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.

We are all aware of the current stress on families, our communities and in the country that has been caused by the economic straits that we are in. To exacerbate that stress by exercising some sort of visceral, or even cosmetic, tribalism serves no purpose at all. We should leave the &#8220;Oh yes we can&#8221;, &#8220;Oh no you can&#8217;t&#8221; to another place; let us clearly and cogently discuss the committee&#8217;s report and debate our spending priorities.</p><p>I know that our priorities are clearly different from those of the Opposition, but I say in all honestly to Opposition members that, as Mark McDonald said, it is incumbent on them to spell out their alternative budget plans and how they would address the issues in the committee&#8217;s report. If the Opposition aspires to reduce or increase the cost or revenue elements in the budget, or to change the recommendations in the report, it is necessary for it to tell Parliament&#8212;and, indeed, the electors&#8212;exactly what it would increase or reduce as an alternative. Those decisions should then be judged in terms of their employment impact, investment returns and effect on long-term sustainable economic growth.</p><p>To assist in that, I agree with the recommendation in paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Finance Committee&#8217;s report that there should be some technical changes to the presentation and formatting of future budgets. We need clarity and consistency of terminology, just as we need a bridging analysis from one year to another, so that we can compare each of the proposed budget lines to those of the previous year&#8217;s budget and to the likely outturn, with appropriate statements aligned to major itemised changes. The draft budget would then lend itself to more discussion around principles and policies rather than the batting of sometimes confusing numbers all over the place.</p><p>I support the committee&#8217;s report and, in general, the cabinet secretary&#8217;s budget. I do not do so blindly, because I have to compare its purpose and objectives with those of the UK budget which had&#8212;until the UK Government&#8217;s autumn statement conversion&#8212;no plan to balance investing in jobs with accelerating the opportunity to pay down its massive deficit and borrowing.</p><p>I am also supportive for other reasons; I will give three examples. First, I received a letter two weeks ago from an outgoing college principal who declared quite clearly that she and her colleagues are particularly anxious to embrace the exciting future plans that we have for colleges. That is not something that we hear often in the chamber.</p><p>Secondly, on Monday I attended a meeting of the Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board&#8217;s review board. The head of nursing, when asked about the shortage of nurses, said that there is no such shortage and that she is operating within budget. Thirdly, we have a council that had an underspend of &#163;3.8&#160;million. Although there may be some doubt about competency over the latter, there is little question, even when recognising the seriousness of the situation and the short-term implications that we face, that the people of Scotland have accepted the need for innovation, change and efficiency, as is reflected in the committee report. It is important that in a recent YouGov poll more than 60 per cent of Scots agreed&#8212;24 per cent disagreed&#8212;that we should be able to invest money in the short term on capital projects so that we pay down the deficit more quickly than will the austerity regime that has been adopted by the UK Government.</p><p>In more specific terms, in these straightened times, the establishment and maintenance of business confidence, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises and in the third sector, is critical to our medium and long-term sustainable economic growth. Although the report&#8212;as I do&#8212;welcomes the fact that the budget will maintain spend in cash terms, the Finance Committee&#8217;s invitation to the Government to respond to issues about access to risk capital and seed funding is particularly welcome. Those sectors are the engines of future growth. They need to secure their future, and critical to that is financial and business support.</p><p>I welcome the Finance Committee&#8217;s report and its constructive questions and recommendations. Difficulties mastered are opportunities won, and I am sure that all of us in our approach to the budget and the nation&#8217;s financial wellbeing will be constructive.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the tone of today&#8217;s debate on what is a good Finance Committee report.

I was one of those who sat through the meeting with the UK minister, Esther McVey, on 22 October, at which we called for a full independent review to be carried out of the stage 1 Remploy closures before the stage 2 closure plan was embarked on. That call was ignored; indeed, it was not even acknowledged. Therein lies not just the stupidity but the crassness of the UK Government. A duty of care has been abandoned, and there has been monumental business and governmental incompetence.</p><p>I will come on to the latter in a while. All that I will say for now is that anyone who makes an announcement in which she says that she does not intend to delay stage 2 as she feels that to do so may weaken the business does not understand business. I know from my business experience that such a statement weakens the business&#8217;s viability and would make any potential customer or buyer wonder, &#8220;Why the rush?&#8221;</p><p>This farce&#8212;this circus&#8212;has been a smokescreen to cover up the UK Government&#8217;s intention, come what may, to shut down our Remploy factories, which it says were losing &#163;68 million a year, although that figure is disputable, and to throw disabled workers into unemployment, which will result in them costing as much, if not more, through unemployment and disability benefits and the need for treatment of hastened illnesses and anxiety.</p><p>This farce&#8212;this circus&#8212;became a totem for the UK Government when it put Liz Sayce, the chief executive officer of the disability rights group, Radar, in charge of the Remploy review. As someone said at the time, &#8220;It was like putting a vegetarian in charge of a review of a meat factory.&#8221; It was inevitable that a review by someone who is a mental health expert rather than a business expert would come up with the recommendation that UK Government funding should be directed at supporting more disabled people into mainstream employment. If the Government, through its access to work scheme, and Radar are so good at that, why is it the case that 85 per cent of the Remploy employees who were made redundant four to five years ago are still unemployed?</p><p>The present situation magnifies the UK Government&#8217;s manifest incompetence when it comes to understanding business and, in particular, small business entities such as Remploy. Everything that has happened has happened because the UK Government has starved Remploy companies of strong local sales and marketing resource, and has burdened them with huge central non-productive and sales overheads.</p><p>At stage 1 of the process, 36 out of 54 Remploy factories&#8212;four of which were in Scotland&#8212;were designated for closure unnecessarily, because of an inability to understand the structures of a business sale that led to the closing off of the bids involved in the process. That in itself requires serious investigation. Under stage 2, another 18 factories&#8212;five of which are in Scotland&#8212;will go through another spurious exercise, unless the lessons of stage 1 are thoroughly learned and accepted and lead to change.</p><p>However, all is not lost. I have had regular and constant contact with bidders and particularly with Redrock, which the minister mentioned, and I can advise members that one of the 36 factories escaped. The factory in Wigan escaped, months after closure. A phoenix has risen from the ashes there, and a former Remploy factory now employs 16 of the 18 disabled former Remploy employees. Who knows? The road to Wigan pier might carry on all the way up to Scotland. I am confident that the Scottish Government will work with associated bodies in Scotland to optimise the opportunities that will arise.</p><p>I return to Einstein, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I&#8217;m not sure about the universe.&#8221;</p><p>Let us continue to challenge the nonsense that was the Remploy stage 1 exercise.

yesterday I visited the National Assembly for Wales, which was also, coincidentally, debating the effect of APD on tourism. There is no doubt that APD&#8212;along with VAT, the lack of direct flights and the visa shambles&#8212;militates against success in tourism generally and business tourism particularly and defies some of the good work that our tourism agencies do.</p><p>Talking with some Chinese businessmen recently, I was appalled to be told that, when seven of them applied to come to Scotland on business, the embassy restricted their quota to five. Of course, none of them then came. Notwithstanding the consensual nature of the debate, I have to admit that I smiled yesterday when reading the story about Areva coming to Scotland, on which the Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, said:</p><p>&#8220;I am determined that Britain competes and thrives in the global race&#8221;.</p><p>Well, he could help our business tourism by asking his Chancellor of the Exchequer to reduce APD and VAT drastically, by asking his Foreign Secretary to sort out the visa shambles and by asking his Secretary of State for Transport to insist that the transport review considers direct flights to Scotland.</p><p>Having worked for several multinationals and run eight companies across Europe, I know that it is critical to business tourism that we increase the global corporate footprint in Scotland. We need more corporate headquarters. On that, I can only praise the great work of Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Development International and the efforts that they have made so far to attract such companies. I have no doubt that, under the umbrella of the strategic economic forum, there will be even greater co-ordination and cohesion among Scottish Enterprise, SDI and VisitScotland in attracting more businesses&#8212;and, by default, more business tourists&#8212;to Scotland.</p><p>In my careers with NCR, IBM, Digital, Wang UK and Tandem UK, I well remember the influx of colleagues from the US, Japan and Europe, many of whom brought their spouses and extended their stays, and even continued to come back after they had left the companies. I well remember Tandem taking over a third of Gleneagles hotel. I do not remember quite as well the night at the Tullibardine distillery, although I am sure I enjoyed it. The attraction of corporates and their subsidiary units and manufacturing entities must be an overarching objective for business and business tourism. As it was in silicon glen, let it be in renewables, food and drink, and life sciences.</p><p>We must build on the estimated &#163;900 million of expenditure from business tourism in 2011, which was 19 per cent of total tourism expenditure. Aside from the volume, the business tourism sector is important because it is estimated that business tourists spend one and a half times what leisure tourists spend. It is important that we have in place the processes and information and communication technology systems that crystallise the numbers, so that we know exactly how we are growing.</p><p>As the minister said, our success is contingent on the joint work of VisitScotland&#8217;s business tourism unit, our universities, local authorities, regional tourism forums and the private sector to stimulate activity and build infrastructure to meet our national objective. Although I applaud the current 53 applications to the conference bid fund and I recognise the efforts of Glasgow City Council and Scott Taylor and his marketing team in securing outstanding conferences for Glasgow, particularly in the life sciences and medicine, I suggest that our business tourism cannot be city-centric only and nor can it be product-centric. According to the business tourism unit, outside the main cities, only 31 places in Scotland can seat more than 500 people in theatre style.</p><p>We will be successful in our pursuit of making Scotland a global business tourism centre for the corporates that I mentioned, for conferences, conventions, sales achievement programmes, exhibitions and trade fairs&#8212;I could go on&#8212;only if we are ready to beat the global competition. That means spreading our reach to show our service worth, natural resources and assets, including outwith the cities. It means increasing connectivity and business tourism attractions in the Borders and the Highlands and Islands. The phrase that comes to mind is, &#8220;Shovel ready, service ready.&#8221; We have good and, in some cases, excellent tourism and business tourism agencies.

Important selective exemptions&#8212;but not too many&#8212;from disclosure should, of course, protect only essential Government functions, including international diplomacy, defence, personal information or specific confidential advice. I support Bruce Crawford&#8217;s earlier comments about commercial information, which would require a much longer and detailed debate.</p><p>In subscribing to the principles of the bill, it is important that we note that only a small percentage of Scots filed FOI requests last year. Notwithstanding that, it is pertinent that we review and amend an act that is now in its 10th year. It is appropriate to consider changes to the terms of the longevity of a particular historical record, as it is to pursue those who do not provide data by destroying or concealing it; that practice is unacceptable.</p><p>I had been motivated to support the general argument and thrust of the Finance Committee&#8217;s observations about creating too many exemptions, even&#8212;and particularly&#8212;in the case of the Queen and heirs to the throne, but that might defeat the general principles inherent in the original act.</p><p>I refer again to the scope and range of FOI requests, which I mentioned earlier. In particular, that applies to royal communications, which have been barely requested, notwithstanding the current request regarding the heir to the throne. Therefore, I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment to consider the matter appropriately and the fact that the Government will try to seek convergence with the Westminster Government on it for reasons that other members have covered.</p><p>Having recently made an FOI request for data that is some 30 years old and not yet having succeeded in getting it, my initial reaction to the amendment to the power to vary periods for historical records under section 57 of the 2002 act was to oppose the change. However, I endorse the Government&#8217;s intention to amend the lifespan of time-limited exemptions but secure flexibility in certain cases&#8212;including, I hope, mine.</p><p>I also support the Government&#8217;s position on the time limit for proceedings that are brought in cases in which the destruction of data thwarts the seeking of information or the disclosure of data.

I know that he will be a real asset to the ministerial team.</p><p>With your indulgence, Presiding Officer, I approach the debate not just as one of the parliamentary representatives of a large region of Scotland, but as a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee. Let us not forget the key role that the active assets of our rural and agricultural economies play at the heart of Scotland&#8217;s economic wellbeing. As we drive towards meeting our goals of increasing our food and drink exports by 50 per cent over the next five years and achieving our energy, climate change and environmental targets by 2020, it is clear to all in Scotland that a seismic change through CAP reform must be negotiated that works in the favour of Scotland, its farmers and the rural population. That change should be fully recognised in Scotland&#8217;s relationship with Europe and by those who make the decisions on the CAP.</p><p>Alex Fergusson is no longer here, but I was impressed by his articulacy and forcefulness when he agreed that we need to do something for Scotland&#8212;yet still he bends the knee towards talking to the UK Government and Europe, rather than seeking the change that is absolutely necessary for Scotland to achieve its goals. I applaud the efforts that our cabinet secretary has deployed in recognising the clear water of difference that exists between the rural areas of Scotland and the rest of the rural UK. As Rob Gibson said, perhaps Mr Paterson should come&#8212;and come quickly&#8212;to understand what those differences genuinely are.</p><p>Fifty years since the CAP was designed to secure environmental benefits, rural development and the production and distribution of valued food resource, we still have an iniquitous system of financial support for Scottish agriculture.</p><p>We can bemoan the difference in the pace of agricultural change and in efficiency across Europe, particularly the new Europe. We can agree and disagree with some of the concepts around subsidies and with the breadth and width of subsidies and remind everyone that we are nowhere near a convergence of activity across Europe. We can argue against the activities and the large profits of supermarkets that militate against a market-oriented rate of return on investment for our agricultural and rural sectors, as is the case with regard to milk, which has been mentioned. However, how much easier would it be to adopt&#8212;nay, demand&#8212;a greener and fairer share of the UK budget? As I have said, it would be far easier if we were negotiating that at the table of decision.</p><p>Against that backdrop, there has to be a funding mechanism in the 2014 to 2020 round that allows the opportunity for a greater return on investment and assets so that those productive farming assets that can make a greater contribution to our nationally strategic food and drink exporting markets benefit disproportionately.</p><p>Alongside recognising the asset mix, we have to recognise the diversity of our rural and agricultural industries and apportion CAP funding not just geographically but sectorally in order to promote our exports and the foundations of our export industries, whether they are barley, other cereals or, indeed, red meat livestock, for which I understand our Chinese friends are developing an increasing and healthy appetite.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673620", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome my South Scotland colleague, Paul Wheelhouse, to the job of minister.

As has already been referred to, the map is claimed to be the largest outdoor relief map in the world, and I believe that it is the totem for a drama-documentary or even a film. The map was the vision of General Maczek&#8212;a true Polish military hero&#8212;and his friend, Jan Tomasik, which was realised in this 2,000m2, three-dimensional model of our nation.</p><p>The history of the map encompasses a friendship that involves the fall of France and the 10th armoured cavalry brigade of Polish forces being stationed at Barony castle. Those Polish forces were befriended by the Scottish people and were entrusted by the War Office to plan a defence of Scotland&#8217;s east coast during world war two. That defence was based on a map of the Scottish landscape that they developed.</p><p>At that point, history turns to romance. Under the command of the hero, General Maczek, the courageous Polish soldiers, including Maczek and Tomasik, played a significant part in the Normandy landings and the liberation of Europe. However, that was only the start of the romance. Due to the post-war political situation in Poland and the fact that he was a great leader and hero of the people, Maczek found himself&#8212;along with many brave Polish soldiers&#8212;in exile in Scotland.</p><p>Jan Tomasik, who had been billeted at Barony castle, eventually bought the hotel in 1968&#8212;I believe that there is no such thing as coincidence. He then found his friend and wartime commander, the non-pensioned Maczek, working as a barman in Edinburgh. &#192; la Eisenhower and Culzean castle, he took Maczek home and installed him in a suite in Barony castle, and there the two planned a way of ensuring that their wartime strategy map could be remembered in a more permanent form, which resulted in the great Polish map of Scotland that we have today and which we wish to be fully restored in all its glory&#8212;not just as a tourist attraction, but as a testament to the relationship between the Scots and Polish peoples.</p><p>Four minutes can never do justice to the history&#8212;real or romantic&#8212;of the mapa.

He spoke of a cleaner, greener, more sustainable Scotland, and we all support that. I would like to focus on the clean part and indicate the impact that I think it has on the latter two aspects.</p><p>Graeme Dey said that I would mention enhancing the powers in legislation. I have indicated that I might wish to introduce a member&#8217;s bill on litter, because litter is not just a zero waste issue, although working with zero waste Scotland is clearly important. Tackling litter is important in order to further beautify Scotland, but also to increase morale and boost confidence. Renewed action is needed to further preserve and improve Scotland&#8217;s beauty and environment. That will become increasingly important as we approach 2014, given the number of visitors that we anticipate having then.</p><p>The responsibility for clearing litter from Scotland&#8217;s streets and public areas lies with our local authorities, but not just with them; it also lies with us. I do not want to dwell on the obvious opportunities of recycling and waste to energy&#8212;Graeme Dey mentioned those subjects&#8212;but they are important factors. The local authorities are failing in some cases. In some areas, the duties that local authorities were given under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 are manifestly not being met, and neither are the standards in the code of practice on litter and refuse. Given that those standards exist and are considered to be important, we have to ask why they are not being applied and met.</p><p>One can walk down the Canongate and see all over the place black bags that have burst. We had a recent report on Ayr and Stonehaven beaches. A couple of months ago, I did a radio phone-in on litter at West Sound in Ayr, and the number of phone calls that we received was striking. Graeme Dey mentioned people throwing material out of cars while they are driving. I have to say that it is only high-class Y-fronts that we have on the A77, but that is an issue. Fly tipping is unacceptable. We can fine people &#163;40,000 for fly tipping, or put them in prison for six months, but we do not apply the legislation.</p><p>All those things have an impact on health and safety. However, it is not just that. Local problems such as litter, graffiti and dog fouling have major social impacts on wellbeing and quality of life. They define people and communities. There is a clear correlation between the extent of the problem and the nature of the area. Some 44 per cent of people in our most deprived neighbourhoods encounter problems with litter and rubbish, compared with 17 per cent in the most affluent areas. Various other factors and measurements substantiate that point.</p><p>We need action and&#8212;as has been said&#8212;it must be more than just voluntary action. That is why I have talked about introducing a member&#8217;s bill. We must look at awareness raising, education and, regrettably, at penalties. Awareness raising should highlight behavioural change and should focus on the impact on communities, our environment and climate. Although some work has been done on a coastal clean-up, we still have more to do. There must be more education in schools and communities. We must also create enterprises, as has been done in Dundee, where the Clean Close Company has cleaned up a city that used to be recognised by some people as probably the dirtiest in Scotland. It is not now. All those things are required.</p><p>At its heart, Scotland is beautiful. We must now tidy up the body of Scotland.

If I do so with a hint of frustration, it is because I believe that we need to move quickly beyond the consultative phase on community powers and pursue action and change to inspire, revive and renew our communities. In the bill proposal, there is already a wealth of information about what needs to be done or might need to be done in favour of communities and community powers. However, I believe that structure is important too, and it also needs to be considered.</p><p>We have had 10 years of community planning and community planning partnerships. Frankly, I was appalled recently when I looked at the minutes of one CPP meeting&#8212;22 people from all the support services attended. No doubt each was a worthy contributor, but I suggest that a meeting of that size is not conducive to fast responses to community needs and action. One has to ask how one can attain a single outcome, let alone many, with such a large representative body, well meaning and community spirited though each member of that body might be.</p><p>I suggest to the Government that real determination of community needs must be complemented by a wider consultation that ensures and secures meaningful representation of communities on the ground. I do not denigrate the proposals that might be made in the bill, but I want to know what the communities and people want.</p><p>For example, the role of local authorities is not just to serve one community but to serve the different needs and wants of the many and varied communities in their area. If we mean that local authorities facilitate and maintain community planning, including consulting and co-operating with communities, I suggest that we are confusing the local authority management regime with that of the much-needed management of the smaller defined communities within that local authority area. We should be devolving meaningful management, leadership and funding to those communities. It is suggested that real outcomes will be achieved only when we establish quite clear delineation of responsibilities and anticipated outcomes between central Government, local authorities and communities.</p><p>I accept that CPPs have been a qualified but reasonable success, but there has been confusion because they are not standard&#8212;nor should they be&#8212;in their methodology of engaging the range of public bodies and representation of the third and private sectors. There is confusion around how we measure outcomes and the effectiveness of each CPP. Communities the length and breadth of Scotland are different, which is why local communities must be major players and fully consulted on the proposed bill and its powers.</p><p>I think that it was Churchill who said in 1951 that we should &#8220;set the people free&#8221;. I believe that the bill should be about setting communities free and devolving leadership and responsibility to each and every community. It should give them the right to manage and challenge local authorities. As it is today, the structure is too complex because too many of the CPP stakeholders understandably have an eye to their accountabilities at the local authority level.</p><p>The Government should link the bill tangentially, where it can be linked, to the proposed procurement bill, so that communities have more of a say not only in the provision of services to their community, but in buying and in some cases managing those services. The burden on the Government in the proposed bill will hopefully be to encourage, develop and empower community councils. It will give them prominence in funding, budget and asset management, and the design, procurement and delivery of services and facilities to their individual communities. Of course, after the bill is enacted, certain areas will be reserved to local authorities&#8212;housing, education and transport, for example&#8212;but engagement and security of community interest will be achieved only by true devolution of management and leadership of the communities to those who live in and own them.</p><p>The current local authority system is slightly antediluvian and far too wide. The proposed bill will give us a chance to consult on a meaningful local and community service that will meet the aspirations of the people who live in our communities, and our aspirations as a nation.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate on the consultation on the proposed community empowerment and renewal bill.

Of course, I would say that as someone who comes from Ayr and is a golfer. When, at lunchtime, I attended a meeting of the cross-party group on golf, I was delighted to discover that golf itself, which generates &#163;223&#160;million in revenue and supports 4,000 jobs, is to become a specific business sector under the VisitScotland umbrella.</p><p>Not only are we hosting the open, but Scotland itself is open. Last year&#8217;s figures show that although international visits are down, spend is up; that domestic and UK visitors and spend are up; and that, in 2011, there was a 9 per cent increase in overnight visitors and a 14 per cent increase in spend.</p><p>Although we are open now in the summer, we have big campaigns and focused seasonal campaigns, such as winter white, to increase trade in quiet months and show that Scotland is always open for visitor business, all year round.</p><p>Tourism&#8212;the visitor economy&#8212;is a major income sector for Scotland. If one has any doubts about that, I suggest they look at the briefing that we received today from the Scottish Sports Association&#8212;sport being a billion-pound industry in itself. The sector sits in the first division of our economy, along with food and drink, life sciences, renewables, oil and gas, and engineering and manufacturing. &#8220;Destination Scotland&#8221; it is and will be. While we continue to look at the continual improvement processes that allow us to consider our local structures for tourism, the quality of tourism and focused marketing, let there be no doubt that the new tourism strategy&#8212;which is, as has been said, a credit to the TLG&#8212;is a strategy of leadership and growth that shows signs of the inestimable success that we might expect of the sector. Tourism in Scotland, under that leadership strategy, is important because it is the creator of a current annual spend of &#163;4&#160;billion&#8212;a figure that is growing. Compared to tourism in the rest of the UK, tourism in Scotland is a disproportionate contributor that supports 200,000 jobs. It is the harbinger of a large number of jobs in our rural economies, as Mary Scanlon said.</p><p>The major international economic downturn could have set into turmoil our early aspiration&#8212;which was set in vastly different economic circumstances&#8212;to grow the sector by 50 per cent by 2016. However, we continue to succeed in racing to meet substantial growth in visitor business. There is little doubt that over recent years there has been a change in attitude in the sector; a change to a &#8220;can do, will do&#8221; approach. I applaud&#8212;as the minister did&#8212;the Scottish Tourism Alliance and VisitScotland for bringing about that change in attitude.</p><p>I have recently visited tourism organisations in South Scotland where I, too, received an invitation. I was excited to be invited to meet ABBA, until I found out that it was not Benny and the gang who sang &#8220;Waterloo&#8221;, but the Ayrshire Bed and Breakfast Association. It was exciting, just the same.</p><p>Let us welcome the 15.7&#160;million trips to Scotland last year, the 63.1&#160;million nights spent in Scotland and, as I mentioned, the &#163;4&#160;billion-worth of spend in 2011. Let us applaud&#8212;as the minister did&#8212;the leadership of Glasgow and other places in securing much-needed business and conference tourism.</p><p>As I flick through the spring edition of &#8220;EventScotland News&#8221; and look at the many positive headlines, I get somewhat excited; a feeling that is couched alongside pride in what Scotland is doing in the sector. Glasgow is to bid for the 2018 youth Olympic games, the Scottish open championship has announced a new title sponsor, and Glasgow is to host the 2015 international Paralympic swimming championships. We have had the Curtis cup and we will again have Celtic connections. We will also have the European 470 class boat championships at Largs. Today we will have the big concert at Stirling. There is much more going on in Scotland than we have ever seen. All those events are embroidery to the winning years tapestry, which is interwoven with individual, non-packaged holidays.</p><p>The TLG strategy is in place, the challenges and the aspirations have been drawn up and organisations are being improved to underpin them. However, one can imagine how much better all those achievements would be if we were to be released from the yoke of the excessive VAT charges that have been imposed on the sector, freed from the shackles of an antediluvian visa process and released from the pernicious and iniquitous air passenger duty, which is a bolted lock on air travel and a blight on the huge possibilities for airports such as Prestwick international.</p><p>Brand marketing is very important in the tourist industry&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670079", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Visitor Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, I am delighted to speak in this debate, particularly as it comes on the back of yesterday&#8217;s announcement that Royal Troon will once again host the open golf championship in 2016.

That is why we have 35,265 apprenticeships today.</p><p>That said, let us look at the more substantive elements that will marry our young people to economic growth. At university level, as Universities Scotland has stated, employability is already embedded as a core part of the learning and teaching strategies. Companies that have invested, are investing and are reinvesting in Scotland cite the strength of Scotland&#8217;s young graduates as a key factor. Any member who is in doubt about that should ask FMC Technologies, enStratus, State Street or Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and hear them declare that our young graduates are the reason for those companies coming to Scotland.</p><p>The reform of our colleges to focus on supportive learning and training in the industry sectors that dominate our economic strategy&#8212;food and drink, aerospace, engineering, tourism and so on&#8212;is key to the long-term employability of our young people. There has been a shift to an understanding that vocational education is as important an element as a university degree in creating an efficient physical infrastructure to support that economic strategy, yet we still hear complaints. Additionally, programmes such as opportunities for all, get ready for work and training for work and the statement that has been made on Government procurement policies are critical to the foundation of the young in employment.</p><p>I will not rehearse all the funding or beneficially comparative statistics that show that we are in the right direction of travel regarding young people and economic growth. It is not we who currently have our foot on the economic brakes. In these straitened times, which are not of our making, I applaud the wonderful words of Tom Hunter, which Mary Scanlon mentioned. In the chamber last Friday, he called for a new entrepreneurial enlightenment, particularly dedicated to the young. To achieve that and to think outside the box is the better preserve of the young.</p><p>In a time of serious skills shortages in some of our key developing industries, such as renewables, it is time to educate the teachers, the lecturers, the parents and even some Labour members by having our growing businesses invite them in to see and share the excitement, the potential and the future economic capacity of our country. Let them then encourage their children and their students to embrace that and do the same.</p><p>Above all, let us further engage the young in entrepreneurship through the development of our social enterprises and collectives and create a hunger in them to develop new skills and new wealth, serving and saving their communities as they do so. Even in these difficult financial times there is an opportunity for us all to come together without fear, favour or tribalism to boost the future of our young, rather than have conflict that demoralises them.

I am sure that that challenge is being addressed by Scottish Development International.</p><p>We must also consider impacts on the euro zone from outwith the zone. I refer to impacts such as those that a major creditor nation such as China will have on the euro. China has considerable sovereign debts worth billions of yuan, on which it has already incurred significant losses. It has no direct or meaningful exposure to overseas banks. It is now focusing on domestic investment and consumption, as is outlined in its declining current account balance. Therefore, there will be no long-term financial support for Europe from China. However, I believe that the restrictions on exports from Europe to China and, possibly, India present a continued opportunity for Scotland.</p><p>The dependence of Europe&#8217;s economy on a programme of austerity by the German Government, which is mirrored by the London Government, is wrong. Germany produces more than a quarter of euro zone output. Although it has avoided public and private sector debt excesses, inflation there is rising. Germany cannot be the euro&#8217;s safety net, as its policy enforcement of austerity and cuts is wholly misguided.</p><p>The UK Government should be in the game and playing a key role in international recovery but, instead of being a participant, it is a supine spectator, largely, I suspect, because of its prejudices. The playing fields of Eton might have produced experts in ribald nights of cake throwing and champagne quaffing, but they did not produce economic historians.</p><p>Had Eton done so, perhaps Messrs Cameron and Osborne would have looked closely at the McKinsey &amp; Company reports on the experience of Sweden and Finland after their banks went bust in the early 1990s. As someone who was running eight companies across Europe at the time, I can tell the chamber that the situation was serious. Finland entered its depression with a 13 per cent decline in its gross domestic product and Sweden with a 7 per cent decline; of course, the UK&#8217;s GDP declined by 4 to 5 per cent. However, Sweden bounced back rapidly, growing its GDP by three quarters in four years, while Finland suffered much worse, with no growth for six or seven years. Why the difference? Sweden did not begin to cut its budget until its economy had recovered on the back of a stimulative capital investment programme; on the other hand, Finland&#8217;s early bout of severe austerity compounded and worsened its recession. Moreover, Sweden nationalised its capital banks immediately&#8212;not seven years later&#8212;and then sold its retail banks to other banks.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667921", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Economy (Euro Zone Situation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the current environment, I do not think that the introduction of Scottish bonds would necessarily affect the situation that I described; it might do so when there is more stability.

It is right that the Welfare Reform (Further Provision) (Scotland) Bill is a buttress to the pernicious, iniquitous provisions of the rather hurried UK Welfare Reform Act 2012.</p><p>A key finding of the Institute for Fiscal Studies is that universal credit will strengthen the incentives to work for those who currently have the weakest incentives to work. That might be acceptable if the London Government&#8217;s economic strategy, to which we are unfortunately tied, were to stimulate rather than depress employment. It might be acceptable if that Government had had the foresight to recognise the wider implications&#8212;such as the immediate increased demand on and costs for services such as health and social care&#8212;of its rather precipitous, unthinking legislation in the name of economic management. However, we have yet another unfortunate example of the Tory-Lib Dem coalition mantra, &#8220;Let them eat cake.&#8221;</p><p>Yesterday, I went to Remploy in Edinburgh with my colleague Gordon MacDonald. We went through some of the issues to see what could be done under the auspices of the Government to save the jobs of those on disability living allowance who also earn incomes. It was sad and concerning to see what might happen if that place closed. I believe that it will not, but it is sad to consider what might happen if the employees were put on the unemployment scrapheap. That will not happen on our watch.</p><p>That is why I hope that we show cross-party support to secure the consequences of the bill, which will mitigate the impact of London&#8217;s Welfare Reform Act 2012. Whatever that impact is in total&#8212;we do not yet know what the total impact will be; apparently, we will not know the full details of the proposed reforms until the middle of June&#8212;we have the nonsense of the London Government reducing our budget allocation by &#163;2.5 billion on the basis of an as yet unspelled out programme of reforms. If any policy area highlights the difference between London&#8217;s economic management and the Scottish Government&#8217;s economic competence, that is it.

The time is right to change the balance in this world. In the past, too much time has been taken up by processes, institutions, organisations and funding in a race to the top.

Secondly, they demand investment in our future through intervention and through preventative spend on our childcare and our young. Thirdly, there is an overarching need to close the gap in incomes.

The societies of Sweden, Norway and Japan, where top earners&#8217; income is four times that of the lowest earners, are far more equal than the UK, where the difference is more than sevenfold. The pernicious effects of inequality on societies are clear: eroded trust, increased anxiety and illness, and excessive consumption. The runaway train of executive salaries and institutional financial bonus debauchery has to be stopped by the buffers of outcome attainment, payment for performance and contributions to society. If we want fiscal sustainability we can and should apply the 80:20 rule to all major incomes and items of expenditure in the public and private sectors.</p><p>I have described challenges, which are being met, but I fundamentally believe that the basic financial answers lie in our communities&#8212;in social and community enterprise and in the voluntary and third sectors.

It is a condition, not a disease, and there is no stigma to be offered to or received by people who are in such circumstances. I agree with Mark McDonald in that regard. Lawrie proved that developing and disseminating knowledge and understanding of his condition could become a spur to his business, social and emotional life. If occasionally his condition was mistaken for drunkenness, that did not inhibit him in the occasional libation&#8212;or two, or three.

Section 6(1) of the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 states:</p><p>&#8220;The amount of the Sovereign Grant for a financial year ... is to be determined by the Royal Trustees as follows ... Calculate 15% of the income account net surplus of the Crown Estate&#8221;.</p><p>I rest my case.</p><p>I, too, welcome the debate and congratulate David Stewart on securing it. There is an interesting Northern Ireland Assembly report dated 18 October on the same subject that is worth reading.</p><p>Where to begin? My long-held thesis is the Lloyd Georgian one that leans towards the view that land and its surrounding waters belong to the people. That thesis recognises that, for the time being, the assets that the Crown Estate manages are the property of the monarch in right of the Crown. Pro tem, we subscribe to that. To all intents and purposes, I believe that the Crown Estate Commissioners manage the assets reasonably well in those circumstances, but they do not own the assets. The assets that that public body manages range from offshore renewables, aquaculture, foreshore activities, mussels and oysters, salmon fishing, Princes Street gardens, the King&#8217;s park in Stirling, urban properties, joint ventures and, of course, the inalienable right to all gold and silver that is found on our land.</p><p>As a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, which is discussing the Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill, I find it surprising that the Crown Estate has not registered all the land assets to which it lays claim or from which revenues flow to it. In Scotland, those assets amounted to &#163;207.2 million in 2010-11 and generated a net surplus of &#163;13 million, with a large and increasing share of offshore and onshore renewables. Those investments have gone from &#163;2.2 million in 2008 to &#163;24 million last year. The asset portfolio in Scotland is vastly different from that in England. The Crown Estate has admitted to releasing capital from assets in central London to support renewable energy development in Scotland. That is an advantage that we discussed earlier today and which the Calman commission acknowledged. It considered the different nature of the estates north and south of the border and suggested that a separate and necessarily smaller Scottish organisation would lose out on the significant benefits for investment. Yet, the Crown Estate is doing just that.</p><p>Running the Crown estate in a way that is more appropriate for its different nature in Scotland would result in more efficient management.

As the chairman, Lord Philip, said in his foreword to the 2008 report,</p><p>&#8220;Tribunals are now a vital part of Scotland&#8217;s justice system&#8221;.</p><p>When Sir Andrew Leggatt produced his report, &#8220;Tribunals for Users: One System, One Service&#8221;, in 2001, which had a much more significant impact on England and Wales, it did not&#8212;and perhaps could not&#8212;address all the complications of subsidiary justice in our devolved country, because of the complications involving tribunals that dealt with reserved matters, those that dealt with devolved subjects pre-1999 and those that dealt with devolved matters post-1999. Having sat on the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee as it has wrestled with the Land Registration (Scotland) Bill, I know that the issue of land tribunals has come quite significantly into play.</p><p>Although the Leggatt report was sound, it did not address Scotland&#8217;s needs. The Philip report quite rightly indicated that the system was fragmented, complex, insufficiently independent and lacking quality and it pointed out that tribunals seemed to have passed some inconsistent or erroneous judgments.</p><p>It is clear that we are talking about something that is an integral part of our judicial system&#8212;a devolved and independent system that presides over&#8212;as the minister indicated and which Christine Grahame honestly learned&#8212;80,000 cases and involves more than 40 tribunals in Scotland. It is not objective or independent and is possibly&#8212;perhaps inevitably&#8212;unfair.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, since the Scottish Tribunals Service was launched in 2010, it has supported six tribunals. Of course, we have much more to do to square that particular circle. In a modern just Scotland, there has to be a system that secures best practice and avoids duplication&#8212;a system that is cost effective, secure, consistent, cohesive, which allows ease of communication and which makes justice work quickly, in the interests of coming to an agreement and avoiding people having to have recourse to expensive court action. It is better to have a quicker and less costly way to solve disputes. An efficient and all-embracing tribunals service is the way to do that.</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s consultation and look forward to the report that will be produced once the consultation closes on 15 June. The measures are overdue, which is why I suggest that the debate and the consultation sequitors will redefine the boundaries of fairness and justice in Scotland.</p><p>Although we must retain the benefits and specialisms in law, I suggest that there must be an increasing and transparent role for more legal arbitration on disputes. We require to develop new rules. I welcome the possibility&#8212;indeed, the probability&#8212;of a new process of dispute jurisdiction at a point not too far in the future. I know that that is a matter that will not be kicked into the long grass by the minister.</p><p>I understand that some tribunals are funded by sponsoring departments in the UK Government and elsewhere. That is not independent. I also understand that members of reserved tribunals are appointed by a judicial appointments procedure and others go through a public appointments system. That is not independent either. We need to ensure that all tribunal members are appointed appropriately and are suitably trained to ensure and, indeed, to secure objectivity and impartiality in their decision making. I welcome also the Government&#8217;s intention to seek independent advice to ensure that tribunal members are appropriately remunerated.</p><p>The objective is that there will be no duplication of training, administration or information technology systems across devolved tribunals. Simples.</p><p>As the paper suggests, we need a two-tier tribunals service that will deal with all matters&#8212;reserved and devolved&#8212;to handle dispute resolution, with a subject-based first tier that makes all decisions and is buttressed by an upper tier to which appeals could be referred. I hope that that upper tier would be used infrequently.</p><p>A smart and just Scotland needs to fit in place this piece of our national jigsaw in order to deliver openness, efficiency, responsiveness, consistency and fairness&#8212;our sense of fairness.</p><p>There will, of course, be Jeremiahs who will question, for example, the nearly &#163;12&#160;million to be spent on tribunals in the coming year, but that is another instance of sound preventative spend. If we achieve what we set out to achieve, I ask them this: What price fair, effective and speedy dispute resolution?</p><p>I support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664830", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunal System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In its way, the debate&#8212;enjoined as it is to the Government&#8217;s consultation paper on a new tribunal system for Scotland, as announced by the minister on March 23&#8212;will, I opine, help to redefine significant elements and redraw the geography of common and fair justice in Scotland.

The debate is also part of a process that allows us to challenge structures and focus, and eschew any perception of complacency about this valuable industry. People should make no mistake: we are very serious about the tourism sector.</p><p>By any standards, Scottish tourism is a huge business, making a total contribution of &#163;11.1&#160;billion and employing 270,000 people. In 2006, the Scottish Government launched its tourism framework for change, which outlined the ambition to grow Scotland&#8217;s tourism by 50 per cent by 2015. That ambition was predicated on the World Tourism Organization&#8217;s expectation of global tourism growth of 4 per cent to 5 per cent per year.</p><p>Since then, we have seen a major economic downturn that could have set aspiration against realism. I say to Ms Scanlon that those are not contradictory. Personally, I would settle for aspiration and set about meeting the challenge. Like the minister, I am an optimist. The portents are good and the opportunities are there; the numbers that have been mentioned in today&#8217;s debate show that. The numbers are up.</p><p>The most important aspect of the debate is not the statistics, to which I will return in a minute, but the change of attitude and the can-do leadership of VisitScotland and in other pockets of the tourism industry. That attitude was exemplified by Scott Taylor of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, who said in evidence to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee:</p><p>&#8220;A 50 per cent increase is still our ambition. We should not shy away from that target&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 23 November 2011; c 575.]</p><p>Scott Taylor indicated that there was a challenge in understanding the volume and value of tourism in Scotland. However, I believe that VisitScotland will embark on not just a study but the practical establishment of a widely accessible quality-based data collection and centralised database system, which will detect trends and movements and so validate the security of that targeted growth.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662888", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today&#8217;s debate is important and I welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement of the conference fund; I am sure that it will add to everyone&#8217;s support for the tourism industry.

Our ambitions and aspirations should and will be much higher. I applaud the relationships that some in the industry have already developed with their local colleges and universities. I particularly welcome the proposal that is being discussed in East Lothian to develop an effective serial programme and curriculum on hospitality and tourism. The programme will take 15 and 16-year-olds through school, college and university to become hospitality and tourism experts. The ultimate desire and objective is for the industry to thrive on the back of a trained and relevantly skilled workforce that deploys high-quality customer service.</p><p>We must develop partnerships at local and Scotland level. In the past two weeks, I have attended meetings and conferences with ABBA&#8212;not the Swedish group, but the Ayrshire Bed and Breakfast Association&#8212;and the Ayrshire business forum, and in Dumfries and Galloway. Those areas have, in their own ways, developed organisations that focus on local expertise and products. However, I suggest that, under the umbrella of VisitScotland, they must start to talk to one another. Whether that means Dumfries and Galloway talking with Ayrshire or South Lanarkshire, the bodies must start talking to one another under the marketing umbrella and strategy of VisitScotland.</p><p>I believe that our tourism industry is on the up and that it is in good hands. However, continued development can be guaranteed only on the back of superior quality and connectivity of the transport infrastructure. We have had welcome announcements on the A9 upgrade and the pursuit of a high-speed rail link with the south-east of England. However, on air and airports, to support VisitScotland&#8217;s strategy and our tourism hopes, the devolution of air passenger duty, as has happened in Northern Ireland, is essential, as are direct flights and more appropriately located visa centres and processes.</p><p>VisitScotland should approach the winning years with relish, as should we all.

The problem of our young unemployed people is a challenge. We must pick up the gauntlet, and we are doing so.</p><p>The worst thing that could happen would be for members to succumb to the Jeremiah syndrome. I welcome the tone and content of John Park&#8217;s speech. People who carp and moan and who act through bad word rather than good deed can drive a wedge between old and young, between rich and poor and between the young employed and the young unemployed.</p><p>A report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, &#8220;Young people&#8217;s changing routes to independence&#8221;&#8212;I do not mean constitutional independence&#8212;analysed and compared the outcomes for children who were born in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The foundation described a widening gap between young people in the fast and slow lanes to adulthood. In the slow lane, children of the higher socioeconomic classes spend a lot of time in education and career training and delay marriage and children until they have succeeded as adults. In the fast lane, however, a truncated education leads young adults to experience a disjointed pattern of employment, unemployment, low-paid work and training schemes, rather than an upward career trajectory. In Scotland we must make it our task to eschew such patterns and to start to destroy the economic and employment gap&#8212;the Rowntree gap.</p><p>Our effort must be co-ordinated, cohesive and national. That is why the draft youth employment strategy provides a solid foundation for discussion. We must not just embrace Government initiatives, but take part in programmes such as opportunities for all, thereby validating the profile of the 25,000 apprenticeships per year that will be delivered as part of post-16 education reform. We must work together to hone the draft strategy.</p><p>We must extend the message into communities, through the activities of social enterprises and organisations such as YouthLink Scotland and Voluntary Action Scotland, as well as the Scout Association, the Boys Brigade and the Girls Brigade&#8212;organisations that have a total complement of 110,000 young people in Scotland. We must develop the entrepreneurial equivalent of the Raploch experiment, by taking the concept of creating social and voluntary enterprises in the third sector and taking them to young people in their communities. Some young people will not come looking for such initiatives; it is down to us to find them.</p><p>Youth unemployment stands at 25.5 per cent&#8212;although 35 per cent of the number are in full-time education. We all want the figures to be much better. I will not rehearse everything that has been said about the benefits of being able to generate our own revenue, plan our own expenditure and manage our own economy, but those are certainly factors.</p><p>We all know the consequences of not engaging with the young. It is incumbent on us to ensure that young people not only add value to society but are seen to do so. It is incumbent on us to recognise, appreciate and show the value that they add. That is why we must create and support the youth network that I talked about and marry the network to the youth strategy. It is also why it is critical that we allow the young to have a say in their future, so I wholeheartedly endorse calls to reduce the voting age to 16.</p><p>In developing and securing that interest, we must align young people&#8217;s employment aspirations with the country&#8217;s economic strategy. In the process, we must slay the dragon that says that if someone does not go to university they are somehow a failure. In East Lothian, in an excellent example of the approach that is needed, East Lothian Council&#8217;s education officers and colleges and universities are working, in the context of the tourism sector, to create a vertical strategy, which covers people from the age of 16 right through university.

There is the story that, when I was 18, I thought my father was an idiot and, by the time I was 21, I was surprised by how much he had learned. Perhaps Mr Findlay might want to consider that.</p><p>Presiding Officer,</p><p>&#8220;When in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to&#8221;</p><p>independence, and</p><p>&#8220;That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.&#8221;</p><p>Those are the first words of the declaration of independence of the first 13 United States of America on their secession from England. Ms Ferguson wonders what will happen after independence, so I point out that independence has not turned out too badly for the United States of America or the 50 countries that have seceded from England in the past 30 years.</p><p>The declaration of independence goes on to confirm the sovereignty of the people and their right to alter or abolish any form of government that becomes destructive of that sovereignty. So it is that today&#8217;s motion is a clear recognition of Parliament&#8217;s acceptance and acknowledgement that it is the sovereign right of only the Scottish people to agree the form and type, and to determine the conditions of government that are best suited to its need. Those conditions will be affirmed by the people and the people will choose.</p><p>That was enshrined as intended, but restricted, in the 1989 claim of right. It was committed and summarised by Canon Kenyon Wright at the Constitutional Convention in 1989, when he said:</p><p>&#8220;What if that other voice we all know so well responds by saying, &#8216;We say no, and we are the state&#8217;,? Well we say yes - and we are the people.&#8221;</p><p>That conditional 1989 claim of right was signed by 58 of Scotland&#8217;s 72 MPs, seven of Scotland&#8217;s members of the European Parliament, 59 out of 65 Scottish councils, and large swathes of civic Scotland. I say to Mr Findlay that, this time, the motion is a pledge that the interests of those in Scotland are paramount, but it is no call for dogmatism, isolationism or any conditionality that restricted the 1989 claim of right. It does not demand an outpouring of wailing that it is anti-this or anti-that.</p><p>The motion demands much more than the restricted 1989 claim of right did. It is a reaffirmation of the fundamental right of the Scottish people and people in Scotland to determine their constitutional needs and future requirements for the Government that they seek. In the 1980s, people such as Johann Lamont, Gordon Brown and Charles Kennedy were right to be proud of signing the claim of right, even if it was restricted. I hope that they will also now sign the new claim of right.</p><p>Let them and us all adopt and accept without condition the sovereign right of the people to determine whatever form of government they want. It is not about what we want. There should be no preconditions and no lines in the sand.

His promotion is well deserved.</p><p>I am delighted to support the Government&#8217;s motion and am even more delighted to look forward to the fray of the local elections in May this year. As we all know and as has been said, the 2007 elections were a shambles, but the 2011 parliamentary elections ran smoothly. The system for the 2012 local elections should be better and should allow us to focus on our policies. They will, of course, be helped by the decoupling of the national and local elections and by the in-depth electronic counting system aided and abetted by the professionalism of more fully trained presiding and returning officers. The electronic system report is very readable not just for information technology anoraks and is a strong foundation for voter confidence.</p><p>This time, we politicians have no place to hide. The people&#8217;s focus on policies and their decisions will out. They have a right. They rightly demand security of process, fairness of proportionality, proximate accountability and, above all, clarity of policy. It has been said that there is concern about the low turnout levels. It is incumbent on all national and local politicians to address that issue. I believe that part of the solution is that all elections that pertain to and affect solely and directly the sovereignty of the voters of Scotland must be devolved to and controlled by the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Electoral conditions should move with the ever-increasing maturity of our nation. That is why, for example, we must pursue legislation to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the local government elections and, indeed, all Scottish elections.</p><p>The now-accepted Gould report revealed many of the issues relating to the 2007 debacle. There were too many such issues, and there is not enough time to rehearse them. Narrow partisan politics, electronic counting, inadequate preparation and descriptive confusion were all highlighted in the report. I welcome the past considerations and actions, as well as the new initiatives that the minister has announced today.</p><p>We have&#8212;happily&#8212;moved on from 2007, but there is still one concerning element, which I mentioned. That element was highlighted in the joint statement made on 27 October 2009 by Mr Crawford, who is now Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy, and Ann McKechin, who was then under-secretary of state in the Scotland Office. That statement was collaborative and substantive in its response to the Electoral Commission. Specifically, item 8 of the statement said that the electoral management board&#8217;s remit</p><p>&#8220;should extend to all elections in Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>So it should, of course.</p><p>With confidence in the process, let us now progress together to the constructive politics of local administration elections in Scotland. The voting system has demanded the development and encouragement of partnerships in councils, positive debates and meaningful outcomes that will finally destroy the hierarchies and hegemonies of local authorities that besmirched some of Scotland&#8217;s large local authorities in the past.</p><p>Let us go into the fray in May. We on the SNP side of the chamber will point to our major achievements in leading or working in council partnerships, such as the council tax freeze, the small business bonus scheme, the introduction of single outcome agreements, preventative spending and maintaining local government revenue in cash terms. Others will argue their particular case equally strongly.</p><p>Throughout the Borders, and indeed throughout Scotland, the SNP will fight to win each council outright, but it will be constructive at all times if partnership is necessary. In South Ayrshire Council, the SNP worked in partnership with the Tories&#8212;we picked up a council that was almost bankrupt and have now turned it into a fully liquid council. Let us debate and do battle.</p><p>I return briefly to my earlier point about allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections. We must look forward even beyond the election in May. I have no idea what the average age of candidates in the election will be, but it will certainly not be 16 or 17. We must not only encourage and avail the involvement of the young in voting but collectively&#8212;as it is our responsibility&#8212;and actively secure their participation.</p><p>As I and other members have said, turnout at local elections is already too low. I know that the youth vote issue is particularly dear to the minister&#8217;s heart. The active involvement of young people at an early age will, I believe, prevent our elections and local elections from withering on the vine. Our nation and its future democracy are too precious to allow that to happen.

It should and will promote a seismic shift in the direction of preventative spending and a measurable return on investment. It will be a strategy that can leverage capital and infrastructure spend.

As the committee asserted in some of its views, we now need flexibility, continuity, sustainability, consistency and a constructive debate on a range of issues that affect our national financial performance. We owe no less to our people, over whom the global economic sword of Damocles now hangs. Many of them are exposed daily and nightly to the anxieties and worries that those global pressures create.

On capital spend, it is right&#8212;particularly for jobs&#8212;that we focus on risk-based investment. We must examine the management of our asset base through the various funding mechanisms and funds that are available to us. I welcome the committee&#8217;s challenge on economic growth parameters and the role that capital funds such as the national renewables infrastructure fund will have on renewables and port facilities&#8212;and, therefore, exports, which will underpin measurable growth.</p><p>Investment in, and flexible capital expenditure on, assets that will contribute to efficiency and reduced future spend are critical to future economic recovery and jobs, as is the maintenance of those assets. The same is true of the disposal of underused assets that are irreconcilable with our future economic strategy but which still suck in maintenance costs. That could provide a real revenue opportunity for local and national Government. The Finance Committee&#8217;s questions on the impact of capital spend are well drawn.</p><p>As the report says, pay policy is key to the overall budget strategy. The pay policy that the cabinet secretary has inspired and defined plays a particularly key role in employment and security of employment in the current economic circumstances. However, I ask that, when the Finance Committee meets in January to discuss the Hutton report, it pays particular attention to chapter 4, which requires that we address the contractual position and earnings of the high-salary and bonus earners in the public sector. If, once the pay freeze is lifted, we allow the income of those on the higher rungs of the earnings ladder to rise unfairly, we are more likely to create unfulfilled expectations among those on the lower rungs.</p><p>I welcome the declaration in the committee&#8217;s report on the decisive shift to preventative spend in the public sector, to which Mr McDonald referred. As Inverclyde alliance CPP said adroitly in its evidence, local authorities must make a change in culture and attitude. That means no protectionism, but an acceptance of better and wider sharing of good practice across all public sector agencies, and no barriers to the forces of the third sector, the voluntary sector and social enterprises. By harnessing their potential and releasing their energies, we can secure innovation that will play a key role in delivering preventative spend.</p><p>I spoke earlier about fear. It was Franklin Delano Roosevelt who famously said:</p><p>&#8220;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself&#8221;.</p><p>This is no time for our proud nation to be filled with anxiety or fear.

Of course we are not. Are we content? Of course we are not. The youth of our nation are the trustees of our posterity. Although the young may have a tendency to live in the present, they want to work for the future. That is what we want for them, and that is what we are working for. Even though we have one hand tied behind our back, in that we do not yet control the economic levers that would allow this nation to exercise its assets and revenues to the benefit of young people in relation to youth unemployment and entrepreneurship, at least we have a strategy and a programme.</p><p>Iain Gray mentioned that the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds is 21.5 per cent in Scotland, whereas it is 20.2 per cent for the UK as a whole. He should also have highlighted, as the First Minister did, that 27,000, or 32.6 per cent, of those 84,000 in Scotland are in full-time education, whereas in the UK as a whole the figure is 20.6 per cent.</p><p>I said that we are not complacent. The Tories recommend job-creation incentives in the private sector and the capital investment strategy, which is designed to boost economic growth. That is exactly what I thought the cabinet secretary had outlined in the spending review and budget. The small business bonus scheme now takes 85,000 businesses out of rate payment. If we could get them, and other small businesses, to take on one person each, we could create 40,000 jobs, many of them for the young and apprentices.</p><p>We are shifting &#163;750 million from revenue to capital spend over the next three years; that is critical for jobs and youth employment. Given his actions this week, it is instructive to note that the penny has finally dropped for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p><p>The creation of 125,000 apprenticeships over the next five years; the plan to reduce youth unemployment through initiatives such as the opportunities for all programme; the reform of the post-16 education system; and the design to continue to provide financial support for our young people are all part of a strategy. Are we content? No.</p><p>The momentum on inward investment, to which the First Minister referred, adds to that strategy. Allan Lyall, vice-president of Amazon Europe, said recently:</p><p>&#8220;We are looking for great people that look after our customers the way they need to. As long as that continues, we&#8217;ll be in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>The vast majority of our young people are great people.

The actions of today will, no doubt, be remembered by the vast majority of Scots for some time. Despite the Government&#8217;s commitment to affordable, sustainable and fair public sector pensions and despite the Government&#8217;s commitment&#8212;illustrated so often&#8212;to maintaining the social wage and employment for all workers, above all public sector workers, through various mechanisms including freezing the council tax and abolishing prescription charges, today Scotland&#8217;s elderly, its children, its lonely, its sick and their friends, neighbours and relatives are facing disruption to their daily lives. Why? Against the backdrop of the requirement&#8212;which everyone has agreed on today&#8212;to amend public sector pension contributions and provision as a result of people living longer and interest rates fluctuating, we encounter today not irresponsible but understandable and regrettable action.</p><p>We are empathetic. Why? As has been mentioned, the Hutton report was designed to report on the long-term affordability of public sector pensions and called for an increase in members&#8217; contributions while protecting their accrued rights. The report contained a long-term proposal for reforms to contributions. I point out to Gavin Brown and Willie Rennie that the proposal was not a response to the fiscal pressures that the country currently faces: it was a proposal not for the immediate situation, but for the long-term situation. But what has happened? The Tories have used the proposal as a key to unlock the safe that contains the wherewithal to allow them and their supine praetorian guards&#8212;the Lib Dems&#8212;to grab the immediate short-term funds to contribute towards reducing the London Government&#8217;s deficit.</p><p>Many members have already talked about plans that we would have followed had we not faced financial blackmail from Danny Alexander. I do not plan to rehearse those arguments, and I will not, as many others have done, address the effects of the Con-Dem action on public sector pensions and workers. We know the effects; we have seen them outside the building today. Instead, I will address the causes.</p><p>The harsh reality is that the London Government in the present constitutional arrangement is no longer fit for purpose. The dispute over pensions reflects that. There is a rationale behind the deficit-reducing attack on public pensions and on the public sector and its benefits. Wilkinson and Pickett say that the London Government blamed the broken society on the benefit culture and the antisocial behaviour of the poor, and that nearly everyone blames the broken economy on bankers and the rich, but the harsh truth is that the broken society, the broken economy, and what will be the broken union, result from gross inequalities in our society. The attack on the incomes of the poorer, and on the pensions of people in the public sector, is a result of the antediluvian, ancient and false social war between Labour and the Tories in London.</p><p>On the one hand we have the Labour Party&#8212;that organised hypocrisy&#8212;a party that panics in a crisis of its own making. It has been ever thus&#8212;from MacDonald through to Wilson, Callaghan, Blair and Brown. The party has selective amnesia. It forgets that Gordon Brown scrapped tax relief on dividends, and devastated the value of pension funds to the tune of between &#163;5 billion and &#163;7 billion. Hypocrisy. Last year, when in power at Westminster, MPs crossed picket lines&#8212;just as the leader of the London Labour Party did today. Labour has been advised by the GMB to cross picket lines. [Interruption.] I will come to the Tories in a minute, but let the Labour Party in Scotland explain today to the people of Scotland&#8212;their employers&#8212;why they have had the front to turn their backs on them.</p><p>On the other hand&#8212;[Interruption.] There is plenty of time, Mr McLetchie.</p><p>On the other hand, we have the Tories, a Tudor monarchy with mobiles. The sons of Thatcher and the sins of Thatcherism are being revisited on Scotland today. I am tempted to say that there is a coincidence between the Falklands and Libya, but I will pass over that. The heightening of tension, and the extreme language of conflict, are reminiscent of the early 1980s. The Bullingdon club bullies are now out in force. Wisden has said that the Bullingdon club, although ostensibly one of the original University of Oxford cricket teams, used cricket matches as a respectable front for the mischievous, destructive and self-indulgent tendencies of its members.</p><p>To both parties, the message is, &#8220;Get your hypocritical and bullying tanks off the Scottish lawn.&#8221; This Government has shown the ability to consult, to negotiate and to come to sensible solutions.

He said:</p><p>&#8220;the fact is that public service pensions are not &#8216;gold-plated&#8217; ... half of public service pensioners receive less than &#163;6,000 a year.&#8221;</p><p>Moreover, in paragraph 4.27 of his interim report, he says:</p><p>&#8220;Net of ... contributions ... payments peak at about 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2010-11, before falling to below 1.1 per cent&#8221;</p><p>of gross domestic product</p><p>&#8220;by 2059-60.&#8221;</p><p>There is no mention of a blatant short-term cash raid to bring forward and accelerate the timescale for meeting the above objective. Of course, as Mary Scanlon said, we need to discuss and debate pension changes, but we must do so over time. The Hutton report certainly provides a basis for those discussions.</p><p>I believe that a strike will achieve little. However, it is not &#8220;deeply irresponsible&#8221;; it might be understandable and it is certainly regrettable. The people who will suffer will be public service customers and public sector employees themselves. However, the situation is not helped by the kind of crocodile tears and grandstanding that we saw from the Labour Party yesterday; the Labour Party is not and never will be the guardians of public sector employees. Labour members&#8217; political posturing on such matters confirms that they are still in a time warp. In other words, they are 1970s Klingons.</p><p>Churchill said:</p><p>&#8220;To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war.&#8221;</p><p>That is why we call on the unions and the non-union members in Scotland&#8217;s public sector to engage with our&#8212;their&#8212;Government on seeking a meaningful dialogue and way forward on future pension provision.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655002", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No&#8212;I have only four minutes.

Those are skills in services that will be exportable, as Gavin Brown said, and emerging oil exploration in Brazil and China, for example, affords great revenue-earning opportunities for Scots-based oil and gas professionals and companies.

All those are critical but only solvable, counterable or deliverable on the back of sound communications. The message to the regional services and the public is that, should we encounter the worst, the communication is indeed two way&#8212;but of course traffic Scotland, Traveline and the traffic customer care line are key in all that.</p><p>It is unrealistic to expect a reactive hotline to our God. Preparedness is essential to forestall the worst of any potential crisis, so it is not unreasonable to ask car drivers that, should they wish to drive, they check and prepare their vehicles for winter, they update themselves on how to drive in severe winter conditions, they plan journeys in advance and they carry emergency equipment and supplies just in case of breakdown for the time until the services can get to them.</p><p>Better still, let drivers consider public transport and, in the case of longer journeys, travel by bus and rail when they can. I commend the proposed initiatives of ScotRail&#8212;I see Mr Johnstone shaking his head: he obviously does not want to use ScotRail. I commend ScotRail for its plans to invest in new de-icing equipment, upgrading maintenance and rapid service return, and improving station access.</p><p>Overall, it is by working together, and as a community and communities, that we shall overcome possible serious weather.

I regret that we have had the carping that we have had, and I really do not understand Patrick Harvie&#8217;s point about who is directing the political football. Fuel poverty is far too important an issue for the naked party politics that we have heard on the Scottish Government and the constitution. Although I welcome the debate, I stress the importance of that point.</p><p>Fuel poverty is an amalgam of limited incomes, the drive for energy efficiency and fuel costs. We all know the impact that the London-based economic crisis has had on incomes. I would not dare to follow Mike MacKenzie on energy efficiency and housing, which he spoke about so well. What I will do is talk about fuel costs. As a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, I confess my personal anger and distress about the subject, on which we must rise above party politics.</p><p>As Stuart McMillan said, in June the committee had representatives of the six major energy companies before it. At the end of the meeting, I asked them whether they would work with us on a cross-party, panel basis to reduce and help to eradicate fuel poverty in Scotland. To a woman and a man, they said that they would. Despite the actions of Energy Action Scotland, Consumer Focus Scotland and all the other bodies involved, the fuel companies are giving us straws in the wind. They may already be paying lip service to the fuel poverty forum.</p><p>Despite the positive action on funding that has been taken in the present difficult economic situation&#8212;the &#163;65 million that the Government will spend on fuel poverty and energy efficiency this year, the &#163;50 million that will be spent over the lifetime of the Parliament on the warm homes fund&#8212;</p><p>Jenny Marra rose&#8212;</p><p>No, I will not take any interventions.</p><p>In addition, the minister announced further spending of &#163;1.5 million. Despite all that, the energy assistance package and all the other packages, we now face an almost unbelievable challenge. The 900,000 households in poverty in Scotland face an oligopolistic market, in which the remuneration of a senior executive of one energy provider rose by 83 per cent&#8212;against the background of the poor and the elderly suffering the pain of sliding into poverty.</p><p>As with the banks, successive London Governments have failed to tackle the power and the wealth of the few.

Only days&#8212;indeed, hours&#8212;after Danny Alexander gave his rather upbeat speech on the economy, the International Monetary Fund reduced its UK growth forecast by nearly 30 per cent. That upbeat speech should be contrasted with that by Vince Cable only two days later. That shows the mess that the London Government is in. Even with my passing interest in astrology, it is difficult for me to foretell what the London Government&#8217;s economic performance might be even in the near future. We have competence; London has Danny Alexander.</p><p>I believe that, on being appointed as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander was given an economics book, but he has not filled or coloured it in yet. He should have been given a history book instead of that economics book. He would then have read that, in the 1950s, for example, in a period of stagnation and rising unemployment, a Tory Government under Harold Macmillan embarked on a major capital investment programme. Some 125,000 homes were to be built and there were other capital programmes to stimulate a slowing and sluggish economy. The same approach was taken in the United States in the 1930s. Harold Macmillan said at the time:</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never had it so good.&#8221;</p><p>If we had to leave things much longer to Danny Alexander and George Osborne, we would never have had it so bad.</p><p>Nigel Don made the point that making capital investment is right, as is the balance in the rest of the strategy. The approach sits alongside the facilities and opportunities for training and education, particularly for the young unemployed and our apprentices; it runs in parallel with further efficiencies through spend-to-save programmes in the public sector; and it will create incentives to better our environment. The spending review is wedded, bonded and welded to our recent economic performance.</p><p>It is absolutely right to maintain the social wage and consumption, but prioritise investment. The asset management strategy to dispose of underutilised assets and shift to the optimum utilisation of good and needed assets to boost the economy is absolutely right. The London Government&#8217;s slash-and-burn economic thinking and the cutting of our capital budget by 36 per cent over the next four years&#8212;again, Nigel Don referred to that&#8212;represent the economics of the madhouse. Osborne and Alexander are doing for the UK economy what the Boston strangler did for the door-to-door salesman. Investing capital in the major projects that the cabinet secretary has announced while securing public service delivery is no mean feat in the current financial imposition.</p><p>The point has been made that the investment of capital in housing and energy to combat fuel poverty, avoid health degradation and, in the process, reduce costs to business is welcome. Welcome, too, is the investment of capital in the improvement of our infrastructure, which will enable us to capitalise on economic growth, and in our export industries such as food and drink. All that contributes to the generation of increased national income in the future.</p><p>Last week, I said that the economic position&#8212;even the international economic position&#8212;presents us with a real challenge. However, it also provides us with real opportunities to create a more level playing field in the future in terms of income; to invest in efficiency; to invest in our young, so that they can meet their aspirations; to restructure and create a public service environment that is fit for the 21st century; and to invest in measures to ensure fairness for our people and communities.</p><p>This aspirational spending review is for the benefit of the people and by working together with the people of Scotland we will make our nation leaner, fitter, fairer and more ready to settle our own destiny.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651370", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Spending Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am glad to agree with Patrick Harvie that the spending review smacks of competence.

It is a replica of a Dido class cruiser of 5,770 tonnes that was wonderfully built by Scotts of Greenock and launched on 10 September 1943. The model was hewn out of a large block of wood and expresses every detail of the ship. It was carved by a sailor on that ship, the HMS Royalist, which was attached to the home fleet at Scapa Flow. That sailor was my father and it would be my privilege to give the model to the museum when it is open.</p><p>The ship left Scapa Flow with the home fleet for a carrier-borne air strike against the infamous German battleship the Tirpitz in the K&#229;fjord in November 1943. I am not sure whether this is a coincidence but, on the day that I was born, the ship was involved in operation Potluck against enemy shipping as it went past the coast of Norway on its way to Archangel and Murmansk.</p><p>There were 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945 involving 1,400 merchant ships delivering vital supplies to the Soviet Union under the lend-lease programme. Some 85 merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships were lost. The Kreigsmarine lost four ships and 30 U-boats.

Despite all that, Leningrad under siege received food and munitions supplies so that the Russians could then be in a position to turn the German offensive.

Change is constant.&#8221;</p><p>We now have an opportunity to continue to embrace, secure and reinforce our social contract with the people of Scotland. That will inevitably mean a change in structures as we know them. We will continue the reform and better use of our public services and provide a more targeted focus to our revenue spending yet still protect our elderly, develop and train our young, succour the sick, fast-track our small businesses and social enterprises and create the energy-driven and environmentally friendly society that we all seek. Opportunity, change and efficiency will all be achieved in the development of our capital base and the optimum use of our existing and proposed working assets.</p><p>Despite Mr Johnstone&#8217;s protestations, that is why it has been right to invest in a new housing programme, which will create 15,000 jobs across the country. That is why it is right to introduce legislation to ensure that our housing stock is used more effectively and is fully employed. That is why it is right to consult rigorously on the proposal to enable councils to apply an additional council tax levy on long-term empty properties, as Dennis Robertson said. That is why it is right to strengthen the system of land registration in Scotland to support the objective of underpinning the economy and the economic determination of our most significant asset. I hope that that will also lead to more openness from the large retail and commercial companies that bank land. If the land does not yet belong to the people, at least we will know to whom it does belong.</p><p>As I have mentioned the need for structural change and targeted revenue spend, it would be remiss of me to finish without briefly addressing the need to restructure our home security services&#8212;the police service and the fire brigade, but particularly the former. Only the unwitting would suggest that the current police structure and its governance, which was conceived 40 or so years ago, is now fit for purpose. The current distribution of police personnel, in which there are 8,417 officers in Strathclyde, 875 in central Scotland and only 508 in Dumfries and Galloway, is redolent of a bygone age. We have eight police boards, which are largely unaccountable and probably undemocratic, with eight chief constables, eight administration departments, eight human resources departments and eight payroll departments, plus many other departments. That does not reflect the spending need in this age of technology, nor does it provide the efficiency that is required for today&#8217;s crime management.</p><p>We need a single police force that is consistent in its national practice, but which is commanded locally and is democratically accountable, and in which front-line services are protected. I point out to the Lib Dems that nobody in their right mind would prejudice the recent remarkable reduction in crime statistics. We want a force that has greater backroom efficiency and optimum flexibility for officer disposition. We can mobilise 250 officers to assist in sorting out England&#8217;s riots, so there is no reason why we cannot build into the structure the efficiency or flexibility to allow local officers to be moved around Scotland to support major events and to deal with particular crime issues&#8212;that can be done now.</p><p>I have talked about opportunity, change and efficiency.

I emphasised the need to develop our key international ports to open the doors to and from Scotland that will secure the aforementioned goals. Since I made that speech, I have had several conversations, not least with leaders in the renewables industry. It is a key tenet and strong personal belief of mine that the renewables revolution provides us with the opportunity not just to be at the cutting edge of that industry, but to underpin the historic and current worldwide recognition of our manufacturing and engineering skills. If those are disposed properly, we can be a world leader in support, products and services to the renewables industry worldwide&#8212;the modern-day equivalent of the industrial revolution. However, those conversations revealed an inadequacy in our port facilities to support that vision. Bluntly put, as it was to me, we have to upgrade our sea and airport facilities, not just for renewables but for export and tourism. Otherwise, we shall struggle to compete globally.</p><p>The previous SNP Government reacted positively by investing in support to some of our ports, and that was welcome. To use a housing analogy, we have laid the foundations. However, to create the windows and doors on the world, which is the vision for the port authorities, with support from our Government, we should embrace the future opportunities that the enhanced and developed port facilities will bring to shareholders, employees and communities alike.

It is an important motion and, although I might not question its intent, I question some of its content. For example, I do not believe that there is a new focus by the Government on care for the elderly. There has always been a focus on care for the elderly. That focus is not new; it is being refreshed, and that refreshment is healthy.</p><p>Although we must never diminish the seriousness of situations such as those involving the Elsie Inglis care home, Southern Cross and Ninewells, we must be very careful that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. I will give two examples of why that is the case. First, for the past eight years, following the massive stroke that my partner Mary&#8217;s mum had, I have had the privilege&#8212;it has been a privilege&#8212;of pushing her in a wheelchair up and down Ayr High Street nearly every Saturday afternoon. I risk an intervention when I say that she knows the price of clothes at Marks and Spencer. She is declining mentally, but she is healthy, generally happy, feisty, at times very independent mentally, and clean and tidy, and her wellbeing is a tribute to the carers in the council-run South Lodge residential home in Ayr and its partnership with the local health service and health providers.</p><p>Secondly, last Friday, we were invited to a dance at the Royal Air Forces Association Club in Prestwick, where we met a lady&#8212;she was a lady&#8212;who was 92 years old and who, as a singer, had entertained the troops in the second world war. She was vibrant and bright, and she danced most of the night away. Although I accept that that might not be a usual circumstance, it highlights the need for us to&#8212;indeed, it demands that we&#8212;keep refreshing our thoughts on the elderly and the care that they require. In my book, looking after them is not all about organisation, reorganisation, process or cost, although it is partly about that; it is about creating and attaining or achieving a cultural shift and a change in attitude to the elderly&#8212;and not just in the Parliament&#8212;and extending their independence for as long as and as effectively as we can.</p><p>When care is needed, the client&#8212;not recurring reorganisation&#8212;must be the core, the purpose and the reason for good health and care service delivery. The creation of some form of integrated national or community-based organisation that is centralised, bureaucratic and remote has little bearing on establishing a client-based service and determining where that service is needed and should be delivered.</p><p>The national challenge of demographic change is that we continue to eschew calls for full integration and organisation of services, and that we continue to refresh and develop further efficient local commissioning partnerships that involve equal input and responsibility on the part of councils, health boards and health and care providers&#8212;partnerships that are built on trust and strong leadership. There is a clear distinction between integrating services and budgets and integrating organisations, as some have suggested. It is clear that, in such partnerships, it is critical that whichever organisation is determined to be the lead organisation&#8212;whether the health board, the council or whatever&#8212;that is the organisation that leads and which is solely responsible for the delivery of the service that is needed. It must be local, accountable and measurable.</p><p>We face a huge ageing and demographic explosion over the next 20 years, and I am afraid to say that I am a lot closer to that explosion than most. I have mentioned the need for a national attitudinal and cultural change in promoting health improvement and independence of mind and body of the elderly, but that process must be an evolution. There must not be a rush to change or to provide a catch-all solution that may not be needed urgently or, indeed, everywhere. We need change that provides meaningful local health and care partnerships to deliver the services, at the centre of which is the elderly client. That is why I applaud the Government&#8217;s &#163;70&#160;million change fund, which will help to effect that change.</p><p>Given that we are dealing with the sensitive community of the elderly and their carers and health support, change must not be dramatic. As a consequence, the integrity and capability of private sector social care providers&#8212;as they, too, embrace change&#8212;must be subject to the most detailed financial scrutiny and management. There must be on-going, targeted, random&#8212;as mentioned by Jackie Baillie&#8212;regular, focused and rigorous inspection of social care providers, especially those in the private sector.</p><p>We must think of the elderly not just as the elderly but as our mums and dads, our grannies and granddads. We are here because they were there.

That focus is not new; it is being refreshed, and that...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Chic", "last_name": "Brodie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80528", "house": "4", "member_id": "80528", "person_id": "25077", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "South Scotland"}, "section_id": "22648190", "hpos": "44", "gid": "2011-06-09.0.43", "epobject_id": "22648233", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2011-06-09.0.0&amp;s=speaker%3A25077+section%3Asp#g0.43", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80528"}, {"body": "<p>It is a pleasure to follow such a maiden speech.</p><p>I begin by paying a fulsome and public tribute to the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth for his husbandry of the nation&#8217;s finances over the past four years. A great measure of the success of any organisation, company or association is how well the books are looked after. The nation&#8217;s books have been very well looked after.</p><p>Acronyms are a problem. I fought a constituency seat so, when I received a document on my first day here that said, &#8220;Chic Brodie&#8212;SOS&#8221;, my first thought was that somebody needed help. My second thought was that it was Scotland on Sunday and that I needed help. Eventually, I became reconciled with South of Scotland, only after one of the less charitable of my colleagues said that it actually meant silly so-and-so. I will explain why I use acronyms in a minute.</p><p>The Government deserves great credit for its proposed investment in two specific areas that are targeted at developing national sustainable growth: social enterprise and technology transfer. I am proud to be part of a Government that has committed to spend &#163;125 million on the third sector and the creation of more social enterprises, alongside our plans for 25,000 modern apprenticeships and, as the cabinet secretary said, the youth employment Scotland initiative. I know that the cabinet secretary and the minister are heavily committed to those sectors as a major investment platform as our nation goes forward. From such little acorns, great oak trees can grow.</p><p>There is a plethora of organisations, whether it be&#8212;here I go&#8212;the SCVO, the SSEC, the CEMVO, CEIS, SKS or any of the others. I could go on and on, acronym after acronym, good company after good company. Those companies now have the opportunity to respond to the Government&#8217;s investment initiative to grow with a rationalisation of intent, to voluntarily create a more cohesive, focused and joined-up sector and to provide clarity on what they do.</p><p>There are 41,000 very good reasons for doing that: the claimants aged 16 to 24. Although we have made and are making great strides into eating into that number, the diverse social enterprise organisations can further aid and abet Scotland&#8217;s future growth with a common vision and purpose, in particular to enthuse and employ our young unemployed.</p><p>The Government is facilitating that work, but the likes of the co-operative mutuals, with 400 shops in Scotland, 27,000 people, a turnover of &#163;4.6 billion a year and assets in excess of &#163;22 billion, the credit unions with assets of &#163;185 million, the 200 housing associations, the social firms, the development trusts and the CICs&#8212;there I go again; the community interest companies&#8212;can all grasp the Government&#8217;s intent to see them as a vehicle for real, sustainable growth and, beyond that, social cohesion. They can do that by coming together, working together and involving the young, particularly in deprived areas, in meaningful job pursuits and innovation, and by securing profits that can then be channelled back to refuel our communities. By locking in their assets, the enterprises can and will be one of the engines for sustainable growth.</p><p>Social enterprises must not become another vehicle for the private sector to get grants by the back door. Our goal is clear. As part of the pyramid of economic growth, one of the cornerstones has to be a socially beneficial enterprise mechanism that benefits communities. Let it be part of what we can call the small and beautiful society, which will allow us to progress community enterprises, where practical and possible, through SME status to become, in some cases, larger employing companies.</p><p>Equally, we have the ITIs&#8212;yet another acronym&#8212;or their successors. They should piggyback again on the Government&#8217;s multimillion-pound investment in facilitation to develop a positive and assertive go-to-market philosophy that is real and sustainable. If the likes of South Africa and Canada can establish successful technology transfer laboratories, Scotland can show that we are better.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s Government&#8217;s vision on future sustainable growth is clear. We seek a coming together of social enterprise organisations, university research and development departments and technology transfer channels to share that vision and to embrace it and its benefits for our nation and in particular for its young.</p><p>I will end my contribution with a message to the chamber: TTFN.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647823", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to follow such a maiden speech.

On a personal basis, I congratulate you on your election to your elevated position. Having done battle with you in another place, I assume and hope that there will be no need for further battles in this place.</p><p>It is a privilege to be here as a member for South Scotland. In making my maiden speech, I hesitate as I remember the words of that well-known Scots bard William Shakespeare, who wrote:</p><p>&#8220;For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,</p><p>Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,</p><p>To stir men&#8217;s blood; I only speak right on;</p><p>I tell you that which you yourselves do know.&#8221;</p><p>My hesitation and trepidation are due to the fact that those words were ascribed by Shakespeare to Julius Caesar, and we know what happened to him after he made that speech. With that consequence in mind, I took the liberty of e-mailing a copy of the quote to the leader of the Lib Dems at lunch time. However, with my innate and inborn sense of humility, I tell you that which you yourselves do know.</p><p>A thread that ran through the election campaign like a commentary and which was confirmed in several speeches today was the theme of jobs and job creation. Leaving the sometime cosmetic of election tribalism aside, I believe that that issue should and, I hope, will bind us together. Having said that, I believe that we should recognise the worth in the fact that unemployment is falling faster in Scotland than in the rest of the UK and that growth has increased in all broad sectors of our economy in production and services.</p><p>Through the competence of the Government, we have demonstrated the confidence and capability to meet the challenges of creating more job opportunities in the future&#8212;none more so than the opportunities, which the First Minister alluded to this morning, that are provided by encouraging the development of exports and the generation of inward investment and foreign income.</p><p>Internationally, Scotland now walks much taller than it did pre-devolution. As the First Minister highlighted yesterday, events such as the homecoming, the Commonwealth games, the Ryder cup and the world gymnastics championships have all incremented the profile of Scotland abroad, as did our earlier involvement in Malawi and southern Africa under a previous Labour-Lib Dem Administration.</p><p>In commerce and industry, established industrial giants such as Clyde Blowers, Aggreko and many others continue to add to our international business profile, as no doubt will new incomers such as Amazon, Mitsubishi and Doosan. For long-term job sustainability and growth, however, we must and will transfer that culture of the importance of exporting and foreign income generation to our small and medium-sized businesses. That culture embraces innovation, quality, and customer service and care.</p><p>Our Government&#8217;s proposed export support initiative&#8212;a &#163;2.5 million comprehensive programme to prompt and support around 100 SMEs to develop the capability to export to and exploit growth opportunities in new markets and to create significant jobs&#8212;should be welcomed unanimously and whole-heartedly. It is also to be hoped that the private sector&#8212;some of those SMEs&#8212;will use the benefits of the proposed modern apprenticeship programme to develop international sales and marketing skills, language skills and local custom awareness.</p><p>Whether it be in renewables and the manufacturing base to support that sector, the food and drink sector, the life sciences sector, tourism, financial services or the knowledge industries, we have a unique and focused export opportunity. Sweden is successful by largely being focused on mobile phones and the telecom industry, Switzerland is successful by being focused on timepieces and chocolates, and Italy is successful by being focused on tourism, fashion, furniture and food and drink. We have a huge raft of opportunities in the sectors that I have just mentioned&#8212;opportunities that can be set in a true perspective. We in Ayrshire and South Scotland are ready to play our part.</p><p>Also, transport infrastructure and digital highways have been developed, are developing and will be developed to support an international push.</p><p>We must encourage our exporters, our airport owners and port authorities to use the likes of Prestwick airport&#8212;which I hope will soon be renamed Robert Burns international airport&#8212;for export freight consolidation and forwarding, and we must have our deep-sea east coast ports linked with Rotterdam, which has a fast rail link to the middle of Germany that could take our products to the heart of Europe. It is a financial, logistical and climatical nonsense to consolidate Scottish exports and then take them by road for distribution from Heathrow and the ports on the south-east coast of England.</p><p>Henceforth, for our small and medium-sized businesses, let exporting and foreign income generation be bywords for long-term jobs and economic success. Let Scotland&#8217;s businesses once again flourish in the international fields and let Scotland&#8217;s jobs boom and bloom. As we face the world, we can then say that we achieved that together.</p>", "hdate": "2011-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647713", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.
