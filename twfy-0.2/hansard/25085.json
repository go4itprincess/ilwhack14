The Scottish Government has taken a lead and shown its determination to breathe new life into our town centres, which can be seen in the fact that in 2012 the Scottish Government commissioned the national review of town centres. The review was conducted by Malcolm Fraser, the leading architect, together with a panel of experts and the group&#8217;s recommendations were published in July last year. The Scottish Government&#8217;s town centre action plan was published in response to those recommendations and is the focus of our debate.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s absolute commitment to town centres is highlighted by the fact that in Scotland, for the first time, we have a Government minister named as a dedicated minister for town centres. That underlines the &#8220;change of Government mindset&#8221;&#8212;to quote Malcolm Fraser&#8217;s comments on the town centre action plan. I know that Derek Mackay, the dedicated minister for town centres, will strain every sinew to be Scotland&#8217;s town centre champion.</p><p>There is not sufficient time to go into the action plan in great detail, but I wish to mention the town centre first principle that has been set forth in the plan. That approach will be pivotal in making a success of the action plan and not just saving but promoting our town centres. Across government, both local and national, it is vital that that presumption in favour of activity on our high streets is adhered to and, as the Federation of Small Businesses has said, becomes</p><p>&#8220;a core factor of decision-making&#8221;.</p><p>It is therefore incumbent on us all to monitor the application of that presumption across the public sector very carefully indeed, to ensure that the obvious decline that blights many of our town centres is halted and reversed. I know that we all want to see our town centres as vibrant places where people can shop, live, enjoy their leisure time and access relevant services. That is the challenge before us.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to work with COSLA to determine how the town centre first principle will work in practice. I welcome, too, the town centre housing fund, which will help bring empty properties in town centres back into use for affordable housing, and, as a member for Mid Scotland and Fife, I welcome the recently announced beneficiaries, including Coupar, Alva and Crieff. I also welcome the extension of the fresh start scheme and the business rates reduction on offer in those circumstances.</p><p>Of course, business rates are crucial to ensuring that our high streets survive in these difficult financial times. Having run a small business, I very well understand how much of a lifeline the small business bonus scheme has been. Since the scheme was introduced by this Scottish National Party Government in 2008, 5,800 businesses in Fife alone have benefited from it and saved &#163;45.7 million.</p><p>I have to ask why on earth the Labour Party has the small business bonus scheme in its sights. Why does it want Fife businesses to pay higher rates than businesses south of the border and why does it advocate pulling the rug from under Fife businesses that day and daily are struggling to make ends meet? People in Fife know that the small business bonus scheme is safe with the SNP&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22847317", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Town Centre Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I am a member of the cross-party group on towns and town centres, I am pleased to have been called to speak in the debate.

Indeed, it is forging ahead to pursue new funding avenues and to develop new projects.

In the summer, it was named as one of the best projects in the east of Scotland in the UK&#8217;s biggest parenting competition, run by netmums.com. As a taste of the sort of thing that the project does, there was a get cooking event at which young mums were taught to create tasty and healthy meals and to improvise with their ingredients while sticking to a low budget. The mums were able to relax and enjoy that experience safe in the knowledge that their children were having fun in the cr&#232;che that was provided by Fife childcare strategy. Local mums, dads, and childcarers have praised the Kirkcaldy teen parent project, calling it</p><p>&#8220;the highlight of our week.&#8221;</p><p>Parents have also told how the group was special to them for its</p><p>&#8220;caring staff, great range of activities for kids and for putting a smile on the face of everyone who attends.&#8221;</p><p>What an accolade and compliment to all those who are involved in the hard work of providing that service. It is great that the project has secured funding and will see its work continue for another year, as well as expanding and developing that service.</p><p>I congratulate everyone who is involved with Fife Gingerbread&#8212;whether as a worker, volunteer, fundraiser or service user&#8212;on their success with the teen parent project and the other great work that it does.

I am very pleased to hear of the range of successful trusts and other models of community engagement in other parts of Scotland. As an MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, I am pleased to report that there are a number of examples of successful development trusts across the region, from Callander Community Development Trust in the west across to the Levenmouth my bus operation in Fife and at many points in between.</p><p>All those development trusts are a tremendous credit to their communities and speak to the determination of local people to make a positive difference to the lives of their towns, villages and, indeed, in some cities, their neighbourhoods.</p><p>In the short time available to me, I will focus on an example that could not be closer to home: the Comrie Development Trust, which was established in 2006 in the village that I am proud to call my home. I point out that I am a member of the trust, along with more than 700 other people, and I also draw members&#8217; attention to my entry in the register of interests, which states that I did project support work for the trust some years ago.</p><p>From its inception, the Comrie Development Trust has gone from strength to strength. It may be most well known for successfully navigating the not inconsiderable hurdles to effecting the community buyout of the former Ministry of Defence army camp at Cultybraggan, just outside the village. That was a tremendous achievement for the volunteer board of the trust, whose determination to succeed was inspirational.</p><p>I well remember the excitement when the deal was secured, very much at the 11th hour, and I remember too the quiet delight of many villagers, who had never in all their years owned land&#8212;nor had generations of their families before them. They found themselves having a stake and therefore a say in what would happen to 90 acres of land on their doorstep.</p><p>Since the buyout of Cultybraggan, progress has been made on the community development of the site. Some of the Nissen huts have been refurbished and let out to local tradesmen and other businesses and groups, and an award-winning catering company has relocated to the site.</p><p>There has also been the establishment of very successful community allotments, alongside which Comrie in Colour, another Comrie voluntary organisation, has its very successful polytunnel. We have established a community orchard and I believe that planning permission has been obtained to develop sports facilities at the camp. We have renewables activity on the site and the trust is running a carbon challenge project in the village. Work is going on to create a heritage centre to reflect the site&#8217;s history as a prisoner of war camp during the second world war and, importantly, much input from local folk has been secured to capture the stories of that time.</p><p>A lot of work has been carried out and a lot of work is still to be done. Although funding has been secured by the trust to employ some members of staff over the years, it is fair to say that much of the impetus is still with the volunteer directors and the many other volunteers who are involved in the various working groups that the trust has set up. Without their tireless contribution, very little of what I have outlined would have been achieved.</p><p>I add my praise for my very local development trust to the debate. Although at the outset it was the new kid on the block among the community initiatives in Comrie&#8212;a village where there were already some 56 voluntary organisations, in addition to the excellent and hard-working community council&#8212;it is fair to say that the trust has become part of the firmament.</p><p>There is no monopoly on good ideas; nor should any ceiling be placed on enthusiasm and the determination to make a positive difference to the lives of a community. All volunteers share that estimable goal and there is space and, indeed, demand enough for everyone, working in co-operation with each other, to make their contribution.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22781963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Development Trusts and Community Initiatives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate my colleague Christine Grahame on securing this members&#8217; business debate.

There will therefore be a focus on the support of the partnership action for continuing employment programme in helping those skilled workers to find alternative employment.</p><p>Turning to the Labour motion, I find it encouraging that there is recognition that Scotland&#8217;s defence industry already plays a significant role not just at the UK level but further afield at the European level and indeed globally. To what can we ascribe that success? I submit that it is due to the skills of the workforce on the Clyde, at Rosyth and in our many electronic and high-tech defence companies, many of which Murdo Fraser listed.

It is clear that such a rationale will determine where the type 26 ships are built.</p><p>On &#8220;The Andrew Marr Show&#8221; on Sunday 10 November, no less an authority than the chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, confirmed that the Westminster Government</p><p>&#8220;will go and get our ships in the place where it makes the most sense&#8221;.</p><p>He went on to say that the BAE decision was</p><p>&#8220;very much a matter of a business rationalisation.

Ms Smith has been successful in securing for herself a number of headlines on the issue in the local press, but I have to say that they have not all been positive.

As we heard, the line was closed in the 1970s, but it is not like the many lines that fell victim to Dr Beeching&#8217;s mad-axe policy; it is not lying dormant, just waiting to be reopened. Rather, much of the route now lies beneath the M90 motorway, and other parts have been built on. People&#8217;s homes are a reality on not-insignificant sections of the route. Therefore, we are talking not about a direct route, but a circuitous route.

I, too, am not exactly well known for my golfing skills, although I say in my defence that I was quite the putter in the Queen&#8217;s Park putting green that was opposite the tenement in Glasgow that I grew up in. However, I know how important golf is to the local economy in Strathearn, in wider Perth and Kinross, in the kingdom of Fife and throughout Scotland.</p><p>I very much welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement that the Scottish Government will ensure that up to 50 young Scots receive help and training to volunteer at next year&#8217;s Ryder cup. That is an excellent initiative, and it is part and parcel of the package of Ryder cup measures and activities to involve young people and other people in volunteering and to maximise the opportunities for Scotland.</p><p>For locals and tourists alike, golf is a star attraction, and the excitement is mounting locally at the tantalising prospect of the 2014 Ryder cup, which will be held a mere 16 miles away from Comrie. I very much welcome the confirmation that shuttle buses will run between Crieff and Gleneagles via Auchterarder. It is fair to say that the concern had been expressed that locals and fans alike in Strathearn would have to go to the park-and-ride facilities in Perth, Stirling or Kinross, so it is good news that all the organisations and agencies that are involved in the comprehensive planning project for this fantastic event have factored in such local concerns.</p><p>The arrangements for the shuttle buses demonstrate the organisers&#8217; determination to facilitate local access during the competition and to promote local businesses, which is important. Specifically, those who will use the shuttle buses will need to demonstrate that they are local residents or that they have stayed overnight with a local accommodation provider. That is very welcome, and it provides a real fillip to local hotels, bed and breakfasts, chalets, lodges and other providers of tourist accommodation.</p><p>Indeed, I have seen that the marketing of local facilities is already well under way, with the prospect of transportation to the shuttle buses being laid on by tourist providers. I noted that, further to recent marketing by a provider of lodges in Comrie, in addition to free transport to Crieff complimentary rounds of golf are being offered at local courses such as those at Crieff and Comrie. That is an excellent initiative that shows how everything can pull together, with all of us acting together to get the most out of the experience. I imagine that at other courses in Strathearn, such as those in St Fillans, Muthill and Auchterarder, there will be the same enthusiasm to see what they can do to maximise opportunities, and I feel sure that that enthusiasm will be replicated across Mid Scotland and Fife and, I hope, beyond.</p><p>On local transport, it is of course very welcome that Gleneagles train station is to be significantly upgraded. We heard about the detail of that refurbishment from the minister. That is a very welcome local legacy of the Ryder cup.</p><p>Another key local transport issue is that trains are to stop at Dunblane. For those who are based a wee bit further south in Strathearn or who are staying in tourist accommodation to the south, that is very welcome, and it was warmly received locally.</p><p>As far as Auchterarder residents and businesses and those in the immediate vicinity are concerned, community engagement is on-going on local access, as there are key issues to be addressed. The on-going dialogue that has been referred to is vital to ensure that locally in Strathearn we can all enjoy the event and maximise the tremendous opportunities that are involved while ensuring that life can continue as normal or as normally as it possibly can.</p><p>The availability of updated information is crucial for the local community and fans alike. I am pleased to note that Perth and Kinross Council has created a dedicated website for the Ryder cup. There is a facility on that website to sign up for email information alerts. I am happy to have taken up that opportunity, so I expect soon to become perhaps a bit of an expert on the detail of the golfing activities, which I am not at this point.</p><p>I understand that traffic Scotland will play a key role on information updates, which will be important to ensure that all of us can move about. That is all very good news, and it paves the way for what will be a remarkable week in Strathearn and beyond.</p><p>The important issue of the legacy of hosting the Ryder cup has been referred to, and it has to be mentioned. In the minute or so that is left to me, I wish to highlight two other key aspects of the Ryder cup and what its legacy will mean.</p><p>The first is that the official charities comprise not only the excellent Quarriers charity, which has been mentioned, but Friends of St Margaret&#8217;s. St Margaret&#8217;s community hospital is in Auchterarder. The group recently set up its own website, and it is looking forward to the ballot. I understand that it will receive an allocation of tickets that it will be able to auction to raise money for local fundraising activities.</p><p>Perth &amp; Kinross Disability Sport is also to be an official charity. That organisation works closely with Perth and Kinross Council and a number of local groups to develop sport for people of all ages and abilities.</p><p>The fact that two local charities are involved is very important to ensure that the benefits of the cup are secured, given that an element of disruption will be involved.</p><p>The other legacy element that I will mention is the 2014 Ryder cup education resource. As we have heard, it is to be made available to all pupils and teachers in Scotland and is to be linked with the excellent clubgolf initiative, which has been widely praised by, among others, Mr Ted Bishop, who is the president of the PGA of America. It is the innovation involved that will be the mark of success of the educational tool.</p><p>The 2014 Ryder cup is a truly massive fixture, not only for our sporting calendar but for Scotland as a whole. The interest and substantial benefit to be derived extend well beyond the world of golf, albeit that it is the fact that Scotland is the home of golf that ensures that the spotlight of the world will be upon us when we welcome back the Ryder cup.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697799", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ryder Cup 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a resident of Comrie in Strathearn, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the Ryder cup, which is to be held at Gleneagles golf course next year.

The importance of the coal industry to several parts of the Mid Scotland and Fife region&#8212;in particular, the kingdom of Fife&#8212;is well-known. It is part of the fabric of Fife and of the area&#8217;s economic and social history.</p><p>In the present day, that interest is focused on the coaling that can still be carried out and on the concomitant jobs. It is also focused on the restoration of sites, which involves not only the vital environmental clean-up but&#8212;we hope&#8212;local jobs. The fact that the Scottish Government has recognised those two key objectives is to be welcomed. As we have heard, that is manifest in the minister&#8217;s establishment of the Scottish coal industry task force, which is co-chaired by him and the hugely respected Professor Russel Griggs. The membership of the task force is, rightly, wide. It has worked, and is working, collaboratively to find solutions to the various problems with which it has to deal.</p><p>I will highlight two of the task force&#8217;s successes that have already been referred to. The first is the successful lobbying of the Office of Rail Regulation on freight access charges to ensure that the original massive proposed hike of an additional charge of &#163;4.04 a tonne was reduced to a proposed increase of &#163;1.04 a tonne. Had the increase been implemented, the original proposal would have had a disastrous consequence for the viability of the coal industry and the prospects for the future development of clean coal electricity generation in Scotland and, therefore, for jobs.</p><p>Another success story for the task force concerns the need to ensure that the skills and experience that were acquired by former employees of SRG who had been made redundant could be duly recognised, absent the existence of any formal qualifications. That is important for the individuals concerned.</p><p>The successes to date have shown how practical steps that have been taken across the sector with everyone working together can make a real difference in improving the prospects for those who currently work in the industry and those who have had to seek alternative employment.</p><p>Of course, as we have been hearing from many members this afternoon, alongside the task force, the Scottish Mines Restoration Trust has been set up. That body, of course, is independent and has been tasked with facilitating innovative and dynamic solutions to the problem that we face with respect to restoration. I welcomed the setting up of the body, for it is implicit that, in finding solutions, one council cannot simply seek to act alone without input from other people. Councils must work together across the areas that are affected, and must bring together the public and private sectors in order to pool expertise and share best practice across the sector. That is a worthwhile approach. It is axiomatic that there is no identikit fix for each site. The specificities of each site must be taken into account in order to find solutions. It is also obvious&#8212;at least, in the real world&#8212;that the complex issues that are involved require solutions that it will, inevitably, take some time to come up with.</p><p>Sadly, there is no magic wand that we can wave at the issue in order to fix it overnight. That has been recognised by many people, including Fife Council, which&#8212;as Claire Baker mentioned&#8212;has been involved in the discussions for quite some time through the task force and with a variety of stakeholders. As we have heard, a tender has now been issued for restoration works at the Muir Dean site by Crossgates. That is credit to the hard work of everyone who has been involved, including all the officials behind the scenes. It is the hard work of those individuals that will make the difference, not the issuing of soundbites.</p><p>It is a pity that Willie Rennie did not consider that staying for the entirety of the debate was a priority in his diary, given that we are talking about the future of the coal industry in Scotland and its importance to people in Fife. It is also a pity that no other Liberal Democrat has sought to participate in the debate. If Mr Rennie had had the courtesy to take interventions from back benchers&#8212;several of us tried to intervene&#8212;I would have asked him whether his new Liberal Democrat policy to end coaling, which would turf thousands of people out of their jobs, is a Scotland-only policy that would not be applicable in the rest of the United Kingdom. With just about one year to go to the independence referendum, I do not think that the people of Scotland have got much to look forward to, if that is the Liberal Democrat vision for the future of the people of our country&#8212;including those who work in the opencast coaling sector.</p><p>I welcome the announcement today by the Scottish Government on whether we can seek to recover the levy that is paid by the coal industry to the Coal Authority&#8212;most of which, as we have heard, goes to the consolidated fund. That money could be well used to help with restoration works in Scotland. I hope&#8212;the Liberal Democrats&#8217; opposition to such a move notwithstanding&#8212;that we might get support from some of the other parties on that issue.</p><p>I also very much welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to consult on how we can secure better regulation and, therefore, a more effective approach to restoration. In my view, that is the practical way forward, and that is how best we can seek to find solutions for communities in Fife and elsewhere.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696519", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Opencast Mining"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the Scottish National Party MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to the debate.

That very phrase, which is set out on the front page of the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee&#8217;s stage 1 report, trips off the tongue very nicely indeed.</p><p>I, too, have the privilege of serving on the committee and want at the outset to record my thanks to the clerks, who worked incredibly hard to ensure that the committee progressed its work in a timely and productive manner. I also state for the record that notwithstanding the very significant differences in people&#8217;s outlook on this debate, the committee&#8217;s deliberations have in the main been carried out constructively and respectfully. I believe that that augurs very well for the progress of the referendum campaign itself, which the people of Scotland want to be conducted in a fair and reasonable way. They want a positive campaign that is focused on issues of importance, not characterised by endless negativity and sneering.</p><p>The first thing to note about the bill is that it has been made in Scotland for Scotland. That is important, because it ensures that our Parliament here in Edinburgh is responsible for deciding on our referendum&#8217;s legislative framework and that the elected representatives of the people of Scotland will establish the rules for the referendum on Scotland&#8217;s future. What could be more democratic than that? Is it not better for the referendum rules to be decided by the Scottish Parliament, which is trusted by the vast majority of the people of Scotland, instead of their being imposed by a Westminster Government that we did not vote for and which is not trusted by the vast majority of the people of Scotland?</p><p>Another key element of the bill is the extent to which the key provisions have been accepted as providing a fair and robust framework for the independence referendum that, as we have heard, meets the highest international standards and in which the people of Scotland can have confidence. For example, Michael Clancy of the Law Society of Scotland, who in his work here is not known to be overly fawning about legislation in general, told the committee:</p><p>&#8220;this is actually quite a well-drafted bill. Indeed, as you will see from our submission, we had very little difficulty with the drafting.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 9 May 2013; c 346.]</p><p>That is considerable praise indeed. We have also just heard the committee convener quote from John McCormick, electoral commissioner for Scotland, who also said that the bill was</p><p>&#8220;a strong piece of legislation&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, 23 May 2013; c 421.]</p><p>As its stage 1 report makes clear, the committee has been able to agree on a lot of things, including&#8212;crucially&#8212;its general principles. The report raises a number of technical points with a view to clarifying certain issues, and I very much welcome the Deputy First Minister&#8217;s confirmation that the Scottish Government is preparing to look at those issues and to bring forward amendments at stage 2.</p><p>Of course, as the convener also pointed out, we have no say on the purdah restrictions that will be applicable to the Westminster Government. There is per the Edinburgh agreement a gentleman&#8217;s agreement in place, which is why the committee noted in paragraph 189 of its report an asymmetry in this respect between the Scottish Government, which is subject to the purdah restrictions on a statutory basis, and the Westminster Government, which is not. In its recommendations, therefore, the committee has invited the Westminster Government to reconsider its position with a view to putting on a statutory footing the purdah provisions to which it, too, should be subject.</p><p>With regard to the question that will be posed in the referendum, notwithstanding all the fuss from some of the no lobby before the bill was introduced, the Electoral Commission&#8217;s recommendation on the wording of the question&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;Should Scotland be an independent country?&#8221;</p><p>&#8212;has in fact been accepted across the board. I believe that that sums up the general view of the bill&#8217;s status in Scotland at large; it is regarded as straightforward and clear and as establishing the proper framework to facilitate the people of Scotland&#8217;s decision about which of the two futures for Scotland they want.</p><p>I know what future I will be advocating to the people of Scotland&#8212;including, crucially, our 16 and 17-year-olds&#8212;in the referendum vote. I will advocate a prosperous and fair Scotland, in which decisions about our country are taken by the people who care most about it: those who live and work here. It is clear to me, and to an increasing number of voters, that to ensure such a future for our country and its people the answer to the question</p><p>&#8220;Should Scotland be an independent country?&#8221;</p><p>that will be posed on 18 September 2014 must be yes.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to be called to speak in this stage 1 debate on the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill.

That is what the people of Scotland trust the Parliament to do&#8212;to focus on measures that improve the lives of our citizens.</p><p>In the six minutes that are available to me, it would be impossible to do justice to each of the 13 new bills that are proposed, but I will make some comments about at least a few of them. Starting off from my trade as a lawyer, I will make a few comments about the weighty changes that are proposed to Scots law. In particular, I highlight the proposed courts reform bill, which is intended to bring the system of civil justice into the 21st century, thereby improving access to justice for our citizens and making it speedier, which will be welcome to all those who practise in the civil courts.</p><p>Another weighty bill in that area is the proposed damages bill, which will make long-overdue changes to damages for personal injury, inter alia by extending the time limit within which an action can be brought and by consolidating and updating existing legislation, as recommended by the Scottish Law Commission.</p><p>Both those bills are to be welcomed. As a former MP in the House of Commons, I can say without any hesitation that, if our Parliament in Edinburgh had not been reconvened, no such important modernisations of our legal system would have received such a focus. For Westminster Governments, Scots law reform was never top of the agenda or, for the most part, even on the agenda. There was neither the time nor the inclination to proceed with it. However, with our Parliament in Edinburgh, we can bring our procedural laws up to date to ensure that our legal system is fair and robust and, crucially, meets the needs of our citizens.</p><p>That is one of the many examples of the opportunities that flow from being able to take decisions about our country in our Parliament. As a member of the Welfare Reform Committee, I also mention the important Scottish welfare fund bill. It will provide a statutory footing for the Scottish welfare fund, which was set up in April this year.</p><p>I very much welcome the fact that, in setting up the fund, the Scottish Government recognised the importance of there being a safety net in our society for those who face hardship. That is a fundamental principle that, surely, must underpin any welfare system in a civilised country. However, again, the contrast must be made with the Westminster Government. It retains power over all other key aspects of the welfare system that affect people in Scotland, but it has removed the safety net for the most vulnerable citizens.</p><p>As we heard yesterday in the eloquent speech from my colleague Christina McKelvie MSP, the Westminster Government has reached a new nadir in its treatment of our most vulnerable citizens: people who are terminally ill, such as those with motor neurone disease, have been told by the United Kingdom Tory Government minister Lord Freud&#8212;who, I understand, previously acted as an adviser to the Blair-Brown Labour Government in Westminster&#8212;that the answer to being evicted under the bedroom tax would be to take in a lodger. Words fail me, but I am sure that people throughout Scotland will feel sick at heart&#8212;indeed, sick to their stomachs&#8212;about such inhumane treatment.</p><p>There is another future for Scotland. We do not need to put up with such appalling and obscene treatment of sick and vulnerable people by a Westminster Government for which we did not vote and that, according to most polls, most Scots do not trust. We can complete the powers of this Parliament by taking to ourselves power over welfare. We have shown that, with the limited power that we have with respect to the Scottish welfare fund, we can create a fair system based on civilised principles.</p><p>Surely it is a better future for the people who care most about Scotland&#8212;the people who live and work here&#8212;to take decisions about the welfare system that they would wish to operate in Scotland. Having heard Ms Baillie&#8217;s speech&#8212;her usual negative contribution to such debates&#8212;I say that I for one do not see why people in Scotland, and particularly our most vulnerable people, should accept the second-best approach and the limited ambition of mitigating the measures that have been taken by Governments that we have not voted for. Why do we not seek to have the power to take such decisions for ourselves?</p><p>It should be pointed out for the record that the SNP has said unequivocally that we would abolish the bedroom tax within one year of an independent Scotland taking its rightful place in the world. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, failed yet again today to commit to abolishing the bedroom tax. Ms Baillie should reflect on machinations in her political party before she comes to the chamber.</p><p>I mention as a member of the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee that, in addition to the 13 new bills that the First Minister set out yesterday, a number of bills are undergoing legislative scrutiny. They include the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill, which provides the framework for the vote in 2014. A yes vote is a vote for Scotland to get the tools that it needs to secure a prosperous and fair society. A yes vote means that decisions about Scotland are taken by those who care most about Scotland&#8212;the people who live and work here. Scotland&#8217;s future in Scotland&#8217;s hands&#8212;that sounds very good to me.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695490", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in the debate on the Scottish Government&#8217;s programme for 2013-14.

It is apt that we are having the debate in advance of the celebration of refugee week Scotland 2013, which commences next Monday. My colleague Christina McKelvie, who has had to leave, is hosting an event to celebrate that excellent initiative next week in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>As we have heard, the Scottish guardianship service was established as a pilot project in 2010, further to a commitment made by the Scottish National Party Scottish Government in its 2008 response to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. It should be acknowledged that the service was set up further to a lot of work behind the scenes by Aberlour Child Care Trust and the Scottish Refugee Council, which operate it. All credit should go to both those excellent organisations for the hard work that they did to set up the service and for the excellent way in which they have operated it since its inception.</p><p>As has been said, the service is non-statutory and operates independently. Its key focus is to provide support for children seeking asylum who find themselves separated from those who would otherwise have parental responsibility for them. Sadly, that includes many trafficked minors. The key recognition that underpins the service is that, aside from being extremely vulnerable and isolated, those children would, in the absence of the service&#8217;s support, find themselves at a severe disadvantage in their representation in the asylum process and, therefore, their ability to invoke their rights under the law.</p><p>The support that is provided is designed to ensure that those gaps are filled. That is secured by the institution of guardians. It is important to note for the record the definition of a guardian for the purposes of the guardianship service, as it differs in certain respects from the terminology that is employed in Scots law in general. A guardian is defined as</p><p>&#8220;someone who accompanies children and young people when they claim asylum or are trafficked and are cared for by health, education and welfare services. A Guardian will help a child or young person to be actively involved in decisions that affect their life and to get the help they need, when they need it. A Guardian is on the child&#8217;s side, can explain what is happening to them, will listen to their views and experiences and speak up for them when needed. A Guardian will also help a child or young person to plan their future&#8221;.</p><p>That definition sums up clearly what we are talking about in the debate.</p><p>In addition to ensuring that such children have somewhere that they can call home and that they have social contact and&#8212;as the minister mentioned&#8212;access to healthcare and education, the service makes a big difference in facilitating better decision making by UK Home Office caseworkers. That is because it means that much more information is available to the Home Office at the right time. At the same time, all the professionals who are involved work together and share information during the asylum process.</p><p>I understand that, since its inception, the guardianship service has supported more than 100 young people from countries such as Afghanistan, Nigeria, Vietnam, Iran and Somalia. Most&#8212;about three quarters&#8212;of those who have been supported are young males, and nearly a third of the young people have presented trafficking indicators that are associated with domestic servitude, sexual exploitation, cannabis production and the supply or sale of drugs.</p><p>As we have heard, after the initial pilot period ended, the service was evaluated by the learned Professors Kohli and Crawley earlier this year. It is significant to note that that independent evaluation found that some 80 per cent of stakeholders felt that the pilot had made young people&#8217;s lives better. That view was shared strongly by the young people. It is important to note that the evidence on asylum outcomes supports that conclusion. About 44 per cent of the young people who had a guardian and for whom an initial decision had been made secured refugee status or humanitarian protection. That compares with a rate of about 20 per cent in the UK more generally.</p><p>I am therefore very pleased&#8212;as I think that everyone in the chamber is&#8212;to note that the SNP Scottish Government has agreed to fund the service for the next three years. That will allow key support to some of the world&#8217;s most vulnerable children to continue to be provided. The continued funding will also allow the service to build on the experience that has been gained over the first three years and to develop best practice.</p><p>As for the suggestions that were made in the Barnardo&#8217;s briefing, as I did not receive that briefing&#8212;and nor, it seems, did some of my colleagues&#8212;I cannot comment on them in any detail.</p><p>It is a credit to everyone involved that the service is going from strength to strength. I reserve particular praise for the guardians, who are making such a difference to the lives of the young people concerned.</p><p>We have heard about the interesting paragraph in the report on the human rights of separated children that Westminster&#8217;s Joint Committee on Human Rights published yesterday, which suggested that the Scottish guardianship service could serve as a model for the commissioning of pilot projects elsewhere in the UK. That is very much to be welcomed. However, from the time that I spent at Westminster as the MP for Perth and my constant battles with the then Labour Blair-Brown Westminster Government over the disgrace that was the detention of children of asylum seekers in detention centres such as Dungavel, I am afraid that I am not particularly sanguine about the prospect of a speedy response from Westminster on the issue. We can but hope.</p><p>Fortunately, in Scotland, at least on the matters that the guardianship service covers, we can continue to forge ahead in meeting our international commitments, while recognising that Westminster retains&#8212;although not for much longer, I hope&#8212;sole jurisdiction over asylum policy and procedures.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693870", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Guardianship Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am pleased to have been called to speak in the debate on the Scottish guardianship service, which we can all agree is groundbreaking.

Although I am not a member of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, I most certainly have, as a member of the Parliament for Mid Scotland and Fife, an interest in the crossings over the Forth.</p><p>As I was returning to Edinburgh across the Forth road bridge the other evening, I was struck once again by what a magnificent feat of engineering it is. That also holds true for the iconic Forth rail bridge, and I welcome the fact that it is being nominated for a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization world heritage site award.</p><p>It is also to be welcomed that the Scottish Government has just launched a 12-week consultation seeking views on the benefits that a successful bid could deliver for the local communities. I gently say to Alex Johnstone that those benefits would accrue not only to Edinburgh but to the kingdom of Fife; that applies to the benefits of the new crossing with regard to tourism, education, and skills and innovation.</p><p>The naming process for the new crossing has been an excellent example of engagement with the public. The shortlist of five names was agreed by a distinguished panel, so it was not for individual back benchers&#8212;or the Scottish Government&#8212;to come up with names, as Helen Eadie seemed to suggest. The panel has come up with an excellent list of five possible names, so I found it very difficult to make my choice. I have just done so online; for good historical reasons, I have&#8212;like my Fife colleague David Torrance&#8212;chosen St Margaret&#8217;s crossing. I hasten to stress to Alex Johnstone, who is smiling hopefully at me, that my choice had nothing to do with recent historic political events.</p><p>I was impressed by the process, and I encourage as many people as possible to go online, to phone or to text&#8212;whichever method they prefer&#8212;and to make their vote count, because it is very much a people&#8217;s naming contest, as it should be. Such examples of public engagement augur very well for the contribution that the Forth bridges forum will make, as it will play a central role in ensuring that the interests of local people are at the core of management and maintenance of the Forth bridges.</p><p>We have heard much this afternoon about the detail of the Forth Road Bridge Bill. The bill&#8217;s principal objective is to facilitate the most cost-effective and co-ordinated approach to management and maintenance of the new Forth crossing and the Forth road bridge. It seems to me that contracting management and maintenance for both the bridges to a single bridge-operating company makes most sense, and will certainly provide best value for the taxpayer, who is under a great deal of pressure at present.</p><p>I am very happy indeed that the key issue of staff terms and conditions, which has been highlighted by many members&#8212;my colleague Jim Eadie, in particular, spent some considerable time on this&#8212;has been fully and properly addressed by the minister, such that FETA staff&#8217;s rights and terms and conditions will be protected under TUPE. I welcome that. To have that assurance in the bill will provide enormous comfort to the excellent staff of FETA, although I am pleased to note that there will be opportunities for additional positions with the new operating company. I also welcome the minister&#8217;s assurance that the Scottish Government will act as guarantor for the important pension rights.</p><p>In conclusion I say that, given that those key issues have been addressed, I am very pleased indeed to support the passage of the bill this afternoon.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692097", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Forth Road Bridge Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in the stage 3 debate on the Forth Road Bridge Bill.

I, too, thank all those who gave evidence, SPICe and our committee advisers, and I thank the clerks for their efficient handling thus far of the franchise bill.</p><p>As we have heard this afternoon, the franchise bill makes provision for the franchise that is to be applicable for the independence referendum to be held on 18 September 2014. Broadly speaking, the franchise will be the same as that for the 1997 devolution referendum&#8212;that is, it will be based on the local government register in Scotland. The approach of both the 1997 devolution referendum and the upcoming 2014 independence referendum reflects what is widely regarded as best international practice on referenda, whereby residency is considered to be the most appropriate criterion for setting the right to vote. It is interesting to note that the committee unanimously agreed with that approach. In that regard, I refer the Parliament to paragraph 29 of the committee&#8217;s report.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s deliberations on the franchise bill were broadly of a consensual nature, which is a credit to all members of the committee, but particularly to those who represent the unionist parties, who, it is probably fair to say, did not have the holding of an independence referendum as an overriding objective in the first place.</p><p>As far as the franchise is concerned, there is one key difference from the approach that was taken in the 1997 referendum, and that concerns the extension of the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds. I am delighted that some 120,000 of our citizens aged 16 and 17 will be able to register to vote in the independence referendum. I speak as a long-term supporter of a reduction in the voting age to 16. That has been a long-term objective of the Scottish National Party. Indeed, I recall that my mother, Winnie Ewing, in her maiden speech in the House of Commons following her sensational victory in the Hamilton by-election in 1967, called for a reduction in the voting age from the then minimum age of 21 years to 18 years, with a marker being laid for future reductions.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690779", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a member of the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee, I am pleased to have been called to speak in this stage 1 debate on the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill.

For the sake of completeness, I note that the evidence that we received on the lowering of the voting age was not unanimously in favour, as one individual made a submission against the proposition. As far as committee members are concerned, there was agreement except&#8212;as we have heard this afternoon&#8212;from the Conservative Party.</p><p>On the issue of lowering the voting age in general, again, the Scottish National Party is in favour of that for all forms of election. It is not clear from what Annabel Goldie said today what the Conservative Party position is, and it is certainly not clear what the Labour position is. Labour members talk about being in support, but they also talk about simply actively looking at the matter in terms of their 2015 Westminster manifesto. Perhaps they will clarify their position this afternoon. What is clear is that a yes vote in 2014 will secure for this Parliament powers over the voting age for all elections that are held in Scotland, and that is how it should be.</p><p>In the time that I have remaining, I will touch on another key aspect of the franchise, and that is the issue of service personnel. Again, the approach to be adopted in the independence referendum is the same as that which was adopted in the 1997 devolution referendum. The right of service personnel to vote follows the arrangements that are already in place.</p><p>I quote the Advocate General for Scotland, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, who said during the section 30 order debate in the House of Lords:</p><p>&#8220;Members of the Armed Forces will be able to vote in the referendum if they are on the register in Scotland either as a result of an address in Scotland or a qualifying address showing a connection to Scotland, such as service accommodation in Scotland; an address in Scotland where they would be living if they were not in the services; or an address in Scotland where they have lived in the past. The same rules apply to spouses and civil partners of members of the Armed Forces.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, House of Lords, 16 January 2013; Vol 742, c 754.]</p><p>That is very welcome, and it is as it should be. The committee was happy to endorse that position. One issue that has arisen concerns the position of 16 and 17-year-old children who are still living with service personnel who are resident furth of Scotland.

I, too, pay tribute to the admirable determination of the petitioner, Professor David Crichton, in ensuring that the petition was lodged, and of course now we have the opportunity to debate it.</p><p>This is indeed an important debate in light of the very significant impact that flooding has on people&#8217;s lives. It has had a very miserable impact across Scotland, as we know&#8212;in Cowdenbeath, in Perthshire and in many other parts of Scotland.</p><p>There is not just the horror of the water coming in, as happened in Comrie, the village that I am very pleased to call home, on 27 August and again, sadly, on 19 November last year. The problem is not just the damage to precious and, in many cases, irreplaceable possessions. It is not just the smell that is left in the house and the dampness that creeps up the wall&#8212;Elaine Murray is nodding, as she will remember exactly what it felt like in her office after the incidents in Dumfries. In the case of the family home in particular, it is not just the need to evacuate, with the endless months of being relocated, packing and unpacking, being inconvenienced and living out of suitcases, which is especially unsettling for families with children.</p><p>Another absolutely miserable impact in, I believe, far too many cases is the requirement to have constant arguments with the insurance company&#8212;at a time when people may be vulnerable emotionally&#8212;when all that people want to do is to secure what they are entitled to under the policy for which, in many cases, they will have already paid handsomely.</p><p>A useful study for the ABI might be to look at a double flood event such as happened in Comrie, where two floods occurred within a short space of time, to see how the insurance industry fared in treating its policyholders. Such a case study would provide useful feedback to the ABI and its members and they would be able to see whether they rose to the occasion by treating their policyholders within not just the letter but the spirit of their contractual obligations. As far as I am aware, in far too many cases in Comrie the verdict would be that there was considerable room for improvement.</p><p>Of course, the misery that people experience from a flood does not end with the flood event itself, with subsequently signing off the deal that has been reached with the insurance company&#8212;which may happen many months after the fact and after much tortuous to-ing and fro-ing&#8212;or with getting back into the family home. Many people in Comrie were just about to get back into their home when the second flood hit them. However, the misery is not over then because, when people then try to renew their policy, they are often quoted a vastly increased sum of money for their insurance premium and the entirely unrealistic excesses that we have heard about, which render the cover nugatory. Frankly, an excess of &#163;4,000 is ridiculous. Recently, a policyholder in Comrie contacted me to say that when she tried to renew her policy with the company that she had been with for quite some time, she was quoted an increase in her premium of some 250 per cent.</p><p>That brings me to the very crux of this afternoon&#8217;s debate, which is about what can be done to ensure that insurance companies base their premiums for policyholders in Scotland on the facts. How do we ensure that premiums are based on a proper risk assessment that takes due account of both the circumstances in Scotland as a whole, in terms of our Government&#8217;s policy positioning, and the local circumstances in different parts of Scotland where remedial works have been undertaken?</p><p>I very much welcome the strenuous efforts of the Scottish Government to seek to make Scotland&#8217;s voice heard in the on-going discussions between the ABI and the UK department DEFRA, with the looming expiry of the statement of principles. However, we must recall that the regulation of the insurance industry is a reserved matter. That is a fundamentally important point because it means that, at the end of the day, there is no way to ensure that any deal done is properly reflective of Scottish interests.</p><p>As we have heard, there is a continuing fear that, through increased premiums and excesses, policyholders in Scotland will pay increasing cross-subsidies to deal with the much greater flooding risk south of the border, where, for reasons that are unfathomable, risks are simply being ignored in local planning policy. It is important to recall that, whereas in Scotland one in 22 properties are at risk from flooding, south of the border the equivalent ratio is in the order of one in six. That speaks for itself, and it begs the question: why should policyholders in Cowdenbeath or Comrie pay higher premiums to subsidise policyholders south of the border?</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690227", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Flood Insurance Problems"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am very pleased to speak in this important debate, held at the instigation of the Public Petitions Committee, on flood insurance problems.

As we have heard, the plans to close five Crown post offices with a view to selling them as franchises in retail outlets pose a real threat to the service that is provided to customers in the areas that would be affected. Those areas include two in Mid Scotland and Fife&#8212;Perth and Alloa. My colleague Keith Brown hopes to speak about the Alloa Crown post office, as it falls within his constituency, so I will focus on the one in Perth, although I put on the record the fact that I share Keith Brown&#8217;s concerns about the situation with the Alloa office, which he has expressed. I am sure that he will expand on those concerns this evening.</p><p>In Perth, my colleague Pete Wishart, the Scottish National Party member of Parliament for Perth and North Perthshire, has been working with local representatives of the CWU to set up a public meeting, which is to be held on Thursday 2 May at 7 pm in the A K Bell library. I hope that there will be good attendance on the night. I welcome to the public gallery representatives from the CWU. I am pleased that they have made an effort to come and hear the debate, because I know how worried CWU members are about the possible effects on their livelihoods.</p><p>The franchising of the Crown post offices is a worrying development that seriously undermines the credibility of the Post Office as a national service provider. The treatment of members of staff and the uncertainty that is being created are not good enough. I believe that the proposal cloaks a restriction in services in the guise of improvements for the customer. The reality is that no one will truly benefit from the plans&#8212;they are simply the next stage in the ideologically driven privatisation of the postal service.</p><p>Extended opening hours might be welcomed, but not if there is a concomitant reduction in the services that are available to the customer. It is one thing for sub-post offices to supplement their income from postal services, particularly in rural settings where they might be the only retail outlet in a village, but I am talking about a Crown post office on one of the main thoroughfares through the city of Perth. Frankly, people should not have to struggle past tins of beans to renew their passport. Real concerns have been raised about proper access and convenience for the elderly, the disabled and parents with buggies.</p><p>When the Post Office announced its intention to close or franchise 20 per cent of the remaining network of Crown post offices across the UK, fears were immediately raised about job security for the 800 or so people who work in those offices, along with uncertainty for the future of other Crown post offices. I am not convinced that the Post Office will be successful in securing the franchise opportunities that it seems to think exist, because to me the scheme bears all the hallmarks of something that has been drawn up by someone in an office somewhere who has a numerical target to hit and a map, but not a single clue about the actual circumstances of the post offices in Perth and elsewhere.</p><p>The post office premises on Perth&#8217;s South Street are superbly situated because they are in the centre of downtown Perth and are well frequented. Anyone who has used the service or walked by at its busiest time will see that, even with all the counters staffed, the queues can be lengthy because of the number of people who want to transact their business there. It is difficult to see how that situation can be improved. Indeed, the service would probably deteriorate in smaller premises.</p><p>No Post Office staff should be left in this situation. They should be allowed to get on with what they do best, which is to serve the customers&#8212;the people of Perth&#8212;with a full range of Post Office services.

It was prepared by Professor Steve Fothergill and Professor Christina Beatty of Sheffield Hallam University. The committee had the pleasure of speaking directly with Professor Fothergill at its evidence session last week and of making further inquiries about the report.</p><p>It is important to note at the outset that the report makes no comment on the merits or otherwise of the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reforms. Rather, as Professor Fothergill said:</p><p>&#8220;It is about tracking the impact of the reforms on Scotland as a whole and on each of the constituent local authorities in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>Another important point to note is that the figures in the report</p><p>&#8220;are all rooted in official Government statistics.&#8221;</p><p>Alex Fergusson might not have been paying attention to that point at last week&#8217;s committee meeting. Yet another important point to note is the fact that the report does not cover the move from the RPI to the CPI for uprating, and Professor Fothergill explained his rationale by saying:</p><p>&#8220;that is a much wider public sector accounting reform that affects a wide range of public sector pensions, as well as benefits.&#8221;</p><p>The report&#8217;s key conclusion that the UK Government welfare reforms will take more than &#163;1.6 billion a year out of the Scottish economy should be seen against the backdrop of the report&#8217;s parameters.

Many did not return, and many who returned still count the cost. My thoughts are very much with them and their families today.</p><p>It is important that we ensure that the sacrifice of those soldiers is never forgotten; this debate affords this Parliament the opportunity to remember them, as we look to ensure that never again will we in Scotland be dragged into an illegal war, based on lies. I say to Jenny Marra, further to her extraordinary remarks this afternoon, that she might wish to examine her conscience and reflect on how she sought to drag the families of those brave soldiers into her political machinations.</p><p>We were served with lies by Tony Blair and his Labour ministers because, as we have heard, there were no weapons of mass destruction. If they really were the concern, why the rush to war? Why were the weapons inspectors not given more time, as they requested? Why did the UK Government simply turn its back on the United Nations and the force of international law when its attempts to secure a second resolution were proving to be unsuccessful? Surely we can call that action reckless and illegal, as an outcome. It was not about clairvoyance and looking into a crystal ball; it was about looking at the evidence. That was the duty that we parliamentarians had to discharge.</p><p>As we have heard, in the run up to the start of the Iraq war 10 years ago hundreds of thousands of people in Scotland and in London took to the streets to say, &#8220;Not in my name&#8221;, but their voices were simply ignored by the Labour Party. Last week we saw the unedifying spectacle of the Labour Party in this Parliament trying to shut down the debate today. Have they learned nothing from history? Do they wish to learn nothing from history? Perhaps it is implicit in their denial that they are culpable in the matter.</p><p>In conclusion, I say that I want never again to see my country being dragged into an illegal war such as Labour&#8217;s war in Iraq. Let us be very clear; this was Labour&#8217;s war. It was made possible by the character, nature and modus operandi of the Labour Party under the leadership of Tony Blair and&#8212;of course&#8212;its supine members of Parliament.</p><p>The constitution has been mentioned this afternoon, and it is entirely proper that we talk about that today and any day of the week in our Parliament, because the only way that we can ensure that Scotland will never again be dragged into an illegal war by a UK Government is to secure the normal powers of an independent country. It is only with independence that we can participate in the world in our own right and speak with our own voice.</p><p>Independence would also ensure that we, as a sovereign Parliament, could choose whether or not to send our young men and women into conflicts.

I congratulate my fellow Fife MSP David Torrance on securing this timely debate.</p><p>I extend my warmest congratulations to Fife Gingerbread on its 25th anniversary. What a credit to all those involved in setting up Fife Gingerbread 25 years ago and to all those who have, over the years, worked tirelessly to support its excellent work. I commend the hard-working staff members and, importantly, all the volunteers who have given of their time and enthusiasm to make a real difference to the lives of lone-parent families.</p><p>As we have heard, Fife Gingerbread is a voluntary organisation that works with lone-parent families throughout Fife to provide practical help, support and information. It does that through traditional project models and through very innovative project models. I will return to that briefly in a moment, but it is important to highlight one of Fife Gingerbread&#8217;s landmark achievements, which is the breaking down of the completely erroneous and misleading stereotype that lone parents are primarily teenagers and&#8212;if the more lurid tabloids are to be believed&#8212;that they are teenagers who became pregnant deliberately to get a council house and benefits. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>In relation to the stereotyping that goes on when some people talk about lone-parent families, notwithstanding what my colleague David Torrance said about the incidence of teen pregnancy, we need simply to look at the study by One Parent Families Scotland, entitled &#8220;One Parent Families&#8212;A Profile&#8221;, which was published in August 2009, to see that only 2 per cent of lone-parent mothers are teenagers.</p><p>The stereotype is not only entirely manufactured and insulting; it also fails to take account of the fact that many lone parents find themselves in that position as a result of relationship breakdown, bereavement or fleeing from the home because of domestic abuse. Understanding the nature of the issues that face lone parents is key. If we do not understand those issues, we cannot do our best to help them properly.</p><p>Fife Gingerbread is exemplary in that respect. Through its pioneering buddy project, to which David Torrance referred, it has shown what can be done to bring about step changes in lone-parent families&#8217; lives. The project&#8217;s success is in its focus on the parent of the child or children, providing them with practical help and aiming to inspire individuals to have confidence to grow and develop.</p><p>Another excellent initiative is the provision of a dedicated student support worker, who helps people to address barriers to pursuing further education or training. I do not have time to describe all the many other excellent initiatives. What has struck me about Fife Gingerbread&#8217;s success is the number of self-initiated referrals&#8212;the rate is 25 per cent&#8212;which testifies to the high regard in which Fife Gingerbread is rightly held.</p><p>A major cloud on the horizon is the looming United Kingdom Government welfare cuts, which are expected to have a significant negative impact on lone-parent families, as on other vulnerable individuals across Scotland. I know that Fife Gingerbread will do what it can to provide support and clear information. However, the only way to secure the welfare system that we in Scotland want is to ensure that it is our Parliament here in Edinburgh, and not a Tory Government in London that the people of Scotland did not vote for, that controls welfare.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685011", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fife Gingerbread (Support for Lone Parents)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the SNP member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region and a member of the Welfare Reform Bill Committee, I am very pleased indeed to have been called to speak in the debate.

Who could have contemplated that the UK Government would go where even Mrs Thatcher feared to tread by means testing child benefit? One might have safely assumed that such a miserly and fundamentally ill-judged course of action was off the agenda, even for the Tories, when the current chancellor George Osborne said in his address to the party faithful at the 2009 Tory party conference:</p><p>&#8220;We will preserve child benefit, winter fuel payments and free TV licences.

We hear that it will cost around &#163;113&#160;million to &#163;118&#160;million of public money to administer the system over the first four years. Of course, that should not come as a surprise, because means testing is costly and unduly complex and impacts negatively on take-up of benefits.

Even approaching the 10-year mark, nearly a third of pensioners who are eligible for pension credit are not taking it up as a result of means testing.</p><p>It is not just the cuts in child benefit that are hammering hard-pressed families in Scotland. We are seeing a head-on assault on the welfare system, which is supposed to provide the safety net that is the mark of a decent society. We have heard about the miserable 1 per cent uprating cap for child benefit and the impact that that will have. We have heard about changes to the tax credit system, which again will impact on hard-pressed families and their children. We have also heard about the ridiculous and unfair bedroom tax and the huge impact that that will have on households across Scotland.</p><p>I could go on, but I am conscious of the time.

As we have heard, it is indeed a most timely debate in light of the fact that the Scottish Government is in the process of updating the biodiversity strategy, further to the recent consultation that it engaged in, to which members have referred. I am also pleased that the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee will play a key role in examining the updated biodiversity policy. I believe that that is entirely appropriate and, having until recently had the pleasure of being the deputy convener of the committee, I know that the committee members will discharge their duties impeccably.</p><p>The debate is also timely because, as a few speakers in the debate have said, we have already seen the launch in 2013 of the year of natural Scotland. It is a Scottish Government initiative, with SNH as lead partner working with VisitScotland, EventScotland and various partner organisations on the ground; its aim is of course to promote Scotland&#8217;s stunning natural beauty and biodiversity and to promote opportunities for visitors to enjoy Scotland&#8217;s fantastic landscapes, wildlife and heritage. It is therefore entirely fitting that we are exploring issues of biodiversity, focusing on how we can seek to meet the various challenges ahead, which speakers in the debate have discussed in some detail.</p><p>I stress that, as much as the natural world is, as we have heard, a significant contributor to Scotland&#8217;s economic growth, it is in and of itself a key part of life and it adds to our quality of life. The importance of the natural world has long been recognised in Scotland. For example, we have heard the words of the naturalist Frank Fraser Darling, as quoted by Rob Gibson, the convener of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee; we have heard the words of John Muir, the conservation pioneer, as quoted by the minister; and, to give an international outlook, we have heard the words of a famous Senegalese conservationist, as quoted by Alex Fergusson. As we are coming into the Burns season, it might be appropriate to quote the bard himself, who wrote in his world famous poem &#8220;To a Mouse&#8221;:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m truly sorry man&#8217;s dominion,</p><p>Has broken Nature&#8217;s social union&#8221;.</p><p>Robert Burns revered nature. I suppose it is debatable whether he revered nature as much as he revered the lassies, but perhaps that is a debate for another day.</p><p>However, the need that Robert Burns expressed so well for living in harmony with the natural world is one that I believe is shared by most people. It is important to say that it is certainly the case that, down through the centuries, our farmers and crofters have acted as stewards of the land and that they continue to do so. They have always sought to secure a balance between our ecological systems and land management. Indeed, if it had not been for their stewardship, we would not see today the wide diversity of our natural world, which is there for all to enjoy. Jim Hume mentioned the discussions on greening the CAP, and it is important to stress that, as far as Scotland is concerned, the measures are unworkable. Surely that flags up the dangers to biodiversity that the implementation of the greening measures as they stand would cause for our landscape in Scotland and the promotion of greater biodiversity. I believe that we should resist them forcibly.</p><p>It has been recognised this afternoon that we have not met targets&#8212;along with just about everybody else in the world, but that does not make it right&#8212;so we have to strive to do better. Many speakers have recognised that that is an issue for each of us as well as for our local authorities and our Governments. That means that we need to listen carefully to the views that are expressed by all those who have knowledge and experience and therefore have something to contribute to the debate on how we can do more to preserve and maintain Scotland&#8217;s biodiversity.</p><p>An example of good practice can be seen in the biodiversity work that is undertaken by the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority, which launched its first biodiversity action plan for 2008 to 2011 and refreshed the plan more recently in its &#8220;National Park Partnership Plan 2012-2017&#8221;. In that work, there is recognition that the valued biodiversity of the park has been greatly shaped by the traditional land uses of food production and, indeed, field sports. With that underlying recognition, the stated goal is&#8212;I quote from the foreword to the 2008 to 2011 plan by the chief executive of the park authority&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;to combine the benefits from that long history of land management with the more recent concept of biodiversity.&#8221;</p><p>The chief executive went on to state:</p><p>&#8220;If we get it right, we can maintain a living, working landscape while also producing more robust and more self-sustaining ecosystems on a large scale that have a greater capacity to remain viable in the long-term in the face of climate change and other pressures.&#8221;</p><p>That is the goal that we should all be striving for.</p><p>I end with a point that most members have mentioned in their speeches. More education is needed for us all&#8212;for our children in schools, but also through less traditional channels in order to reach as wide an audience as possible&#8212;on the crucial need to change behaviour to promote and secure greater biodiversity.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681867", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Biodiversity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am pleased to have been called to speak in this debate on biodiversity.

Few issues are more important than helping young people find their way in life through getting a job, earning a wage and contributing to the society in which they live. I know that that is what young people want&#8212;indeed, are desperate&#8212;to do and believe that for them it is as much a matter of pride, of being able to pursue a particular interest, of taking responsibility for their own lives, of proving their abilities, of earning trust and of gaining confidence as it is of earning a wage and contributing to their communities and to society at large. It is therefore incumbent on us all to work together to promote youth employment, particularly in these very difficult economic times. That is what our constituents want us to do&#8212;they want us to work hard across the parties to get a result for our young people.</p><p>In her opening remarks, the Scottish Government&#8217;s dedicated Minister for Youth Employment&#8212;and I mean &#8220;dedicated&#8221; in both senses of the word&#8212;told us about the plethora of activities that the Scottish Government is pursuing to improve our young people&#8217;s employment prospects. The fact that we have the first ever dedicated Minister for Youth Employment since the Scottish Parliament was reconvened in 1999 speaks volumes about the absolute priority that the SNP Government places on tackling youth employment. At the same time, the Scottish Government has recognised that the post must be backed with resources, and we have heard this afternoon about the additional public funding that has recently been allocated to tackle youth employment.</p><p>However, it must be said that as long as the Scottish Government does not have the full economic powers of a normal independent country we will be tackling this key issue with at least one hand tied behind our backs. At present&#8212;and in advance of securing the support of the people of Scotland in a yes vote in 2014&#8212;it is clear that this SNP Scottish Government is using all the tools and levers at its disposal to promote youth employment.

I have wasted far too much time on Mr Henry&#8217;s disgusting comments, but I wanted to put that on the record. I hope that his comments could perhaps be reflected upon further over the course of the afternoon.</p><p>I am pleased to have been called to speak in the debate. It could perhaps be termed the future of Scotland 2, since I recall that only a few weeks ago I was pleased to be called to speak in the future of Scotland 1&#8212;perhaps, on reflection, given the negativity, we could have called it &#8220;Bleak House&#8221;.</p><p>There would have been a welcome for the sequel debate&#8212;it could have been a blockbuster hit&#8212;if Labour had sought to focus on the key substantive policy issues facing Scotland, such as Trident renewal or UK welfare cuts; if the focus had been on defining Labour&#8217;s vision for Scotland in the years to come; and if Labour had been keen to use its Opposition day debate to discuss what hope it could offer the citizens of our country for a brighter future for them and their families. Sadly, what we have heard today and in the debate a few weeks ago is the limitless negativity of the Labour Party; the complete lack of vision that Labour members all seem to share for their country; their apparent contentedness to strive for so little for their fellow citizens; their preference for Tory rule on welfare rather than home rule; and their preference to spend billions of pounds on nuclear weapons rather than on schools and hospitals for our citizens.</p><p>In contrast, I and my SNP colleagues will place no ceiling on the ambition of our people and country. We will not say&#8212;as Labour and the anti-independence parties do&#8212;that we can go so far but no further, or that, for some reason, we should accept second best; we will not say that we are not capable of taking our own decisions and that we should have somebody else making them for us. It is, of course, the people who care most about our country who are best placed to take decisions that affect our country&#8212;that means the people who live and work here.</p><p>The historic Edinburgh agreement paves the way for the independence referendum and, crucially, for an agreed framework through which the process can be secured. To pick up on one element of the debate, that agreement in turn provides the basis for legal advice to be sought from the law officers, including on EU membership. That, to me, seems axiomatic.</p><p>What I have found curious about the debate, in interventions from the Opposition parties, is the lack of any understanding about the fundamental principles underlying the EU and how it operates in practice. It has always been and remains the case that the EU is an inclusive organisation, which is open for membership to all countries that have a land area on the European continent and which share common democratic principles and respect for human rights. The idea that&#8212;somehow uniquely&#8212;Scotland would not be welcome is, frankly, ludicrous. As the cabinet secretary says, that lacks any credibility.</p><p>The next point to bear in mind is that we have been&#8212;as the excellent contribution from my colleague Aileen McLeod made clear&#8212;in the EU for some 40 years. We are EU citizens and we have certain rights. It is also to be recalled that it is difficult to get out of the EU&#8212;we need look only at the instance of Greenland some years ago in that respect.</p><p>As a matter of law, it is clear that Scotland is in the EU and that it will stay in the EU. It will be in exactly the same position as the rest of the UK in relation to international law on successor states.

I, too, am not a member of the Justice Committee. I think that I am the third non-member to speak; we should form a new group&#8212;[Interruption.] However, as the Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs prompts me to say, I am a member of the Law Society of Scotland and hold a current practising certificate. In the past, I have been on the registers of civil and criminal legal aid practitioners. That is important to put on the record, as far as I understand the rules.</p><p>As we have heard from many members, part 1 of the bill proposes to establish a new civil justice council, which will replace and expand on the functions of the Sheriff Court Rules Council and the Court of Session Rules Council. The new council will be under the Lord President&#8217;s direction and oversight, and the Scottish Court Service will provide secretariat support.</p><p>Consequently, there will be a single body, which will afford greater coherence in the structure for setting court rules. I understand that the proposal has been widely welcomed as a positive development in the determination to improve the justice system&#8217;s operation in Scotland.</p><p>I note and have heard this afternoon that, further to the Justice Committee&#8217;s scrutiny of part 1, issues have arisen in relation to the council&#8217;s remit and composition, on which I will make a few comments. The committee has&#8212;rightly&#8212;sought clarification of the likely scope of the new council&#8217;s proposed policy role, given the key doctrine of the separation of powers. I was pleased to note that the cabinet secretary confirms in his response, dated 18 October 2012, to the committee&#8217;s stage 1 report that the council&#8217;s role in policy making will be &#8220;essentially advisory&#8221;. In effect, he confirms that the bill will not impinge on the doctrine of the separation of powers.</p><p>As for the new council&#8217;s composition, I note that the committee raised issues about the need to ensure proper representation of the interests of not only what could perhaps be termed the usual justice suspects but&#8212;importantly&#8212;end users. A number of members have made that point. My reading of the bill is that a balance between those two groups is being sought. I note that it is to be at the discretion of the Lord President to flesh that out in practice when he has the opportunity to appoint six additional members. From reading the report, I note that the Lord President has given assurances to the committee that a wide range of interests and users will be represented and that, given that the council&#8217;s initial priority will be drafting the new, updated rules of court, there will be a need for specialist legal input at the outset.</p><p>From the representations that we have all, I think, received from different bodies, it seems that it is not just the legal profession that wants more places. David McLetchie referred to that issue. I think that it wants equivalence with the current position, which is five solicitor members, but it would have two. Groups such as Citizens Advice Scotland and representatives from the insurance industry are also lobbying for more places.</p><p>As I said in my intervention on Lewis Macdonald, I believe that we must strike a balance, as the council must be able to operate and not become unwieldy. That point was well made by the cabinet secretary. I also said earlier in an intervention that I believe that, as a matter of practice, a lot of the detailed work, which is far and away the most important work that will be done, will be carried out by specialist subject committees rather than at the full council level.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675001", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in this stage 1 debate on the Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Bill.

That is an important concession that has been made, which reflects issues that have been raised this afternoon on the composition of the council.</p><p>It is obvious that, in the final minute or so that is available to me, I do not have enough time to go into detail on the bill&#8217;s criminal legal assistance provisions but, as I mentioned in an earlier intervention, it seems to me that the key purpose is the alignment of the criminal legal assistance scheme with the civil legal aid scheme. I believe that, as a principle, that has gained acceptance across the board. The fundamental, underlying principle is that the recipient of criminal legal assistance should make a contribution to his or her legal costs if they are able to do so.</p><p>As a member of the Welfare Reform Committee, I very much welcome the undertakings to disregard disability living allowance and to work with Capability Scotland on disability-related expenditure. I make a plea: Inclusion Scotland is very keen to be involved in that process, and I hope that there is a role for it. I also hope that war pensions will be disregarded.</p><p>In conclusion, the bill will bring forward much-needed changes to the justice system. It seems to be expected that some 82 per cent of cases will result in nil contributions, but it is important to ensure that, with the massive Westminster cuts to the Scottish budget that we face, the broad scope of the current legal aid scheme can be maintained.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675001", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I accept that that is a possibility, but I am not entirely sure whether that is the best way forward in the initial period to get the rules updated and out there.

How on earth would reintroducing a tax on the sick help our country to move forwards?

I cannot refer to the individuals in any detail because of issues concerning confidentiality, but for a detailed examination of all that is wrong with the current approach one need only read the Official Report of the Welfare Reform Committee&#8217;s meeting of Tuesday 18 September, which has already been referred to. Committee members heard the powerful testimonies of Mr Norman Gray about his son, Mrs Janice Scott about her husband and Mr Henry Sherlock about his own situation.</p><p>I respectfully suggest that that should be essential reading for all members of the Parliament, for it is quite clear that no account is taken of the individual situation. Indeed, it is claimed that, in many instances, the individual is not even listened to and medical orthodoxies are turned on their head. That that approach is fundamentally flawed is witnessed by the fact that some 40 per cent of ESA appeals are successful, which is an astonishingly high figure.</p><p>In a speech of four minutes, it is impossible to convey the truly abhorrent nature of what is going on, but what is clear to me is that this inhumane system simply cannot be allowed to continue, for it misses the fundamental issue as far as disabled people are concerned.

I, too, welcome the Polish consul to the public gallery. I have had the pleasure of meeting the consul on many occasions in Perth.</p><p>I congratulate my colleague Christine Grahame on securing this important debate and thank her for giving us the opportunity to highlight not just the considerable achievements of those who were behind the great Polish map of Scotland, but the wider and deeper connections between our countries that that wonderful endeavour represents. We have heard something of that already in the debate. The efforts to ensure that the map is restored and preserved, which have been described, are to be welcomed.</p><p>Before I turn to the deep connections between my home patch of Perthshire and Poland, I will briefly mention my personal links with Poland. I had the privilege of attending a summer school at the Jagiellonian University in Krak&#243;w in July and August of 1982, some months after martial law had been declared and after trade sanctions had been imposed. I was there as part of a student exchange programme that was, uniquely, allowed to go ahead in those particular circumstances. It was a formative experience and led to my participation, some months later in December of that year, with some pride, in a march in support of Solidarnosc, in Amsterdam where I was studying at the time. I was keen to participate in that march of solidarity, having had those personal experiences in Poland. I have maintained a deep affection for and interest in Poland since that time.</p><p>The same applies to Perthshire, whose connections with Poland run deep. For example, the links can be seen in the fact that Perth and Kinross Council has been twinned with the Polish city of Bydgoszcz for many years and, more poignantly, that a special section of Wellshill cemetery in Perth is set aside for Polish war graves from the second world war. Indeed, 381 members of the Polish forces lie at rest in Wellshill, which is about half of all the Polish war graves in Scotland. Many Polish forces were based in Perthshire and, after the war, a great many stayed on, marrying locally, bringing up families and becoming an important part of the local community. That is one reason why a quick perusal of the local telephone book in Perth shows that many people with Polish surnames live in the area.</p><p>As part of the year of homecoming in 2009, Horsecross Arts, a multi-award-winning arts organisation in Perth, staged &#8220;Scottish Tides-Polish Spring&#8221;, which was a three-month-long cultural feast celebrating centuries of close connections between Scotland and Poland. As we have heard, the relationship is a special one that began with the relocation of tens of thousands of Scots to Poland in the late 16th century and the creation of trade links with the Baltic.

That is a subject that is close to my heart since the contract work that I did for some years a while back for the Comrie Development Trust, which is a successful development trust that operates in the village that I am pleased to call my home. If an example of best practice in unlocking community potential was ever needed, I submit that Comrie, through not only the development trust but the community council&#8212;there are 50 different groups and bodies involved in the community&#8212;would be at the top of the tree. Underlying all those groups are determined, visionary and indefatigable individuals who have ideas and a wish to see their ideas come to fruition. Those individuals have made an enormous difference in a village with a population of fewer than 2,000 people.</p><p>I will mention two particular examples in the limited time available. First is the establishment of the Comrie junior strings, which happened within one year of the idea being mooted. A group of people saw that children were not getting access to tuition in stringed instruments. They therefore went out, raised money, and got donated violins and cellos, including from people&#8217;s attics. They then got together and we now see&#8212;with the lead of the indefatigable Jean Kidd, who is well known in music circles across Scotland&#8212;nine children at primary school age in Comrie learning the violin and the cello. That is an amazing example of what can be done locally if there is the individual determination and can-do spirit.</p><p>The other example is that, again, within one year of the idea being mooted among running enthusiasts in Comrie&#8212;I am afraid that I am not one of those, which might be evident from my physique&#8212;we saw the launch of a Comrie mountain marathon. That is a two day event that was first took place last October. It attracted thousands of participants to Comrie, to stay overnight and to enjoy the hospitality. Again, people were not simply satisfied with having the idea but wanted to ensure that it came to fruition.</p><p>We need to find a way to take best practice to bottle that can-do spirit that is present in communities across the length and breadth of Scotland. It is also about, as Sarah Boyack said, increasing capacity. We are fortunate in the village that I go home in that we have a number of people who have experience of different things that have helped with those processes.</p><p>On the issue of community buyout, I am pleased to see that the land reform review group has been set up and that it is to be tasked with looking at improving the process. I support the extension of community buyout to urban areas. That has been such a landmark success of this Scottish Parliament and, of course, the first buyout we saw was in Crossgates in Fife.</p><p>The consultation is an excellent example of action by a Government that is determined to make a difference to the lives of our citizens, that is listening to people and, with a final plea from me, emptying dangerous buildings. We must do something about that because it depresses communities throughout Scotland.

As has been mentioned, it is intended to help to ensure that every child in Scotland can achieve their full potential. That is an overarching objective of this SNP Government, and it reflects its ambition to make Scotland the best place in the world for a child to grow up in. It appears that the focus is being placed on the early years and preventative spend. It has been widely recognised by the Christie commission and in reports such as &#8220;Joining the Dots&#8221;, by the former Labour minister Susan Deacon, that preventative spend on the early years is pivotal in improving the lives of our citizens in the years to come and in getting the best value for the public purse.</p><p>As we have heard, the focus on early intervention and preventative spend is to be achieved by a number of provisions. A key element is the proposed increase in the amount of free nursery education from 475 hours to a minimum of 600 hours for three and four-year-olds, as well as for looked-after two-year-olds. That will build on the work that the SNP Government embarked upon when it increased free nursery provision by 20 per cent in the previous parliamentary session, which was widely welcomed, as it benefited some 100,000 children.</p><p>It is clear that by enshrining the new enhanced package of free nursery care in legislation, we will be able to deliver lasting change and provide some flexibility in how nursery care can be delivered. I am confident that the Scottish Government&#8217;s plans for the best free nursery package in the UK will be seen as a good thing by families across Scotland, even if this afternoon some Opposition members have displayed their usual negativity.</p><p>I also understand that the bill will include provisions to enhance children&#8217;s rights and will provide a clear statutory framework for the organisation and delivery of services that are provided to children and young people, including&#8212;of course&#8212;vulnerable children. In that respect, it is important to recognise the significant efforts and sterling hard work of all those who have been involved in provision of services to children over the years. As they will know, there have been many changes, and it will surely be helpful to them to have those changes codified on a consistent statutory basis, and to have the child&#8217;s interests put on a statutory footing at the very heart of the process.</p><p>I look forward to the debate on that bill and, indeed, on all the other bills as they come before Parliament.

Our committee was the lead committee on the bill in this parliamentary session, but I pay tribute to the Justice Committee in the previous session for its hard work. That committee secured significant progress on a similar bill but could not complete that work because of what could be regarded as an immutable deadline in this place&#8212;an election. I say well done to that committee.</p><p>As we have heard, the bill will complete a substantial piece of work by the Scottish Law Commission on the reform of Scots property law. The key element of that reform was the abolition of feudal tenure, which was a significant development in Scots property law. Like the minister, I pay tribute to the commission for its hard work. I, too, am pleased to hear that Lynda Clark will take on a new role, in which I wish her well.</p><p>The bill will facilitate the objective that was set forth&#8212;abolishing the feudal system&#8212;by converting to ownership instances of what could be termed de facto ownership, in which a tenant holds over land a registered long lease, as defined in the bill. That is akin to being the owner of the land, but the tenant is not the heritable proprietor, as we have heard.</p><p>Conversion will be automatic if the relevant thresholds are passed&#8212;they are defined as a rent of more than &#163;100 and, as we have heard, a lease duration of more than 175 years with 100 years or more left to run for residential long leases or with more than 175 years left to run for non-residential long leases. It is important to bear it in mind that a tenant may opt out of automatic conversion. Compensation will be payable to the landlord, although&#8212;in keeping with the terms of long leases&#8212;the compensation will not be a hugely significant sum.</p><p>Those are the bare bones of the bill. As we have heard, some amendments were made to it. As the minister said, they have served to improve the bill&#8217;s drafting. We have heard about the contentious part of the debate and in particular about the common good&#8212;that was discussed at stage 3 this morning. It is absolutely clear that, if we have an automatic trigger date for the entry into force of the key provision on automatic conversion and if we have a system in which the keeper is not on the face of it in a position to know whether land is common good, it cannot be in the public interest that legal uncertainty could be created by asking who the owner is, if that is not the tenant who would become the heritable proprietor on automatic conversion.</p><p>As a conveyancing lawyer in a previous life, I understand absolutely the mechanics of how the system would work in practice, and I know that the proposal in the stage 3 amendment would not have worked in practice. I am pleased that the Labour group changed to a much more sensible position and listened to the debate, and I am also pleased that the Parliament rejected the unworkable amendment that was lodged.</p><p>I am pleased to support the bill, which represents a significant further step in reforming Scots property law.

As the cabinet secretary said, we are now coming to the crunch negotiations on the CFP review. We could send an important signal from our Parliament today to support the Scottish Government as it strives to stand up for our fishermen, our fishing communities and our fishing industry.</p><p>As we have heard, there are many issues of significance for the Scottish fleet and, as Graeme Dey outlined, for the processing industry. One of the key issues is how we get from what has been a totally discredited management policy to a policy that has a chance of delivering the conservation objectives that we all&#8212;including our fishermen&#8212;wish to see, and which can operate without further decimating our fishing industry and fishing communities.</p><p>My colleague Dave Thompson mentioned Lossie. I remember, as a young teenager, being able to walk from one side of the harbour to the other on fishing boats; now, as he said, it is simply a marina. That is what has happened under the CFP and under successive London Governments that have misrepresented us in Brussels.</p><p>The solution that is proposed for the central core of the CFP involves a move towards regionalisation of its management. That would allow member states to work together in respect of specific sea basin areas to take decisions that are fit for purpose and make sense for the area, while complying with the overarching objectives that are set by the EU. Any failure to proceed with meaningful regionalisation would, as many members have said, be a huge missed opportunity. It is clear to all that the micromanagement that has taken place so far has simply not worked.</p><p>One of the several difficulties that have been cited in moving towards meaningful regionalisation concerns issues to do with the legal basis under EU law. I understand that work has gone on in the background with regard to that issue and, as a former EU law practitioner, I cannot see that it is beyond the wit of the legal services of the various EU institutions to find a way around that while complying with EU law. However, in the labyrinthine and byzantine world of the EU, it might be thought&#8212;by some at least&#8212;that the Commission is protesting a wee bit too much and overemphasising the legal difficulties on the basis that it fundamentally does not want to relinquish too much control. Of course, I could not possibly comment on that. Be that as it may, I believe that the political impetus for meaningful regionalisation appears to be in place, and that must be delivered.</p><p>Another key area that has been mentioned is the issue of discards, which are as abhorrent to fishermen as they are to everybody else, for they represent an inexcusable waste of a precious food resource when we know that people in the world are starving. The discards issue also shows clearly that the current management system is simply not working.</p><p>We should be proud of our fleet in Scotland, because we have led the way on finding solutions and our discard reduction initiatives have led to the greatest reductions in cod discards by any country in the EU. We therefore need a realistic programme at the EU level that recognises actions that have already been taken, such as pioneering the use of new and selective types of fishing gear, real-time area closures and the successful but sadly limited catch quota scheme that we are able to promote at this point.</p><p>In the time that I have left I will focus on one red-line issue, which is the principle of relative stability. We have heard that there is a potential threat to relative stability in the transferable fishing concessions provision. Relative stability is the bulwark against a free-for-all in Scottish waters, and the recognition of that principle was fought for very hard indeed down through the years by people such as my mother, Winnie Ewing, when she was the member of the European Parliament for the Highlands and Islands for some 24 years. The threat this time round comes from the TFCs&#8212;or, in plain language, transferable quotas.</p><p>I was pleased to hear the cabinet secretary say that there had been positive movement in that regard, and I hope that he will provide further detail when he winds up the debate because, although it might be said that the approach will be voluntary, it is crucial that we are able to ensure that that is the case.</p><p>It is clear that our fleet in Scotland would not be in the difficult situation that it faces if Scotland were already independent, because we would have always fought for our fleet, in the way that the Spanish have always fought for theirs. The Spanish put fishing at the top of their agenda; fishing was nowhere near the top of the UK Government&#8217;s agenda. From the start, as Edward Heath said, our fishing industry has been regarded as expendable. It has been sold down the river by countless Westminster Governments, whatever their political hue. We need to ensure that we can speak up for our fishing industry, in accordance with our industry&#8217;s priorities, and that we can put our vital fishing interests at the top of the agenda. The only way that we can ensure that that happens is by reclaiming the powers of a normal independent country.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668727", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in this important debate on reform of the CFP.

As the deputy convener of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, I am pleased to have been involved, along with my fellow committee members, in scrutinising and debating the bill as it has gone through the legislative process.</p><p>The bill sets forth just three short provisions. However, as members have said, those provisions are important not just in themselves but because they are a signal that all the key players in the sector are prepared to work together via the tenant farming forum and in partnership with the Scottish Government, which is a point that was well made by my committee colleague Alex Fergusson. It is a tribute to the work of the tenant farming forum in particular that we have reached this point. The work of the forum has focused on making progress on a number of issues that are addressed in the bill and will facilitate a greater degree of legislative protection for tenant farmers. We will therefore, it is hoped, have a more vibrant tenant farming sector as a result.</p><p>The bill extends the definition of &#8220;near relative&#8221; to include grandchildren of the tenant. In practice, that will mean that there is a wider group of people who will enjoy some protection at least on the death of the tenant with regard to the succession to the tenancy. It is hoped that that will assist new&#8212;and perhaps younger&#8212;entrants to get a start in the tenant farming sector.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary mentioned, the Scottish Government lodged an amendment that responded to the committee&#8217;s concerns such that the provision will have an impact, notwithstanding the fact that the tenant may have died before the bill comes into effect, in circumstances in which the relevant counter-notice has not been served until after the bill comes into force. I listened carefully to what Alex Fergusson said about retrospection, as I did in the committee at stage 2. I do not think that there is a case of retrospection. That view is shared not just by the cabinet secretary but by Scott Walker, the chief executive of NFUS&#8212;I hope that that is of assistance to Alex Fergusson.</p><p>Another key element in the bill is the clarification that it provides, further to recent case law, that a variation in VAT will not in itself be deemed to be a variation in rent. That is important, because there could have been a negative impact on the three-yearly rent review cycle. The amendment was sought by the industry and delivered in the bill.</p><p>The specific issues that are dealt with in the bill are of great importance and merit our legislative attention but, as members said, during the process it has very much been the case that the elephant has been outside the room, because a parallel debate is going on about a series of significant issues that require to be looked at and resolved. Many such issues were raised in the evidence that the committee took, and it is important that they will be the subject of further deliberation.</p><p>I particularly welcome the rent review special ad hoc working group that is to be set up. I commend the efforts of everyone who has been involved in getting to this stage, because the issue is a thorny one, which arises in particular but not exclusively from the difficulties in relation to the recent Moonzie judgment. I also welcome the fact that a series of issues will be considered, many of which have been mentioned in the debate.</p><p>We also need to consider dispute resolution. Scotland has set up an excellent arbitration system, which could provide invaluable assistance in the area by negating the need to go to the Scottish Land Court, which is expensive and extremely time consuming.</p><p>The bill will do much to improve the position of tenants, while respecting landlords&#8217; rights.

What is unsupportable is the taking away of the safety net from some of the most vulnerable members of society. That is not in keeping with the basic tenets of a civilised society but, regrettably, that is what the UK Welfare Reform Act 2012 does.</p><p>I, too, am pleased to sit on the Welfare Reform Committee. As has been said, we owe gratitude to all the third sector organisations that took the time and effort to contribute, and to all the individuals who took the time and trouble to contact us via our special website mechanism, which was set up to facilitate such contact. Some of the case histories that we received illustrate well the intrinsic problems with the benefits system and the poor way in which it is implemented at present&#8212;let alone what we are about to see in the years to come. I also thank the clerks, who worked very hard indeed to keep up with the sheer volume of information that we received.</p><p>The bill is an enabling bill, and the reasons for introducing it have been set out clearly in the debate. The Scottish Parliament took a historic vote on 22 December last year to partially refuse to grant legislative consent. We, of course, need the legislation in order to ensure that we in Scotland can act on matters that are consequent on the introduction of universal credit and the personal independence payment.</p><p>The bill is therefore enabling legislation and should be seen in that context. It has six sections, whose purpose is to ensure that we can take the necessary steps with respect to passported benefits, such that they will remain in place for April 2013, which is the start date of the new UK headline benefits. That is to be secured by way of subsequent subordinate legislation. There has been much debate about process issues this afternoon and in the committee, and I have listened carefully to that debate. However, as I have said repeatedly in committee, the moral imperative is that measures be put in place for April 2013 in respect of passported benefits, and that there is no gap in provision of what is, in effect, a lifeline benefit for so many people in our society. That is the overarching objective that we should all, as parliamentarians, have.</p><p>It has been stated that we have no control over the legislative timetable, which is dictated by Westminster. In an ideal world, we could spend the next years considering specific details of what is to follow, but we do not live in an ideal world; we are nearly at the end of May and, as the cabinet secretary said earlier, we are still waiting for key information from the UK Government about the headline benefits.</p><p>So&#8212;this is where we are and this is the job that we have to do.

This afternoon, the cabinet secretary issued an open invitation to all interested bodies and others to submit their ideas on what they wish to see. We cannot have any greater guidance that that is the clear direction of travel that the cabinet secretary wishes to take on the matter.</p><p>In the committee, we have gone further than simply looking at the enabling provisions; we have called on the Scottish Government to proceed as far as possible with further mitigation. Of course, the caveat is that we can act only within the powers of the Scotland Act 1998 and within the fixed budget that is available to us. An interesting feature of the process has been the call for further mitigation by a number of the organisations that gave evidence.</p><p>That raises the crucial issue of where the power over welfare reform should lie as, far as the people of Scotland are concerned. An increasing number of voices in Scotland are being raised, publicly disputing the UK Government&#8217;s approach to welfare reform&#8212;they seek for Scotland something better and something improved. At the same time, there are calls for the Scottish Government to undo the harm that will flow from the Westminster policies&#8212;notwithstanding the fact that the powers and the resourcing of the welfare system still lie with the UK Government. My response to that apparent dilemma is to have a social protection system that fits our society&#8217;s values and objectives. However, to do that we need the power to set and resource our own policy. In short, we need the normal powers of a normal independent country.

I fully support that campaign and I hope that we can see some progress on that in the months to come.</p><p>I pay tribute to the National Deaf Children&#8217;s Society and to Action on Hearing Loss Scotland. Both organisations do a tremendous amount of work and we have received very helpful briefings from them on the debate.</p><p>There are around 3,500 deaf children in Scotland, about 83 per cent of whom are educated in mainstream schools. Of course, being deaf is rightly not regarded, in and of itself, as amounting to a learning disability. It is therefore important that, when it is appropriate, deaf children are educated in the mainstream system. Nevertheless, the statistics give us cause for some concern, because they show that there is an attainment gap between deaf children and their hearing counterparts. That tells us that more perhaps needs to be done to provide more targeted assistance for pupils who are deaf or who have learning difficulties.</p><p>I understand that, since 2007, a local record of deaf children pilot project in NHS Tayside and NHS Lothian has enabled healthcare professionals to record a range of information about all deaf children. That information will be extremely useful in assisting local health, education and social care teams to plan their workforce and resources to meet needs and to improve the service that is provided to deaf and hearing-impaired children. The more detailed knowledge we have, the better we can respond to the needs of society.</p><p>I am confident that we in the chamber are conscious of the huge impact&#8212;it has been alluded to by all the members who have spoken&#8212;that a loss of hearing would have on our lives. We must remember that as we seek to formulate policies, so that we ensure that we do our best to get the policy right.</p><p>Acoustics in school buildings, in particular, have been mentioned. As Dennis Robertson said, the importance of acoustics should be taken into account in all places of learning. I am not conversant with all the details of that debate, but I support the principle that we have to ensure that every child has the same chance&#8212;and it is the best that we can make it&#8212;in their learning environment.

It is enjoyable to repeat this diverse list. We have Scottish Ballet, Scottish Opera, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and, last but by no means least, the National Theatre of Scotland. Each of those five companies is a centre of excellence and I pay tribute at the outset to the dedication and commitment of all those involved. I also pay tribute to all those involved in the national youth companies. I should perhaps declare an interest because my niece, Ciara Ewing, and my nephew, Jamie Ewing, are both members of the national youth choir. They are enjoying their experience enormously.</p><p>I also have to confess, like the other Annabel in the chamber&#8212;we have been the subject of mistaken identity today and I hope that the other Annabel will not be too horrified by that state of affairs&#8212;my ballet days are well and truly behind me. However, until fairly recently, I used to list under the heading &#8220;Hobbies and interests&#8221; in a curriculum vitae, &#8220;Going to the theatre.&#8221; I have had to drop that one, though, to reflect factual accuracy, because I do not seem to get to the theatre very much these days and certainly not as much as I would like, due to other calls on my time. However, I hope to rectify that in the years to come.</p><p>Unusually, I was at a local play a couple of weeks ago. It would be remiss of me not to mention that it was called &#8220;Off the Hook&#8221;, and the production was put on by the Crieff drama group. It played to full houses over three nights and was very much enjoyed by all who attended it. Having mentioned the Crieff drama group, it would be remiss of me and perhaps somewhat risky for me not to mention the Comrie drama group. Comrie is, of course, the fantastic village that I am very pleased to call home. Comrie drama group puts on successful plays throughout the year, together with an excellent panto every Christmas. Like Crieff drama group, Comrie drama group always plays to full houses. As in Crieff, many people in Comrie are involved in one way or another in productions, and they are to be commended for their commitment.</p><p>I mention those local examples to highlight the appetite across Scotland for theatre and other performing arts and to flag up the importance of the national touring that the national companies undertake, which is a key feature of their role in our country&#8217;s cultural life. I ask the cabinet secretary to ensure that the locations that the fantastic national tours cover are constantly reviewed, to ensure that none of Scotland&#8217;s communities&#8212;however large, medium-sized, small or dispersed it is&#8212;is left out of the fantastic programmes. I assure her that there is an audience out there for such visits and I am sure that such audiences would be enthusiastic.</p><p>In addition to national touring, the national companies do extensive international touring. I was pleased to hear the cabinet secretary confirm the &#163;350,000 for the international touring fund. International touring is not just important to the national economy; it is also about showcasing on the world stage Scotland&#8217;s cultural excellence and diversity and the modern and innovative productions for which our national companies are famed. In touring, our national companies act in effect as cultural ambassadors, and they do Scotland proud. We shall see further evidence of that in this year of creative Scotland, when our national companies will play a significant role in attracting international tourism and investment to Scotland. I am sure that the whole Parliament wishes them well in that endeavour.</p><p>The national companies&#8217; work has many international aspects in addition to international touring. We have heard about the excellent success of the National Theatre&#8217;s production of &#8220;Black Watch&#8221;. Having seen it, I agree that it is fantastic. I think that it is the best play that I have seen, save perhaps the 7:84 Theatre Company&#8217;s &#8220;The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil&#8221;, which I hope will make a comeback fairly soon.</p><p>We see internationalism in the work of all our national companies. Guest conductors are invited to perform with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the RSNO and artistic exchange partnerships take place&#8212;between the National Theatre and China, for example. We heard about the National Theatre&#8217;s work in Chicago and its great work in Brooklyn with the extreme ceilidh, to which the cabinet secretary referred. Malcolm Chisholm referred to the five-minute theatre project, which rightly excited the well-known arts commentator Joyce McMillan.</p><p>The cultural scene in Scotland is innovative and vibrant. The internationalism of our national companies is to be as treasured as the work that they do in Scotland is. The national companies contribute enormously to feeding the soul, as well as the national economy, and they are key players on the world stage. We should all be enormously proud of them. I sincerely believe that, as Scotland continues its journey to independence, we shall see increased global interest not only in our political endeavours but in our exciting cultural scene.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666257", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Performing Companies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am very pleased to have been called to speak in this debate on Scotland&#8217;s national performing companies and, indeed, to follow on from the very considerate contribution that Claudia Beamish made to the debate.

It is important to point that out before I opine on how nice it is to deal with amendments to Scots law in the Scottish Parliament, rather than dealing with poorly drafted amendments that are treated as an afterthought at the 11th hour and rarely given time to be debated, which was the practice in the House of Commons, certainly when I was a member in that place.</p><p>As we have heard, the bill emanates from the considerable work of the Scottish Law Commission and was designed to complete the process of the abolition of feudal tenure in Scotland, thereby simplifying property law and&#8212;importantly&#8212;bringing it into the 21st century. We have heard that the bill will enhance the position of tenants, as long leases&#8212;we have heard about how they are to be defined&#8212;will be converted to ownership, so the tenant will gain a clear benefit. Such conversion will be automatic unless the tenant chooses to opt out. The bill will facilitate the tenant becoming the owner of the property: that is in effect the de facto position at present for the leases that will fall within the scope of the bill, which will give that position legal recognition.</p><p>At the same time, compensation and additional payments will be paid to the landlord, who will have an entitlement, which is important to point out. We have heard about the exemptions that have been set out, including the threshold of &#163;100 for annual rental; the pipes and cables exemption, which is important; and Peterhead harbour, which&#8212;as the committee accepted&#8212;is in a unique position.</p><p>None of those exemptions was controversial but, as we have heard from several members, two issues arose during our consideration of the bill&#8212;one with respect to the common good and one with respect to the Waverley market. In relation to the common good, it became clear during the committee&#8217;s scrutiny that there was a significant lack of clarity on what common good land would be covered by the bill and even on what common good land was held by the 32 local authorities in Scotland. It also became clear that there was no easy solution to that lack of clarity. As the minister has explained, the difficulties of compiling a register in a timely and non-resource-intensive manner are not insignificant. That is a work in progress that we must look to in the future.</p><p>The status of the Waverley market was the subject of considerable debate. The committee was not hugely impressed with the evidence that was provided on the issue. Indeed, we were disappointed in the quality of the case that was purportedly put forward by the proponents of an exemption. However, I am pleased to hear from the minister that the issue is being considered further and that pre-existing legislation relating to the Waverley market that the bill may have an adverse impact on is being examined.

Currently, although the tenant can assign the tenancy to a wider group of people, upon the tenant&#8217;s death it is only &#8220;near relatives&#8221; who will be afforded protection as successor tenants, in that they can serve a counter notice following a notice to quit being served by the landlord. As we have heard, the phrase &#8220;near relative&#8221; is narrowly defined and does not currently include grandchildren of the tenant, but the bill proposes to extend that protection to grandchildren of the tenant. In doing so, it acknowledges the consensus that was reached in the tenant farming forum, which is the industry body that was set up inter alia to consider improvements in the operation of agricultural tenancy law and practice.</p><p>As I said in my intervention on Mr Lamont, others also spoke in favour of there being a wider definition when they gave evidence to the committee, including the Scottish Tenant Farmers Association and the National Farmers Union Scotland. Although the committee had sympathy with those who support a wider definition, it felt nonetheless that, in accordance with the very delicate compromise that was achieved by the TFF, we should forge ahead with the approach as it stands.</p><p>It is a matter of some disappointment to me that matters cannot progress more quickly, but taking into account the hard work that has been done to get us where we are, on balance it is more important to respect the consensus and hope that it spurs people in the TFF on to more speedy work and the creation of more consensus on the broader issues that have been alluded to.</p><p>We have also heard about the important issue of lack of data. In order to inform our debate on the way forward, we must secure accurate and meaningful data. Otherwise, we will have a debate that is based on assertions and speculative figures, which would be no help to anybody.</p><p>On a conciliatory note, I believe that Scottish Land &amp; Estates is to be commended for its change of heart during the committee process&#8212;which the cabinet secretary mentioned&#8212;on when the extended succession provisions should apply. The matter is not expected to affect too many people in practice but, nonetheless, Scottish Land &amp; Estates showed willingness to compromise on the issue, so it should be given the credit that it is due. I hope that that signals a willingness to engage on the wider issues in the same spirit of consensus, because it is the wider issues to which we now need to turn.</p><p>I commend all the committee members for their hard work in producing a consensual report.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664295", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although I have the privilege of being the deputy convener of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, I speak not on behalf of the committee but as an individual MSP.

I, too, put on record my extreme disappointment with the UK minister&#8217;s announcement earlier this month. My heart goes out to the Remploy employees in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Motherwell. I say for the record, and for the benefit of people in the public gallery, that&#8212;like all my SNP colleagues&#8212;I would have been happy to come to support this morning&#8217;s demonstration if I had been aware of it.</p><p>As the SNP MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, I obviously have very serious concerns about the future of the Remploy factories in Cowdenbeath, Leven and Stirling. Although those sites have been spared the axe wielded by the UK Tory-Liberal Government on 7 March, of which we have heard much during the debate, the deeply worrying lack of clarity about their future and that of the factories in Clydebank and Dundee is regrettable.</p><p>That lack of clarity results from the fact that the sites have been labelled &#8220;potentially viable&#8221; by the UK DWP, which is not particularly helpful, to say the least; it is certainly not helpful for the 95 staff currently employed at those sites, who deserve so much better.</p><p>Perhaps we should not be too surprised to see such cavalier treatment being afforded by the UK Tory-Liberal Government to disabled people when we bear in mind the savage cuts to disability benefits of 20 per cent across the board&#8212;cuts that were a key driver of the Tory-Liberal Welfare Reform Act 2012, which was passed in London the other week. The UK Government made no bones about the fact that the cuts were the objective of its legislation.</p><p>Indeed, the latest attack on supported employment must be seen against the backdrop of the UK welfare legislation. It is hard to imagine a more callous act at this time. As the First Minister said during First Minister&#8217;s question time on 8 March:</p><p>&#8220;There are plenty of abuses of power by Westminster over Scotland ... for example, I regard the Remploy employees as suffering from such an abuse of power, I regard the cuts to the disability living allowance in Scotland as a huge abuse of power&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 8 March 2012; c 7063.]</p><p>The question is, where do we go from here? It is key that we understand the importance of the role of supported businesses and supported employment for some disabled people and the contribution that those make to securing a person-centred approach to promoting opportunity for disabled people in the workplace.</p><p>As we have heard, that is the case in relation to both access to work and, importantly, access to training, as mentioned by Mr Livingstone&#8212;I mean Mr Macintosh. I am at it again&#8212;there must be something about Mr Macintosh that leads to that slight confusion of identity.</p><p>I am not saying that mainstreaming of employment should not also be pursued. It must always be a question of what suits the individual. There can never be a one-size-fits-all approach, because we are dealing with individual human beings who have varying needs. As the minister said, the Scottish Government recognises that.</p><p>I was pleased to hear that a commission will shortly be established to undertake a review of supported businesses. I note the minister&#8217;s assurances to Helen Eadie that the review will not kick the issue into the long grass and that it will run in parallel with our efforts to do what we can to help those who are in need of our assistance.</p><p>I believe that that approach is the correct way forward. In contrast, the UK Tory-Liberal Government in London is taking a draconian approach and seems intent on trying to undermine the dignity of disabled people, many of whom are beginning to feel as if they are under siege by that Government. Nothing that the Tory front-bench spokeswoman said would change the view of many disabled people in that regard or provide any reassurance whatsoever.</p><p>Notwithstanding the UK Government&#8217;s position, in Scotland we must strive to demonstrate that there is a future for the remaining Remploy sites and, in so doing, we must focus first and foremost on the workers and the contribution that they make. Any extraneous operational costs should be identified and must be dealt with. As Helen Eadie alluded to, workers have concerns about those costs. They have contacted me about their concerns, too, and I am sure that, in the light of the hard work that she has carried out over the years to further the interests of Remploy workers, she is in receipt of the same information about bonuses, overtime and so on.</p><p>The focus has to be on the workers and their important contribution, and on how we can increase sustainability. I hope that all parties will support the calls on the DWP to release to the Scottish Government all relevant information that could assist in that process. It is worth stressing that, as has been mentioned, the Glencraft example shows what can be done when the private sector, local government and central Government are involved and when we have the drive, the determination and the imagination to secure alternative investment streams and to make a go of things.</p><p>We have a task ahead of us, but I am delighted to hear that the Scottish Government will strain every sinew to ensure that Remploy workers in Scotland have a future. I hope that we will attract cross-party support for that, because those workers deserve nothing less.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664124", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Remploy (United Kingdom Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in this important debate.

I will take up Patrick Harvie&#8217;s point by saying, without being self-congratulatory, that it is important to understand our achievements to date. The Malawi renewable energy acceleration programme has been mentioned. That programme has been led by the University of Strathclyde in our great city of Glasgow. We have also contributed to the publication of a report to help the Maldives, where people face potentially catastrophic difficulties with climate change. The report was produced by Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. Jamie McGrigor mentioned the wonderful University of Oxford; many Scottish universities are also contributing to the debate.</p><p>The Scottish Government clearly recognises Scotland&#8217;s international responsibilities to help to secure climate justice for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet. That is entirely in keeping with Scotland&#8217;s sense of the common weal. The establishment of a climate justice fund is a natural extension of that intrinsic Scottish characteristic.</p><p>I believe that today&#8217;s debate will make a significant contribution.

From the speeches thus far and from my general knowledge of goings-on in the Parliament, I know that there is support for the debate right across the chamber and that, since the Parliament was reconvened in 1999, the tenets that inspire the debate have had many champions from all parties. I, too, congratulate my colleague Stewart Maxwell on securing the debate. I commend him for his hard work over the years in seeking to ensure that lessons are learned and that we meet the challenge of tackling anti-Semitism, racism, bigotry and sectarianism wherever they occur.</p><p>On the 67th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, some might ask what the purpose of the debate is. I would say that we are here to commemorate&#8212;which is to say, to bear witness to&#8212;the 6&#160;million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis and to educate so that we are on constant watch to ensure that such atrocities and mass state-sanctioned murder never happen again.</p><p>I, too, have visited Auschwitz-Birkenau, in the summer of 1982, when I was a young postgraduate student studying at Johns Hopkins University&#8217;s Bologna centre, which had an exchange programme with the Jagiellonian University in Krak&#243;w. As part of our visit there, we had the opportunity to go to Auschwitz. I remember my visit as if it were yesterday. Like my colleague Stuart McMillan, I remember coming to the gates of what had been a labour camp at Auschwitz, which beckoned people with the words &#8220;Arbeit macht frei&#8221;. I remember the smiling faces of the young twins in photographs that covered an entire wall and which were taken before the grotesque experiments of the butcher Josef Mengele. I remember the shoes and the industrial-scale ovens in Birkenau. I remember the train tracks that came right into the death camp. I ask myself how it could be that ordinary people&#8212;people like you and me, Presiding Officer&#8212;could be in Paris or Amsterdam one day and then be taken like cattle on trains from the centre of those grand European cities to end up in Auschwitz-Birkenau. I ask myself how it could be that Europe descended into such obscenity.</p><p>On the day of my visit, some of the international students pulled out of the trip, saying that they could not go because they would find it too distressing. I could neither understand nor agree with that view, because I felt&#8212;as I still feel strongly&#8212;that it was my duty and the collective duty of all of us who have lived and enjoyed basic human rights to visit the death camp and to bear witness to man&#8217;s inhumanity to his fellow man. My experience of visiting Auschwitz-Birkenau has stayed with me and has informed my views and inspired me to fight for human rights and dignity and for the freedom of the individual.</p><p>I, too, commend the work of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, particularly its focus on education. As we have heard, the Holocaust is taught widely in Scottish schools, and post-16-year-olds have the opportunity to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. I am sure that their visits will leave an indelible mark on their lives.

However, I am an alumnus of the University of Glasgow and I recall the days when Simple Minds used to play at the Queen Margaret union. I guess that that shows my age a bit, so I will move swiftly back to the topic of the debate.</p><p>As we have heard, &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221; is the only Scottish opt-out on BBC Radio 1. It is Glasgow based and has been on air for about 11 years. It is currently ably presented by Ally McCrae and was previously ably presented by Vic Galloway. It is important to mention the current and past presenters because they know, and are known by, the Scottish music scene. They are well respected, taken seriously and, as Joan McAlpine said, physically accessible. That is of particular significance, as the purpose of the radio show is to showcase the nascent musical talent in Scotland&#8212;in particular, to showcase those who are not signed up to a music business contract.</p><p>The programme is pivotal in giving new, young artists the chance to experience some airplay and live sessions in the studio. At the same time, it gives that new, home-grown talent exposure to the public. Over the past 10 years or so, it has played a significant role in bringing on new acts in Scotland. We have heard the views of many of those acts that are now household names here and further afield. It also feeds the music industry, supports jobs and gives pleasure to thousands of the listening public.</p><p>Therefore, we must query why on earth the BBC is planning to scrap that successful format. Paradoxically, we hear that the plan is part of the delivering quality first restructuring programme. That is a bit of a misnomer. The BBC is surely scoring an own goal, as scrapping the programme would be the opposite of delivering quality first. It would be relegating quality to the bottom of the ladder and promoting bean counting and penny-pinching to the top of the agenda.</p><p>It is penny-pinching, as I understand that the fairly minimal cost savings to the BBC of scrapping the programme would be far outweighed by the potential costs to the music scene in Scotland. That is not to mention the small matter of the &#163;300 million that the BBC receives from licence payers in Scotland.</p><p>I fail to see how the decision is well judged. It does not fit with the BBC&#8217;s public service broadcasting obligation or its obligation to showcase and support culture not only in the city of London&#8212;as great as it is&#8212;but elsewhere in the UK. It is simply unimaginable that an independent public service broadcasting organisation in an independent Scotland would ever contemplate abandoning our nascent musical talent in the way that the BBC in London seems intent on doing.</p><p>I, too, urge the BBC to think again.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659334", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I hope that that does not cause too much confusion for the hordes of people who are listening to the debate.

It is clear that members on all sides recognise the importance to Scotland of the agriculture sector. Those who have spoken have put forward various suggestions and ideas as to how the CAP reforms should pan out. As a result, the debate will help the committee with its on-going scrutiny of the CAP reform proposals.</p><p>Mary Scanlon pointed out that, as with the Education and Culture Committee debate last week on the educational attainment of looked-after children, there is as yet no committee report. This anticipative-style committee debate, which I understand is being piloted to ensure that all members can inform the proceedings of committees on important matters, is a good process. It is particularly apposite as the CAP negotiations are at an early stage and will be on-going throughout the course of this year.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee will keep a close watching brief on the development of the proposals throughout the year. It may be&#8212;I am looking at the convener here&#8212;that a further committee debate in the chamber will be appropriate when negotiating positions on the detail are being firmed up.</p><p>The committee has already taken evidence from some of our MEPs and key stakeholders. We have an evidence session planned with the UK farming minister, Jim Paice, on 7 March, to be followed by an evidence session with the cabinet secretary on 14 March. The committee will then agree a position paper that is to be forwarded to the key players. At EU level, the draft European Parliament reports on CAP reform that are being drawn up are anticipated around April, and the committee will decide what further action needs to be taken at that time.</p><p>By now, the committee hoped to have heard directly from the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Caroline Spelman MP, as part of its initial evidence gathering. Regrettably, notwithstanding the committee having offered videoconferencing, the UK secretary of state had no date to offer the committee. However, I understand that further to her visit to a Scottish farm on 12 January&#8212;her first visit to a Scottish farm since taking office some 20 months ago&#8212;she made a courtesy call at the Scottish Parliament and the committee convener managed to secure a commitment from her that she will come before the committee at a later stage of the CAP negotiations. I am sure that the committee members will be pleased to hear that.</p><p>I turn to the substance of this afternoon&#8217;s excellent debate. I emphasise the key points about the context of the CAP reforms that are being proposed. Of course, the overarching issue is what the overall CAP budget will be. In effect, the Commission&#8217;s proposals preserve the current budget, with the concomitant greening proposals that we have heard about. Of course, it is too early to say what the final budget will be, given in particular the difficult economic circumstances in both the euro zone and other member states. That was a concern raised by a number of members, including Alex Fergusson, David Stewart and Elaine Murray.</p><p>In the context of the final agreed budget, whatever that may be, it will be vital for Scotland to ensure that we move from the current abysmal position of fourth lowest recipient of pillar 1 funding in the entire EU and lowest recipient of pillar 2 funding in the entire EU. I was pleased to hear members from across the chamber support not only a fair deal on pillar 2 funding but, importantly for our farmers, a fair deal on pillar 1 funding.</p><p>Some members, including the committee convener and colleagues such as Aileen McLeod, Jean Urquhart, Mike MacKenzie and Paul Wheelhouse, said that if Scotland were independent and had her own voice as a sovereign member state of the EU, she would not secure such a pitiful result in negotiations. Indeed, Scotland, as Scotland, would be able to put her own priorities first and not see them inevitably diluted as a result of the fact that the UK Government currently has the voice in Brussels. In the negotiations on the convergence proposals that are under way, if Scotland were already at the top table in her own right, we would see a net gain of hundreds of millions of pounds, as the figures have shown that we fall far below the European average in terms of current funding.</p><p>I recognise that not all members of the committee would, at least at this juncture, support Scotland&#8217;s having her own seat at the top table in the Council of Ministers, although of course views can change. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise where we stand in terms of agricultural support and where we hope to go. At the same time, it is important to note that while the UK secretary of state has been reported as stating that she understands the distinctive Scottish needs in the CAP debate, the UK Government has none the less made it clear that it wants the CAP budget to be slashed, with a move away from pillar 1 funding. Indeed, the debate in Westminster seems to be driven principally by the UK Treasury, not by DEFRA. I listened carefully to Alex Fergusson&#8217;s point about joint negotiations, but unless the UK position changes in favour of the Scottish position, then that, to me, is not joint negotiation.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658824", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy (Reform)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to wind up the debate in my capacity as the deputy convener of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee.

As the cabinet secretary made clear, the SNP Scottish Government welcomes welfare reform that leads to simplification, but only simplification through which work is made to pay and people are lifted out of poverty. The Scottish Government does not&#8212;and the Parliament should not&#8212;support simplification that is achieved by cutting support for vulnerable people while placing many additional pressures on devolved services, which we have heard about from several members.</p><p>Consequently, the Parliament must reflect carefully on the impact of the UK Welfare Reform Bill in Scotland, starting from the premise that a civilised society must have a safety net for its most vulnerable members. It is clear to anybody who has taken time to consider the UK proposals as drafted thus far that there is no safety net. The conclusion must be that we should accept the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposal that the detailed provisions that govern the universal credit and the personal independence payment should be made in Scotland by Scottish Parliament primary legislation and not by the Westminster Parliament.</p><p>We have heard that an ad hoc welfare committee is to be set up, which is a welcome development. It will exist for the duration of the current parliamentary session so that provisions can be properly examined and developed in our Parliament. By proceeding in that way, the SNP Scottish Government is sending a clear signal that the important thing is to get the legislation right for the people of Scotland, to ensure that the particular circumstances in our country are duly taken into account and, importantly, to provide assurance to the most vulnerable members of society that they will not be marginalised.</p><p>As we have heard, this is the first time in the lifetime of the Parliament that it has been proposed to withhold legislative consent to a UK bill. The fact that the move has been proposed by the SNP Government reflects the recognition of the damage that the UK bill would do to Scotland, including damage to the principles of fairness that underpin our society. Support for the SNP Government&#8217;s approach has come from various organisations, including Children in Scotland, Inclusion Scotland, Capability Scotland and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. The fact that the Government has garnered support across the board reflects the significant concerns about the bill throughout civic Scotland.</p><p>At the same time, the Scottish Government and Parliament should continue to urge the Tory-Liberal coalition in London to listen to the concerns that have been raised and to reconsider the approach in its welfare reform agenda. I fully support the Scottish Government&#8217;s efforts in that respect, because it is clear that, for people with a disability, the proposals are a draconian cuts agenda. The Tory-Liberal coalition seems to make no bones about it and seems proud of its target to cut the current disability living allowance by 20 per cent. The proposals are all about cuts and nothing to do with fairness or improving the operation of the system.</p><p>As I said in last evening&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate on disability history month, which was secured by Siobhan McMahon,</p><p>&#8220;in a civilised society, the payment of a benefit to assist with a disability should be seen as an entitlement and not a handout&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 21 December 2011; c 4928.]</p><p>The UK bill, through the introduction of the personal independence payment, will result in spurious assessment tests being imposed. Bob Doris carefully went through the facts of the current situation and provided a devastating critique of the work capability assessment, which I must point out was introduced by the previous Labour Government in Westminster. Spurious assessment tests will be imposed, even where there has been, or could be, no change in the circumstances of the individual concerned.</p><p>Furthermore, when it comes to the carrying out of those tests, in many instances, the services of the general practitioner or the specialist of the person concerned will be dispensed with. The fact that the Tory-Liberal coalition in London seems to be deeply suspicious of those professionals sits ill with the remarkable service that they provide for our NHS day in, day out. The Tory-Liberal London Government has a naked and unabashed determination to strip disabled people of the help to which they are entitled. What an indictment of that Government and how shameful it is that we have to be associated with such an uncivilised approach. The London Government most certainly does not speak for our society or our values.</p><p>I congratulate the SNP Government on the bold move that it has suggested that we take, which signals to Scotland as a whole that we will not sit by and watch the Tory-Liberal Government in London dismantling the very principles that underpin our society. Of course, it is right to say that, with the powers that would come with independence, we in this country would have the power to set our own welfare agenda without any interference at all from the London Government.

I acknowledge the work that Siobhan McMahon has done in the campaign to achieve equality of treatment for disabled people across all aspects of their lives.</p><p>The establishment of disability history month in 2010 was an important marker in provoking debate about the profile of disabled people&#8217;s rights. The event serves to act as a celebration of the achievements of disabled people, many of which were listed by Siobhan McMahon. Those achievements are a matter of record, notwithstanding the adversity that disabled people face in their daily lives. Many individuals&#8217; achievements do not attract much by way of publicity, but the Herculean effort and determination involved on the part of the individual concerned mean that such achievements are truly colossal in anyone&#8217;s book.</p><p>As Siobhan McMahon said, this members&#8217; debate is timely because it falls on the eve of the Parliament&#8217;s legislative consent motion debate on the United Kingdom Welfare Reform Bill. That bill, which was introduced by the Tory-Liberal Democrat Government in London, has proved to be extremely controversial because of its likely impact on disabled people. The legislation will impose changes to disability benefit and support that will cut the budget for the disability living allowance by 20 per cent. That is the stated motivation for the changes to be introduced by the bill. It is all about cuts and has nothing to do with fairness or with improving the operation of the system for those who are entitled to some help and support because of their disability. Surely, in a civilised society, the payment of a benefit to assist with a disability should be seen as an entitlement and not a handout.</p><p>It would be instructive for the UK Tory-Liberal Government in London, during disability history month, to reflect further on the deeply damaging impact that the legislation will have on disabled people who will be affected disproportionately in Scotland and who have been placed in a state of fear and alarm. There is no safety net in the proposals. The UK Government should be ashamed of itself and should amend the bill in light of the widespread concerns that have been raised across the spectrum. There are no second-class citizens here in Scotland and it is simply unacceptable to me and to my colleagues that the UK Government, through the Welfare Reform Bill, is content to see disabled people being treated so shoddily.</p><p>As Siobhan McMahon said, disability history month is not just about negatives. It is very much about focusing on positives. I end on a more positive note by mentioning the recent launch of the human rights toolkit for disabled people and their advocates. That is excellent source material and a practical guide for disabled people and for all those who have responsibility for ensuring that the rights of disabled people are respected. It is not enough just to talk about the rights of disabled people; there must be appropriate mechanisms for ensuring that those rights can be enforced. More work needs to be done here, but I am convinced that the publication of that toolkit is a significant step on the way to creating a truly just society in which we can all enjoy our rights as individuals.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I thank you for calling me to speak in the debate and I congratulate Siobhan McMahon on securing it.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657853", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disability History Month"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be called to speak in this important and timely members&#8217; debate on disability history month, which Siobhan McMahon has secured.

I worked for a small legal practice that was well known locally for its pioneering work in taking on cases of domestic abuse in its family law practice. It was started&#8212;members will not be surprised to hear&#8212;by an inspiring female solicitor who has now reached the very top of the legal profession.</p><p>At the time of my apprenticeship, the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 had been in force for only a few years, and some of its provisions were less well understood and quite novel from a court practice perspective. I remember how hard it was on occasions to secure evidence that would satisfy the court such that the sheriff would agree to grant an exclusion order&#8212;indeed, at that time, that was a very rare occurrence in Kilmarnock sheriff court.</p><p>The difficulty was not just down to the novelty of the legislation and the resultant approach of the sheriffs concerned. It reflected the fact that, in many cases, the family of the abused woman did not wish to get involved and would not give a statement. I recall clearly that, on far too many occasions in the cases that I was responsible for preparing for the court lawyer, family members would simply refuse to give any statement. Although they may have witnessed the violence at first hand, heard the violent activity taking place or seen the extensive bruising, many family members felt that, ultimately, it was a matter between the husband and the wife, and it was simply not for them to get involved.</p><p>Happily, those days are past. Much of the credit for that societal change must lie with Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid, which has been a force for good in our country. I, too, congratulate Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid on its 35th anniversary. Among its many activities, it provides refuge at the critical point when a woman has initially taken the decision to flee the family home. That is a brave and hard decision and one that the woman might have taken years to reach&#8212;long years of physical and mental abuse.</p><p>I therefore welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to funding violence against women initiatives. I note that the funding for the current financial year alone is &#163;11.5 million. However, more can always be done, and I believe that we have an opportunity to do something as a result of the return to the Parliament of proposed legislation on minimum pricing for alcohol. I listened to what Jackie Baillie said on that in response to the intervention from my colleague Mike MacKenzie; although I accept that there is a complex mix of issues, one clear underlying issue in that mix is alcohol. A significant number of domestic abuse incidents are fuelled by alcohol. I believe that a failure on our part to take the opportunity to start to change our drink culture will mean that we in turn fail to tackle violence in our society and, in particular, violence against women.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657129", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women (Prevention)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have been called to speak in this important debate.

I wish our NGOs continuing success in those discussions.</p><p>A debate on climate change raises the important issue of individual responsibility. It is axiomatic that, if individual behaviour does not change, we will all fail. I submit, however, that the most effective way of changing individual behaviour is to bring people with us. I believe that the Scottish Government, in particular, has recognised that with its successful climate challenge fund initiative, which seeks to facilitate community-driven projects on climate change. That initiative has been going for some years now and has, I understand, supported about 345 grass-roots projects.</p><p>I have direct personal experience of a very successful community project that benefited from the fund: the Comrie Development Trust&#8217;s Comrie carbon challenge project. I declare an interest at this point, because I did some work for it some years ago, which appears in my entry in the register of members&#8217; interests. In Comrie, where I live&#8212;members will be pleased to hear that it is a very can-do village in its approach to important issues&#8212;there has been a noticeable change in people&#8217;s behaviour and I believe that that behavioural change is continuing apace.

Of course, we must do all that we can here, but we have a good case to take to other countries.

Until the UK Government stops dithering and delaying on that important issue, there is a serious risk that Scotland&#8217;s renewable energy industry will be sabotaged.

As has been said, the starting point is for us to set out what should be our shared ambition for looked-after children. Having heard contributions from all sides of the chamber, I believe that our shared ambition is that looked-after children should have the same opportunities as every other child in the country. That must be the key driver for our approach to looked-after children, because there can be no second-class citizens in Scotland.</p><p>In delivering that objective, the key factor that must always lie at the heart of any decision-making process is of course the need to consider what is best for the child. That must be paramount and it is therefore necessary for each case to turn on its own facts and circumstances&#8212;that is to say, these matters must be dealt with on an individual, case-by-case basis. It is self-evident that each child is different and has a unique set of circumstances. Determining what is right and best for the child can be a difficult balancing act. I pay tribute to all those workers who deal with these issues day in and day out, because they provide a magnificent service to children. It is our job to facilitate ways to ensure that they can do even more for the looked-after children in their care.</p><p>The whole system must be focused on deciding what is best for the child. That in itself means that we cannot set any arbitrary time limits, as may happen elsewhere, because it precludes the possibility of treating each case on an individual basis. However, that is not to say that improvements to the system cannot be made. I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach in embarking on an ambitious set of plans to secure better outcomes for looked-after children in Scotland.</p><p>In that respect, I will focus on three areas of interest. The first, which other members have alluded to today, deals with circumstances in which parental rights are being pursued. In such circumstances, it is inevitable that time&#8212;often, quite considerable time&#8212;will pass as the legal processes are gone through and a conclusion is reached one way or the other. Therefore, it would be worth considering whether, in certain circumstances, it could be appropriate to proceed with concurrent planning, which has been suggested by Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland. As far as I understand its proposal, plans to move a child into a permanent care setting would be progressed alongside plans to keep the child with the birth parents. With such a proposal, one would have to safeguard the rights of the birth parents.</p><p>I heard what my colleague, Stephen Maxwell&#8212;I am sorry, I mean Stewart Maxwell; I will never hear the end of that&#8212;said about balancing the rights of birth parents with what is best for the child. In our legal system, everyone has rights, and we must ensure that our processes respect the rights of the birth parents. The key question is to see what else we can do to facilitate the speeding up of the system. That is an area that is worth exploring, and I hope that the minister will indicate whether the Scottish Government is prepared to do so, together with the relevant agencies.</p><p>It is to be hoped and expected, given the positive developments south of the border, that the launching of the adoption register in Scotland will increase adoptions here and speed up the process. That positive move should be considered alongside two pivotal developments. One is that there is to be promotion by the Government of foster carers becoming permanent or long-term carers. I welcome that development, although I suspect that some foster carers will be wondering why it has taken quite so long to get to this stage. The second development, which is also to be welcomed, is that, after a gap of some 15 years, Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland is to resume adoption and placement services. That will be a significant development in securing better outcomes in the future.</p><p>We have heard this afternoon about permanence and stability. It is clear from the evidence&#8212;we have all read the various briefing papers&#8212;that ensuring permanence and stability will have a significant beneficial impact on the life chances of looked-after children, so it is vital that such goals are embodied at all stages of the system around looked-after children. I welcome the establishment of CELCIS, which I understand will be focused on ensuring that the twin threads of permanence and stability run throughout the delivery of services across the piece.</p><p>There is nothing more important than the future wellbeing of children. Therefore, it is incumbent on all of us&#8212;as individuals and as parliamentarians&#8212;to do all that we can to ensure that children&#8217;s opportunities in life are nurtured and promoted and that no door is closed as a result of any action of, or inaction by, the state. I am therefore encouraged to note the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambitious approach to looked-after children.</p><p>I hope that, in her summing up, the minister will indicate whether, in her on-going monitoring of the various programmes that are being rolled out, she will come back to the chamber to update us on the progress that is being made.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653666", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am pleased to speak in this important debate on reducing the time needed to find a permanent home for looked-after children.

I did not expect to hear about that case today, but I guess that that is just one of those things.</p><p>As a lawyer, the starting point for me in the debate is the fact that the Scottish legal system is independent, even if other areas of life in Scotland are still to catch up&#8212;although I firmly believe that that will happen before long. As a Parliament, we have a duty to do what we can to preserve the integrity of our legal system and to ensure that it works in a coherent way.</p><p>I want to deal directly with the point that Johann Lamont&#8212;who is moving her chair&#8212;raised. The debate is not some exercise in constitutional navel gazing, nor is it a discussion of an issue that has no impact on the real lives of hard-working people, as my colleague mentioned. It is a debate that deals directly with the operation and the efficiency of our legal system, which is important to all of us.</p><p>I very much welcome the comprehensive report that the independent review group led by Lord McCluskey has provided. As the cabinet secretary said, the Scottish Government has accepted the report&#8217;s recommendations, and I understand that the Lord Advocate has written to the Scotland Bill Committee to set forth the kind of provisions that should be included in the Scotland Bill if the recommendations are to be implemented. Kenny MacAskill said that he is now progressing matters in his capacity as Cabinet Secretary for Justice.</p><p>As we have heard, one of the key recommendations concerns certification; specifically, it states that an appeal from the High Court of Justiciary to the UK Supreme Court should be competent only when the High Court has granted a certificate that the case raises a point of law of general public importance. That will deal with the anomalous situation in which certification is required as a matter of principle in the other UK jurisdictions, even if there are exceptions in certain cases. As a general rule, allegations of convention rights incompatibilities that occur elsewhere in the UK do not reach the Supreme Court unless there is certification.</p><p>That goes back, as Alison McInnes mentioned in a slightly different context, to the fact that the House of Lords was the final court of appeal for criminal matters for those other jurisdictions, which is not the case in Scotland as enshrined in the acts of union. When the Human Rights Act 1998 was passed, the certification rule was implicitly extended to cover compatibility cases in the other UK jurisdictions.</p><p>However, even if that was not the case, and there was suddenly no certification system in the other UK jurisdictions&#8212;as I understand it, there has been no significant attempt to abolish that requirement in the rest of the UK&#8212;it would still be necessary, in my view and the view of the McCluskey review group, to ensure that the High Court&#8217;s historical position as the final court of criminal appeal in Scotland was preserved given that we have an asymmetrical set-up in the UK.</p><p>Paragraph 41 on page 15 of the review group&#8217;s report states:</p><p>&#8220;In particular, we seek to ensure that the Scottish criminal justice system, unique amongst the constituent systems of the UK in its historical independence from the apex criminal appeal court for the rest of the UK, should not now, in the area of Convention rights, become more subject to interference from that apex court than the courts of these other systems.&#8221;</p><p>That states the review group&#8217;s position on certification very clearly. There has been interference from the UK Supreme Court, and we need to do something about it now that the opportunity has presented itself in the form of the Scotland Bill.</p><p>Concerns have been expressed about a possible diminution of the individual&#8217;s rights if such a certification system were to be introduced in Scotland, but I simply do not agree. Those concerns are based on a misunderstanding of the UK Supreme Court&#8217;s role. The High Court in Scotland has always been the final court of appeal in criminal matters. It is the competent court, and it is perfectly capable of continuing its centuries-old role. It was never intended that the UK Supreme Court should have jurisdiction over Scots criminal law decisions as if it were a new and final court of appeal in Scottish criminal cases, as the review group has pointed out.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653571", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Criminal Law (Integrity)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I preface my remarks by stating for the record that I am a member of the Law Society of Scotland and that I hold a current practising certificate.

As we have heard from other members, although the UK Government&#8217;s proposals are to be welcomed as far as the improvement of work incentives is concerned&#8212;particularly the universal credit approach&#8212;there are nonetheless significant concerns about the impact that the measures in the UK Government&#8217;s bill will have on the most vulnerable members of our society. In many important respects, the impact of the bill in Scotland will be devastating and disproportionate.</p><p>Significant concerns have been raised this afternoon about the UK Government&#8217;s failure to take into account the situation on the ground in Scotland as regards a number of devolved areas that will be affected by the bill. We have heard about housing benefit and the potential impact on passported benefits. There is also the role that mediation plays in our system of family law, the position of kinship carers and the position of social care policy in general. Many of those issues have been explored and they will require to be explored in great detail in the committee scrutiny that is to come.</p><p>In light of the time constraints in the debate, I will focus on the bill&#8217;s likely impact on the disabled. In looking at the bill, it is instructive to remind ourselves of what appears to be the main driver of the changes to disability benefit and support: the UK Government&#8217;s stated intention to reduce the costs of DLA by 20 per cent by 2013. That is the real agenda; it is not about any meaningful desire to make the system better for those who are entitled to some help and support as a result of their disability. I stress the word &#8220;entitled&#8221; in relation to disability support, because it is not a question of giving a handout to the workshy or a payment to those who seek to defraud the system; the payment of benefit is to assist with a disability, which is an entitlement in a civilised society.</p><p>What do we see when we look at the so-called reforms in the bill? We see that the lower-rate care component of DLA is to be taken away&#8212;a proposal that was made initially by the previous Labour Government at Westminster but was withdrawn ultimately because of the public backlash at the time. We also see that the mobility component is to be taken away from people in residential homes. Questions arise, not least about how the additional cost of transport is to be met to allow those people to participate in social life, educational and learning trips, day services and so forth. Surely not even the Tory-Liberal coalition in London is suggesting that those people should somehow be denuded of those opportunities and should remain indoors, with no other aspect to their lives. We need to hear more about that from the UK Government.</p><p>We also hear that new assessment tests are to be introduced for the new personal independence payment. There is very little optimism indeed that the lessons of the deeply flawed work capability assessment will be learned&#8212;another measure that was introduced by the previous Labour Government. It is important that we remember the 13-year record of the previous Labour Government on disability support.</p><p>Is the UK Government really saying that as far as the new assessment is concerned, general practitioners and specialists cannot be trusted to provide professional medical services? What about the Hippocratic oath, which members of the medical profession take? What staggering disrespect of the medical profession on the part of the UK Government.</p><p>We have also heard about the somewhat interesting underoccupancy rules.

I hope that they will conclude as they listen to the debate that we have properly reflected the enormous contribution that those who sailed the Arctic convoy ships made and that they will feel that we understand the enormous debt that we and our country owe them.</p><p>We have heard that the conditions were absolutely atrocious for the merchant seamen, sailors and airmen who took part in the convoys to supply Russia with essential materials for its war effort, so that it could defeat the Nazis. As my colleague Rob Gibson said, the Russians were grateful for that and are grateful to this day.</p><p>Few, if any, of us in the chamber could possibly imagine what those conditions were really like. We owe the people who were involved a great debt. We have heard of the thousands of lives that were lost as a result of the conditions and the constant attacks from the German army. It is fitting that a museum should be established to ensure that there is a testament to those brave men; to ensure that, as Mary Scanlon rightly said, the memories are not lost and are properly recorded for the benefit of future generations; and to ensure that the appropriate archive material is saved for the nation.</p><p>I know that the local community around Loch Ewe is promoting a museum. It is laudable that there is community-driven grass-roots determination to establish a museum. That is entirely appropriate, and I wish the local activists great success in securing widespread support for the project and, of course, the necessary funding. We are talking about our history, and we should ensure that everybody is aware of it.</p><p>It is, of course, important to ensure that the appropriate medals are housed in the new museum. It would normally be expected that such medals would have been awarded to the brave men who made a vital difference to the war effort at the risk of their lives. That difference cost thousands of lives. However, it has been noted that Westminster has still failed to act, which is greatly regrettable.</p><p>I recall that I raised the issue on a number of occasions with UK Government ministers in my years as a Westminster MP. The ministers then were of a Labour hue, and they failed to act. We now have UK Government ministers of a Tory hue, who have also failed to act. As Rob Gibson mentioned, the Labour Government belatedly introduced, after a concerted campaign, what it called the Arctic emblem badge. That was not what the campaigners fought so hard for, and it was somewhat insulting to the veterans.</p><p>Expectations were raised when David Cameron took office, as he had said on the record that he supported the awarding of medals to the Arctic convoy veterans, but we are still waiting. It is true that, during Prime Minister&#8217;s question time in January this year, he indicated that he was minded to support the awarding of medals, but this is September and we are still seeing further delays.

I recall speaking out on a number of occasions about the risks inherent in the proposals for the integrity of Scots criminal law.</p><p>I argued at the time that there were serious issues about the compatibility of the Supreme Court proposals with the Act of Union 1707, which constitutional experts will be aware preserved the independence of the Scottish legal system and provided that Scots law cases could be heard on appeal south of the border only in a court entirely separate from the English legal system. As far as criminal law is concerned, in light of the fact that the Ministry of Justice has responsibility for running, administering and funding the UK Supreme Court, it is hard to see how anyone could argue that it is entirely separate from the English legal system.</p><p>It may come as no surprise that at the time of the passage of the legislation in Westminster, I argued that there had been a missed opportunity to end the 18th century historical anomaly whereby final appellate jurisdiction in civil cases in Scotland lay south of the border&#8212;a view shared by eminent jurists.

In many high-profile cases, particularly the Cadder case, we have seen the implications of a court furth of our jurisdiction having a role to play in our legal system. Indeed, the Cadder case followed a year on from the McLean case, in which a seven-judge bench in Scotland in the High Court of Justiciary decided that, on the issue in question, Scots criminal law was compliant with the European convention on human rights.</p><p>For Scots criminal law, the key problem with the UK Supreme Court is that it superimposes on Scots law an extra layer of appeal from our High Court, as far as devolution cases are concerned.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am very pleased to have the chance to speak in this important debate on the various wide-ranging issues encompassed by the justice portfolio, and I commend the cabinet secretary and my colleague Roseanna Cunningham for the work that they are doing.

It is clear that he will be a forceful advocate for his constituents&#8217; interests. I am pleased to note his and the Labour Party&#8217;s support for enhanced borrowing powers for the Scottish Government.</p><p>I hope that the political consensus will continue apace in the months to come as we all work together in the interests of the people of Scotland. There are many improvements that I would wish to see made to the Scotland Bill, which will be the focus of political discussions in the coming months. However, I am mindful of the subject of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s motion and will restrict my remarks to the issue of borrowing powers.</p><p>All normal Governments have borrowing powers. They have powers to assist in the managing of cash flows&#8212;something that all of us and all our constituents are becoming expert at dealing with in these difficult economic times, except perhaps for the bankers, who do not yet seem to have quite got it. At the same time, Governments need the flexibility to counter the effects of the economic cycle when receipts are down but demand for services is up. Also, as many members have mentioned, Governments need to have borrowing powers to fund large-scale capital projects. Such powers are particularly useful in economically straitened times, when the use of them can boost the economy and create vital jobs.</p><p>However, under the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish Government&#8217;s borrowing powers are very limited. They are to be used only to support temporary cash shortfalls; there is a cumulative ceiling of &#163;500 million; and the source of the borrowing is a single source&#8212;the national loans fund. The lack of such a key economic tool for improving economic performance is seriously hampering our ability to stimulate our economy, as has been recognised widely across the chamber today. The situation is particularly difficult when we take into account the Westminster cuts of some &#163;1.3 billion that have been imposed on this year&#8217;s budget alone.</p><p>The lack of real borrowing powers is a serious problem for Scotland and for us as we try to grow our economy. As has been pointed out, it is also anomalous in that we seem uniquely to have no real borrowing powers. Local authorities rightly enjoy borrowing powers and, as Maureen Watt mentioned, the Northern Ireland Executive enjoys enhanced borrowing powers beyond those of the Scottish Government. Even English parish councils, which were so favoured by the former Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, enjoy borrowing powers. It is clear that this Parliament and this Government are in an anomalous position.</p><p>There was a recognition of that anomaly in the drafting of the Scotland Bill, and there are proposals that are welcome, as far as they go. However, the key point is that they do not go far enough. As we have heard, there would be a cap of &#163;2.2 billion and there would be no accelerated borrowing, except with Treasury approval, until 2015. It has become clear today that there has been some movement on the timescale of the capital borrowing changes but, as the cabinet secretary rightly pointed out, the devil is in the detail. We will need to see exactly what the Deputy Prime Minister has said before we are able properly to comment on it.</p><p>It is clear that the powers do not go far enough. That was recognised by the work that was done by the Scotland Bill Committee in the previous session. Of course, that committee recommended that the powers be enhanced, which is what we are here to discuss in more detail today.</p><p>We support the increasing of the cap, although as has been said perhaps a better approach would be to set a prudential framework for borrowing that is based on principles of debt sustainability. However, if there is to be a cap, a higher cap would be of more use to the Scottish Government. As Gavin Brown said, we would not have to go to the cap; the point of the exercise is to have the economic levers available to the Government to do the job that is necessary for Scotland, which is to boost our economy.</p><p>That is what we hope to achieve. The attitude that is taken in another place remains to be seen, but it is quite clear that today in the Scottish Parliament we have the opportunity to state quite clearly what our position is.</p><p>I will conclude&#8212;to allow more time for the other speaker to whom you referred earlier, Presiding Officer&#8212;by noting that, during the election campaign, the SNP argued strongly across the length and breadth of Scotland for the strengthening of the powers of this Parliament, including enhanced borrowing powers. Of course, on polling day, the people of Scotland returned 69 SNP MSPs and, therefore, a majority Government. It seems clear to me that the people of Scotland have spoken on the issue of enhanced borrowing powers and that we, as their Parliament, should today do likewise.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648395", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill: Borrowing Powers and Growing the Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mr Pentland on his maiden speech.

For me, it was also an extremely long day, as mine was the last result to be declared. I hope very much that, in this Parliament, it is a case of last but not least. I also hope that I can acquit myself as well as some of my family members who have been privileged to serve as members of this Parliament. I speak of my mother, Winnie Ewing; my late sister-in-law, Margaret Ewing; and my brother, Fergus Ewing, the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, who is here today&#8212;I hope that that is a help and not a hindrance to my performance.</p><p>I have parliamentary form, of course, as I have some experience of another Parliament. I promise to be on my best behaviour in this Parliament, however. I suspect that there will be less provocation in this Parliament than in that other place south of the border. I clarify that I am happy to take interventions because I plan to be controversial, which picks up on the fair point that Margo MacDonald made this morning.</p><p>The election on 5 May was an historic event in Scottish political life, for it emerged quite clearly that the people of Scotland had voted for the politics of hope over the politics of fear.

However, the results on 5 May raise certain key questions as to how the other political parties that are represented in this Parliament will react to these changed times. I sincerely hope that they will take the necessary time to reflect on the results and be bold in their new thinking, so that they can catch up with the ambitions of the people of Scotland and are not left behind. However, after some of the contributions that we have heard during today&#8217;s debate, I am perhaps less sanguine than I was when I started off this morning. I refer in particular to the comments from the leader of the Lib Dems in this Parliament; I see that neither he nor any of his colleagues is in their place. I feel that some further reflection on his part on the role that his party previously enjoyed in Scottish politics and the role that it now enjoys would be instructive.</p><p>One of the first key opportunities for everyone to demonstrate that they have caught up with the voters&#8217; aspirations is to support the SNP Government&#8217;s efforts to revisit and improve the Scotland Bill that is currently back at Westminster for legislative consideration.
