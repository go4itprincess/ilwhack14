Any opportunity to shed a little more light on this shadowy but increasingly prevalent industry is welcome.</p><p>A decade ago the creation of new drugs was much rarer, which afforded authorities the opportunity to properly assess the risk. Now, their emergence at a record pace of more than one a week, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, demands greater attention. The centre points out that</p><p>&#8220;the speed with which new drugs appear means that, as soon as one new psychoactive substance is identified by the authorities and controlled, a replacement is already on the shelves.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Drugs Forum has described the problem as a &#8220;moving target&#8221;.</p><p>Legal variants of existing drug compounds are being manufactured on a commercial scale for sale through so-called head shops, the internet, illicit sellers and reportedly even from convenience stores and petrol stations, as we heard from the minister. The ease with which they can be procured is worrying. Many of them come in professional-looking packaging with branding to make them appear more legitimate; others provide no information at all. However, one thing is certain: consumers do not know what they are buying. The legality, strength, purity and effect of the substances can vary significantly, even among what appears to be the same product.</p><p>The experience of the drugs service Crew 2000 suggests that user dependency is becoming more common, that many people underestimate the dosage and that, as we heard, the majority mix new psychoactive substances with other substances such as alcohol, making them more potent.</p><p>My colleagues from the north-east Alex Johnstone and Graeme Dey mentioned the two head shops in Arbroath that have been the subject of local controversy and attracted significant local media attention. That is partly because the most recent shop is situated just two doors away from a drop-in centre operated by St Andrew&#8217;s church for people who are contending with alcohol or drug addiction. As Alex Johnstone said, local residents have responded by forming the group Arbroath against legal highs.</p><p>I understand that such shops represent only a small corner of the market, but they are unmistakable. Given that cigarettes are now hidden from public view, residents are understandably asking whether it is right that such shops are able openly to display and promote new psychoactive substances and drugs paraphernalia. The evidence must lead us to ask how we can best protect the public. How do we ensure that the law is not rendered ineffective by what strikes me as a reckless and unpredictable market?</p><p>I turn to the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach. The concerted effort to use the term &#8220;new psychoactive substances&#8221; or &#8220;NPS&#8221; instead of &#8220;legal highs&#8221; strikes me as apt. The label &#8220;legal highs&#8221; gives the substances more credibility than they should have as it suggests that products are acceptable or safe when that is not the reality. Consumers should be under no illusions. Many of the products have not been properly tested. In the absence of dependable information on new drugs, education and early intervention play an increasingly important role in enabling people to identify the dangers and understand for themselves that they are putting their health at serious risk if they do not know what harmful substances the products contain.</p><p>I welcome and support the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to working with its partners, including the know the score campaign and Police Scotland, to raise awareness, particularly among young people. The inclusion of new psychoactive substances in the drug-related death statistics is good a step forward, but it is important that we gather more evidence. We need to understand what draws people to these substances. In the context of Scotland&#8217;s problems with drugs and alcohol, it would also be valuable to establish to what extent new psychoactive substances interact with other substances and whether they may be so-called gateway drugs.</p><p>The minister mentioned trading standards. It would be helpful for the Scottish Government to follow the UK Government&#8217;s example and produce guidance for local authorities on enforcing trading standards legislation with regard to shops that operate in this area.</p><p>There is no doubt that it is essential to take a multi-agency approach but, as others have said, neither Scotland nor the UK can deal with the problem in isolation, as the industry transcends national boundaries. We should work closely with our UK and EU partners to share knowledge, anticipate new threats, maximise the authorities&#8217; ability to conduct investigative forensic analysis and research, determine risk and build our capacity to confront the challenge.</p><p>The coalition government has already put in place the forensic early warning system and it has banned some 200 substances, but I am pleased that the Liberal Democrat Minister of State for Crime Prevention, Norman Baker, is going further and leading a Home Office review to examine how other countries&#8217; regimes differ from ours. I understand that it will report back later this year, and I am sure that the Scottish Government awaits its findings with interest, as I do. We have a responsibility continually to monitor what is working elsewhere, explore alternatives and consider whether there are more effective ways in which to respond.</p><p>The minister&#8217;s approach is sound. We should have practical, sustainable policy that is shaped by the advice of professionals, from scientists to youth workers and health professionals to the police, focused on prevention and harm reduction and enhanced through collaboration and innovation, and it must be informed and led by the evidence of what works, not guesswork or populism.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22884031", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Psychoactive Substances"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am grateful to the minister for arranging this debate and for providing an update on how the Scottish Government is seeking to confront the challenges posed by new psychoactive substances.

On the eve of the international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation, which is sponsored by the United Nations, I add my voice to those who are calling for an end to this most brutal abuse of girls and women.</p><p>FGM is recognised internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and it constitutes an extreme and brutal form of discrimination against women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of children&#8217;s rights. The practice also violates a person&#8217;s rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and indeed the right to life when the procedure results in death.</p><p>According to UNICEF, more than 125 million women worldwide are living with the consequences of FGM. They are concentrated in countries across western, central and eastern Africa, but FGM is also practised in communities in the middle east, Asia and the Americas and in diaspora communities all over the world.</p><p>FGM is usually performed on children. In 50 per cent of practising countries, girls undergo FGM before the age of five. As others have said, it is generally carried out by unskilled practitioners who use unsterilised instruments and no anaesthetic, risking potentially lethal infection. Other consequences include severe pain during urination, menstruation, sexual intercourse and childbirth and, of course, psychological trauma.</p><p>This systematic violation of women&#8217;s rights has for too long been a taboo subject, but throughout the world calls for an end to FGM are gaining strength. In 2012, under the leadership of the African group and with strong European Union support, the general assembly of the United Nations adopted a landmark resolution. In March 2013, my Liberal Democrat colleague Lynne Featherstone, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for International Development, announced the biggest ever international investment&#8212;&#163;35 million&#8212;in eradicating the practice. In November last year, the European Commission released an action plan on ending female genital mutilation.</p><p>There is growing momentum for change, but we must take action here in Scotland, too. As others have said, the Scottish Government has estimated that at least 3,000 women and girls are at risk here. That is based on a pro rata estimate. Nevertheless, that working estimate exposes a lamentable and much-neglected child protection issue for Scotland to tackle.</p><p>As other members have said, FGM has been a specific criminal offence in the UK since 1985, yet there has not been a single prosecution. A recent BBC programme revealed that the majority of health boards cannot say how many cases they have encountered, less than a third of our councils have local guidelines on FGM, and the police have had no referrals from health boards. How can that be?</p><p>According to 17-year-old Fahma Mohamed from Bristol, who is leading The Guardian&#8217;s campaign to end FGM, that is because</p><p>&#8220;People just don&#8217;t talk about it, doctors don&#8217;t check for it and teachers don&#8217;t teach it&#8221;.</p><p>She is campaigning for our schools to do more. She says:</p><p>&#8220;We need to act now. Many girls are sent away to be cut over the summer holidays. Some are cut at home. They call it the &#8216;cutting season&#8217;. If every headteacher was given the information they need to talk about FGM to students and parents we could reach every girl who is at risk before the holidays. We could convince families not to send their daughters to be cut and we can help girls who are at risk. We could break the cycle so the next generation is safe.&#8221;</p><p>She is right. The legal framework and enforcement are important, but they are not sufficient to end FGM&#8212;changes in attitudes and beliefs in the affected communities will be key.</p><p>Most survivors of FGM need help to cope with the short and long-term consequences of the procedure. Giving them adequate support would help to raise their awareness of the damaging health consequences of the practice.</p><p>Some countries, such as Belgium, France and Italy, have set up health centres that specialise in the care of victims. Health professionals are best placed to lead on identification, prevention and treatment, but we should draw together many partners in education, social services, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the police, as well as in minority ethnic women&#8217;s organisations that are working to raise awareness, such as Saheliya, the Dignity Alert and Research Forum, Shakti Women&#8217;s Aid and the Scottish Refugee Council.</p><p>Jenny Marra rose&#8212;</p><p>Do I have time to take an intervention, Presiding Officer?</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22882339", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Female Genital Mutilation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Jenny Marra on securing this important debate.

I repeat the committee&#8217;s thanks to all those who made representations to us. In their dealings with the committee, objectors and supporters have been courteous and reasonable, and all parties have presented their arguments in a coherent way. Committee members have certainly had no shortage of reading material, but I assure everyone who submitted evidence or objections that we read it all and reflected carefully and at length on the points that were made.</p><p>I will start with some brief comments about common good land, which is an area of law that can give rise to complexities and uncertainty. The evidence that we received from witnesses who have experience in the area suggested that it can often be difficult to establish whether common good land is alienable or inalienable, because that might involve consideration of factors including how a burgh came into possession of the land and the use to which it has been put.</p><p>Interestingly, one commentator noted that prior to 1996, the park was the responsibility of City of Edinburgh District Council as a recreational asset, while education was a function of Lothian Regional Council. As Cameron Buchanan explained, had it been proposed then that the land be used for educational purposes, that would have involved a transfer from the district council to the regional council, following an application to the court for authorisation. That would have been a disposal under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. With the introduction of unitary authorities, such a transfer would have been an appropriation by education from recreation&#8212;rather than a disposal&#8212;which is not possible under the 1973 act. The bill seeks to remove the legal obstacle to appropriation, which currently prevents the building of the new Portobello high school on Portobello park. It is clear that there is a legal obstacle at the moment, and it is also clear that there is a pressing need for a new school. Kezia Dugdale spoke passionately about that.</p><p>The bill is narrow in its remit, as a private bill should be. It seeks only to allow the appropriation of a specific clearly defined piece of land by another department of the same authority, and only for the purposes of education.</p><p>From the many emails that we have received this week, I know that many people are not happy with the committee's preliminary conclusions and, indeed, challenge our right to have reached those conclusions. Nevertheless, the fact is that the committee has, after due consideration, concluded that the bill conforms to the definition of a private bill, so we recommend to Parliament that it proceed to the next stage.</p><p>I will now return to some of the issues that were raised in the committee's consideration of evidence. The committee is keenly aware of the benefits and value in urban areas of open space such as Portobello park. With that in mind, we sought to clarify what measures the council proposed to compensate for the loss of that space. We appreciated that such measures were not in themselves part of the bill, but we wished to clarify what the status of any such replacement space would be, particularly in view of the potential loss of the &#8220;inalienable&#8221; status of the park.</p><p>As part of the committee&#8217;s site visit to the park, we also visited the current high school site to see what area would be covered by the proposed replacement space. We also sought clarification from the promoter about what safeguards would be put in place in relation to that area. We were reassured by the promoter&#8217;s commitment to protecting the area from a future change of use by giving it Fields in Trust status which, we understand, would consist of a legal agreement with the National Playing Fields Association, which dedicates such areas to public use and recreation and similar uses in perpetuity. We have also urged the council to consider similar protection for the area of open space that would remain at the park following the proposed construction of the school.</p><p>In considering the general principles of the bill, the committee&#8212;in addition to receiving written and oral evidence from experts in common good law&#8212;heard from the promoter; from Portobello park action group, the main objector; and from the group Portobello for a new school, who are supporters of the bill.</p><p>As part of the requirements of the private bill process, promoters are obliged to set out in the promoter's memorandum details of the pre-introduction consultation that was carried out regarding the bill&#8217;s proposals. Other members have talked about that. The promoter went into some detail in the memorandum regarding the measures that it had taken to make the consultation in its view a meaningful exercise. Those included the distribution of information leaflets to individual households, a number of exhibition and roadshow events, and two public meetings.</p><p>Objectors, however, presented arguments alleging serious flaws in the process, including a shortened consultation over the Christmas holiday period; the lack of a balanced approach in relation to the content of leaflets, presentations and displays in public areas; the survey format, and the analysis of results.</p><p>Although we noted the lengths to which the promoter appeared to have gone to publicise the consultation, to engage with those who would be affected and to highlight the planned introduction of the bill, we also noted the range of claims and levels of dissatisfaction with the process that were detailed in objections. In our report, we encourage the promoter to reflect on lessons that have been learned during the process.</p><p>At this point, it is probably worth noting what the committee has not done. The committee did not feel that it was appropriate for it to take a view on issues that are properly for the council to reach a position on. For that reason, we did not explore the detail of the review or the options appraisal, or issues such as planning conditions.</p><p>As the convener and Fiona McLeod have already stated, the committee was very conscious of the concerns that have been expressed by objectors and others in relation to the possibility of the bill&#8217;s setting a precedent for local authorities to use the private bill process as a means of undermining the protection that is afforded to inalienable common good land. I therefore welcome the minister&#8217;s clear statement that the bill will have no direct consequences on common good land elsewhere.</p><p>Although the committee accepts that it will be open to other councils to follow the private bill route if they so choose, each case would have to be considered based on its own circumstances and on its own merits, as others have said. We are, therefore, satisfied that the precedent argument is not sufficient to prevent the bill from continuing to consideration stage.</p><p>Alison Johnstone talked about the need to strengthen assurances. The committee will seek amendments to the bill at the next stage to ensure that, should the park no longer be used for the proposed purpose, its inalienable status would be protected. That should reassure those who have concerns about the park&#8217;s future status. On the question of replacement open space, I refer again to the promoter&#8217;s commitment to protect the area by giving it Fields in Trust status.</p><p>I am pleased to support the motion that the general principles of the City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill be agreed to, and believe that the bill should proceed as a private bill.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22830480", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: City of Edinburgh Council (Portobello Park) Bill: Preliminary Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First of all, I extend my sympathies to the deputy convener of the committee and will, in his absence, close the debate on the committee&#8217;s behalf.

That is essential if we are to preserve the integrity of those relationships and, in turn, the integrity of the buildings or open spaces concerned.</p><p>The committee has identified a number of areas in which the act has arguably fallen short of expectations. For example, it has been criticised for being complex, incomprehensible or impractical for home owners who want to exercise their right to switch property factors.</p><p>The committee concluded that more could be done to foster a culture of common maintenance and tackle home owner apathy through education and the formation of residents associations. That would help to preserve and enhance the quality of our housing stock, and I welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to produce guidance on that.</p><p>In the limited time that I have, I would like to highlight the need to further consider the relationship between home owners&#8212;most commonly in modern private developments&#8212;developers, councils and landowning property maintenance companies. I expect that the majority of MSPs, if not all, have been contacted by constituents who have experienced difficulties with businesses operating in this area. It is certainly an issue in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.</p><p>There are cases where residents believe that the maintenance of communal areas has not occurred for months or even years; cases where residents are pursued for payment for work that they believe has not taken place; and cases where residents are faced with what they deem to be unjustified rises in management charges.</p><p>I have long been concerned that there seems to be insufficient means of redress for home owners who are dissatisfied with the standard of service that is provided. They are often left feeling helpless and bound to a company against their will. It strikes me as perverse that those who have the foremost interest in the condition of those spaces too often have no opportunity to influence or contribute meaningfully to their management.</p><p>I appreciate that the situation appears to have improved in recent years, as the committee acknowledged in its report, but there still seems to be no mechanism for dealing with disputes about charges, and in reality there is no option for people to change their provider if the service falls short of expectations.</p><p>The committee suggested that a mediation service could be set up to assist with bill disputes, and that the Office of Fair Trading may wish to re-examine the market. Those suggestions are worthy of serious consideration, and I am a bit disappointed at the Government&#8217;s response, which suggests that little progress will be made in either of those areas despite the fact that the committee has deemed them a priority.</p><p>The decision by local authorities to transfer the burden of responsibility for the maintenance of communal areas is a pragmatic response to limited budgets, among other pressures, but they must retain a long-term interest in the condition of communal space. Maintenance of public open space is of a different order&#8212;as it is of community benefit&#8212;to the maintenance of shared private interests such as roofs or stairwells.</p><p>I urge local authorities and the Government to heed recommendation 8 in our report, and to use the levers at their disposal to ensure that land maintenance arrangements are fair and sustainable. That will help to promote good relations and allow urban green spaces and amenity lands such as play parks to be cherished, as we know how valuable those are for the whole community in boosting physical activity and mental health, attracting investment and creating places where people want to live. We must also remember the practical considerations, such as the fact that, in this day and age, those spaces may provide sustainable urban drainage schemes, and the failure of SUDS schemes will have a wider community interest that goes beyond particular private owners.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22830498", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join colleagues across the chamber in thanking those who submitted evidence during the review of the practical operation of the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003 and in thanking the clerks for their work during the course of the inquiry.

First, we must ensure that there is sufficient support for the financial advice and education sector. We therefore support the committee&#8217;s view that more work is needed on the provisions for the advice sector to establish whether the requirement for money advice will place an additional burden on those who offer advice.</p><p>We also share the view that a pilot financial education project&#8212;or, at the very least, careful monitoring of financial education outcomes&#8212;may be helpful before mandatory provision, as set out in the bill, is introduced. It seems to me that there is little point in having an enforced system of financial instruction if it cannot be shown to have a positive impact.</p><p>Of course, the debt advice that is given to individuals in what can be very difficult and stressful situations must be the right advice, given in the right manner and in a timely fashion. There should therefore be recourse for people who are given bad advice.</p><p>We very much welcome the work of the Accountant in Bankruptcy and Money Advice Scotland on developing a module for a national standard for financial capability education. Learning how to budget and manage money better is an invaluable skill to teach our young people. Education early in life on money management and financial services is essential if we are to ensure that our young people have the life skills that they will need throughout adulthood.</p><p>I have listened to the minister&#8217;s points. Nevertheless, we continue to have reservations on the extension of debtor contribution orders to 48 months. The four-year bankruptcy would mean that those who are in very difficult financial situations would pay for longer, which may cause additional financial hardship. That could lead to debtors breaking agreed payment schedules, as we heard from Hanzala Malik.

It encompasses domestic abuse, rape, child sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, commercial sexual exploitation, forced and child marriages, honour crimes, stalking, verbal and emotional abuse and vile online bullying and abuse. It is a litany of misery that can be summed up by another three little words: abuse of power.</p><p>I pay tribute to the many organisations that work with the people who are affected by such violence. I acknowledge the progress that has been made and note that Police Scotland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service have recently undertaken welcome initiatives on the issue.</p><p>However, we do not need to look far to find examples of how much more needs to be done. I will give just a few. In September, Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid&#8217;s annual census showed that, on one day in Scotland, 341 women and 257 children were living in a Women&#8217;s Aid refuge. On that same day, a further 809 women and 319 children were supported by a Women&#8217;s Aid group.</p><p>Last month, a video emerged of the University of Stirling&#8217;s men&#8217;s hockey team taking part in offensive and misogynistic chanting on a packed public bus. Last week, Laura Bates&#8217;s everyday sexism project, which documents women&#8217;s daily experiences of gender inequality, hit the 50,000 mark: it has collected 50,000 stories of abuse and harassment. Here is just one them:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only 14 yet almost every conversation I have with a guy involves them asking for nudes, my bra size and trying to sext me, and when I say &#8216;Please stop&#8217; or &#8216;No, you&#8217;re rude&#8217;, I&#8217;m called a bitch, whore and slut and they eventually stop talking to me. I&#8217;m 14 and this is considered normal for girls my age.&#8221;</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, a team at the University of Bedfordshire published &#8220;A qualitative study of gang-associated sexual violence towards, and exploitation of, young people in England&#8221;. I grant that it looked at the situation in England, but there are lessons for us to learn. It makes chilling reading and demonstrates just how little deep-rooted attitudes have changed in our country. I despaired when I read:</p><p>&#8220;Boys are predators, girls are prey, innit?&#8221;</p><p>That was the view of a 16-year-old boy. A young woman at a focus group explained fatalistically:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m used to it ... It&#8217;s normal ... It&#8217;s wrong, but you get used to it ... Welcome to our generation&#8221;.</p><p>My goodness, there is a lot yet to do.</p><p>I therefore welcome the development of Scotland&#8217;s strategy to tackle violence against women, but fine words alone will not bring about the kind of change that we need. We need a shared understanding and approach that must be at the forefront of everyone&#8217;s minds every day. The report &#8220;Scotland&#8217;s National Action Plan for Human Rights 2013-2017&#8221;, which was published last week, recommended that the strategy must be accompanied by an action plan. SNAP priority 6 urges that we adopt a comprehensive human rights-based strategy to tackle violence against women.</p><p>It is clear that we need to see investment in work that tackles the root causes and creates an understanding of women&#8217;s inequality as a cause of violence against women. I urge the minister to ensure that the strategy prioritises work with young people in our schools, colleges, universities, workplaces, youth groups and young offenders institutions. We must do so much more to promote understanding of healthy relationships, equality and respect.</p><p>I will read from the foreword of the piece of research that I mentioned earlier:</p><p>&#8220;The final message therefore is that each of us has a role to play in combating the attitudes exposed in this report. From national and local government through to communities and individuals, we must support boys and young men to value healthy relationships and to understand &#8216;consent&#8217;. We must work with all children to ensure that women and girls are treated with respect, that there is a clear message that the sexual objectification of females will not be tolerated, and that children are brought up with hope and opportunities, channelling their energies and resourcefulness for their own and society&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p><p>The strategy would do well to embody those words.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22813683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The phrase &#8220;violence against women&#8221; is made up of three little words, but involves so much pain.

Although in Scotland we are fortunate to have a system of support for victims and witnesses, it became crystal clear during the bill process that there is much more to be done to ensure that victims are treated with dignity and respect and given proper support and protection. The passing of the bill will enhance the rights of victims of crime and of those who witness such harm. In addition, the national confidential forum will address the needs of those who have suffered historical abuse.</p><p>Rightly, much of the focus throughout the bill process has been on delivering improvements for the most vulnerable in our society. At stage 1, there was dismay among victims and those who speak for them about the proposal to allow objections to the use of standard special measures, which are existing safeguards that allow children and vulnerable witnesses to give evidence without appearing in the courtroom. Victims organisations argued that the proposal would undermine all the other provisions and rights in the bill, which was a pretty damning verdict. I was therefore pleased to secure an amendment at stage 2 that means that those individuals&#8217; rights will not be eroded, and I am grateful to the cabinet secretary for his support on that.</p><p>Given that the bill seeks to ensure that the system works better for victims and that Scotland complies with the relevant EU directive, I considered the initial omission of restorative justice to be significant. Again, I lodged an amendment at stage 2 to that effect, and I am grateful to the cabinet secretary for his support on that and for his amendment on the issue at stage 3. Over the years, Parliament has increasingly recognised that restorative justice services can in the right circumstances assist victims to overcome their experience, achieve a greater understanding of why they were a victim and have an opportunity to receive a genuine apology. In turn, it can inspire those who have caused harm to reflect on their actions and take personal responsibility. Some excellent restorative justice services already operate, but I believe that they have too often developed in a piecemeal fashion. I hope that the inclusion of the section on restorative justice will highlight their value and instil greater consistency in the system.</p><p>On restitution orders, I believe that, had the Government set its mind to the issue, it could have extended the system to include fire and ambulance service personnel, and I am disappointed that it did not endeavour to do so. It is a greater disappointment to me and to many other members that the Government did not take the opportunity to give added protection to victims of sexual offences by supporting Graeme Pearson&#8217;s or Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s amendments on that. That remains unfinished business.</p><p>No one chooses to be a victim or a witness of crime, and it is therefore incumbent upon us to ensure that victims and witnesses are heard and to seek to make the whole process, from the moment a crime is first reported to the point where an offender completes their sentence, less intimidating and less distressing.

The plan reminds us that human rights define the way in which we are treated and determine our opportunities and the extent to which we are free. It helps to cut through the dangerous perception that human rights are abstract or immaterial, that they are an obstruction to justice or that they should not necessarily be universal.</p><p>In identifying the areas in which human rights can be better protected and how that can be achieved, the plan poses challenges and opportunities. In the brief time that I have, I will focus on a number of those. The document challenges the Scottish Government to improve conditions of detention and highlights problems with overcrowding, access to mental health services and vocational and educational opportunities. It also presses on the need to implement the recommendations of the commission on women offenders. Those are all issues that I have spoken about in the chamber and which must be considered a priority.</p><p>Elsewhere, the plan presents an opportunity to improve the quality of care for vulnerable and older people so that they are not only treated with the respect and dignity that they deserve, but empowered to remain autonomous&#8212;as far as possible&#8212;and supported to realise their rights through personalised provision.</p><p>The plan challenges us to promote a</p><p>&#8220;consistent understanding and respect for human rights&#8221;</p><p>in mental health care and treatment.

In particular, the focus is on the need to end the totally objectionable enforcement of electroconvulsive therapy on patients who resist or object to that treatment.</p><p>The plan notes that we have a responsibility to create a better world through respecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights internationally. It recognises that Scotland&#8217;s obligations</p><p>&#8220;do not stop at its borders&#8221;</p><p>and that such considerations must be at the heart of the Government&#8217;s international framework and bilateral engagements. Our values cannot be traded away.</p><p>The action plan is not a wish list; rather, it should provide stimulus to further embed human rights in the way that we do things, from the first legislative proposals to the delivery of services and the subsequent monitoring processes.</p><p>Before concluding, Presiding Officer, I agree with Jean Urquhart that Jenny&#8217;s amendment would have been better dealt with in a debate of its own, but I nevertheless support her amendment.</p><p>Parliament must act as a champion for the action plan and I hope that it will have regular opportunities to consider its progress. That will be essential.</p><p>Earlier today, the Parliament celebrated and reflected on the life of Nelson Mandela.

I have witnessed the remarkable journey that the city has been on. The sense of determination among its people to bring about change is admirable.</p><p>Many years ago, while I was still an Aberdeenshire councillor, I visited the city on a planning study tour to see the importance of public open space and public art in urban regeneration. What Dundee City Council was doing then was on quite a small scale compared to the regeneration that we are witnessing today, but it carried the hallmarks of creativity, imagination and determination that have propelled Dundee to this important tipping point.</p><p>What a regeneration there has been. The city&#8217;s approach&#8212;first, to recognise that a cultural renaissance could be a powerful catalyst for change and, secondly, to harness that cultural energy&#8212;makes Dundee a very special place, and the UK city of culture team has recognised that by shortleeting the city. Feedback at the time of the shortleeting said that the bid was particularly strong in respect of how it talked about the city&#8217;s journey over the past 10 years, using culture to regenerate the city through Dundee Contemporary Arts, the McManus galleries and museum, the Dundee Rep theatre and the fabulous V&amp;amp;A at Dundee.</p><p>The judges were positive about the consultation, and were especially impressed with how the team engaged with people through the we Dundee website, which Jenny Marra has spoken about, as well as with the number of people who have been involved. Council members, universities, community and cultural groups, young and old people, businesses and local media have all pulled together to make the best possible case for Dundee. My Liberal Democrat colleague Councillor Fraser Macpherson told me recently that</p><p>&#8220;the all-party working together to positively support Dundee&#8217;s bid, has been the best example of co-operation between politicians of all political hues in many a year.&#8221;</p><p>I echo that.</p><p>Dundee would be an outstanding choice for the accolade of UK city of culture, and I fervently hope that it is successful. There is nothing superficial about the bid, which addresses the real needs of Dundee. It does not shy away from the stark fact that a third of the city&#8217;s population lives in the poorest 15 per cent of areas in Scotland. It does not ignore the fact that Dundee&#8217;s educational outcomes are poorer than the Scottish average, nor does it gloss over the fact that the current level of participation in cultural activity in Dundee is divided between the poorer and the better-off areas. Dundee&#8217;s bid is about social regeneration through culture, and the step change will be to use culture and creativity to enable a more confident community to evolve that will address those inequalities. Dundee will use the year of culture to connect different parts of the city more effectively, and to ensure that those who live in its deprived communities are able to enjoy fully the benefits of its creative and cultural resources. That would be a truly lasting legacy, which we should endorse.</p><p>On the wider impact, I believe that there will be significant benefits for the whole North East Scotland region. At the core of the economic impact will be increased visitor spend and an uplift in economic activity related to culturally led tourism. VisitScotland has recognised that the north-east underperforms at the moment and that Dundee has a key role as a city that is at the centre of a region of great natural beauty. The visitor impact of the year of culture would be an increase of 50 per cent in the total number of visitors to Dundee during the year, and a sustained higher level of visitors beyond that. The combination of completion of the V&amp;amp;A, the development of new hotel opportunities and the improvement of transport links also places Dundee in a great position to attract cruise ships, as well as UK based tourists.</p><p>Dundee: &#8220;One city, many discoveries&#8221;. All of us can praise that vibrant city but, truth be told, there are still too many Scots&#8212;and, indeed, visitors from further afield&#8212;who have yet to visit Dundee and find out for themselves what is there to be discovered. I hope that the city of culture bid will encourage a great many more people to make their own visits of discovery.</p><p>I congratulate The Evening Telegraph on its campaign. It was uplifting to read some of the online comments about what people love about Dundee. One comment summed it up for me:</p><p>&#8220;Dundee people are proud of a city which has seen hard times but is reinventing itself as a modern city which embraces change and new opportunities.&#8221;</p><p>I have no doubt that this should be Dundee&#8217;s moment.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740380", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dundee City of Culture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a regional member for North East Scotland, I am privileged to represent the city of Dundee.

Historically, it has developed in a piecemeal manner. As a result, too often it seems disjointed and perplexing to legal professionals and lay people alike. The reforms will also secure the independence of tribunals&#8212;that is overdue.</p><p>Having a tribunal consider a case can be a defining, stressful and even traumatic time in someone&#8217;s life. Clear and consistent rules and procedures will help users&#8212;who often have no experience of the civil justice system and find it daunting&#8212;to overcome any anxiety and to access proper redress.</p><p>I will take the opportunity to highlight some of our reservations. They are key issues that we need to examine further at stage 2, to ensure that the tribunals system is sensitive, just and transparent.</p><p>At the end of the bill process, we want tribunals to be better placed to make decisions and reach the right conclusions. The intentions are good, but we must be alert to unintended consequences. We must be sure that the system provides greater depth of expertise&#8212;not a dilution of that&#8212;among tribunal members. That is why we must not allow the specialist knowledge and intrinsic character of tribunals to be eroded to the extent that they are indistinguishable from courts, which other members have touched on. The tribunals must continue to offer a comparatively faster resolution, at lower cost and in a less intimidating environment&#8212;be it a hospital or a community centre.</p><p>The focus on service users&#8217; needs, the comparatively informal and inquisitorial approach to cases and the fact that lay experts sit alongside legal professionals all contribute to ensuring that tribunals have a distinctive role and a unique integrity. Concern has been expressed that the bill could compromise those qualities. The committee therefore suggested that the principles that underpin the tribunals system&#8212;the things that define it and set it apart from the courts&#8212;should be enshrined in the bill. I know that the minister is instinctively cautious, but I welcome the fact that she is willing to consider that further.</p><p>As other members have said, concern has been expressed about what has been described as the potential judicialisation of tribunals. The proposed merger of the tribunals system with the Scottish Court Service could lead to more judicial practices being rolled out in the tribunals system, if it is simply absorbed. Tribunal members might be referred to as judges, which we know would make many of them uncomfortable.</p><p>The Law Society is concerned that the value of the ability of first-tier tribunals to access the judiciary when making decisions will be undermined if judicial members do not have the necessary expertise. We need sufficient safeguards, such as the need for presidential discretion to be respected and for the relevant chamber president to be consulted when judicial appointments are made. In its report, the committee asked the Government to consider that, so I hope that the minister will reflect on it further.</p><p>Since the consultation on tribunals reform was launched, concerns have repeatedly been expressed about the Mental Health Tribunal&#8217;s future. That subject attracted by far the most comments during the 12-week consultation period. That tribunal is very different from the other devolved tribunals that are set to be transferred from 2015. It has immense power over the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in our society; it has the power to detain patients in hospital and to decide where they will reside. It can rule to give people treatment for mental illness against their will. As the minister said, it can also deprive people of their liberty.</p><p>The extremely sensitive matters that the Mental Health Tribunal considers mean that it must retain its existing highly specialised expertise and experience. However, the bill provides that it could&#8212;conceivably&#8212;become part of a multijurisdictional chamber in the future. I listened carefully to the minister&#8217;s speech and found some reassurance in it, but should we be satisfied with that tribunal being transferred into a chamber of its own in the first instance? The Scottish Government seeks to establish an overarching framework, but sufficient protections need to be in place for the Mental Health Tribunal. It is therefore right to consider further whether the tribunal should be guaranteed its own chamber through primary legislation. An amendment to its status would then require a further act of Parliament, which would allow for proper scrutiny and consideration. However, the proposal at the moment is to use regulations.</p><p>Vulnerable people, people on low incomes and hard-working families typically cannot afford to incur costs in accessing justice, so we must guard against that becoming the norm rather than the exception in the tribunal system. I welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment to considering whether the position can be strengthened at stage 2 in order to ensure that financial barriers to justice are not erected in the future.</p><p>We will listen closely to what the Government has to say on those issues as the bill progresses through Parliament. I am confident that we can work on them constructively. I hope that that approach will result in the bill striking the proper balance between the need to make the system more consistent and transparent and the needs of service users&#8212;those often vulnerable people whose needs must remain our focus.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22732166", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunals (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Despite having a few concerns that we believe need to be addressed at stage 2, the Liberal Democrats support the bill in principle.

To portray it in the way that SNP members have done in the debate&#8212;that bobbies on the beat somehow trump everyone else&#8212;is trivialising and damaging.

Intelligence analysts, custody officers, community wardens, control room staff and counter desk staff&#8212;we could go on for ever&#8212;are the people who have helped us to reach the 39-year low in recorded crime. The Government is quick to laud that figure but it seems all too slow to recognise the role that police support staff have played in achieving it. That 39-year low in crime&#8212;a trend across the UK&#8212;is due to the hard work of the legacy forces and testament to the community-based policing model.</p><p>In the past two years, 1,400 civilian posts have been lost.

More than 6,000 hours of public contact will be lost each week and police control rooms are to close. That is more than just an inconvenience for people; it is indicative of a wider problem: the new police service does not recognise how important community policing and public trust are to reducing and preventing crime.</p><p>The mantra from the Government members of 1,000 extra officers no longer fools many people.

I therefore welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision to examine how the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 could be reformed in order to reflect those principles.</p><p>I believe that the act can and must work better for both offenders and the communities that they have harmed and to which we return them. I am sure that, like me, many members will have had constituents visit their surgeries to express concerns about the act&#8212;constituents who have reflected on their actions, regret their crimes and now believe that they are being unduly prevented from moving on. That is often particularly true of those who committed crimes when they were young. Making a single mistake, or a bad choice driven by desperation or foolish audacity, can shut down a young person&#8217;s chance of getting on in life at all.</p><p>For the most part, once the rehabilitation period has expired, we treat individuals as though they had never committed the offence. I agree that that is right if they do not pose any continuing risk, but the question is: at what point should we wipe the slate clean? In England and Wales, the coalition Government reforms mean that convictions that result in custodial sentences of up to 48 months can now eventually be considered spent. It has amended&#8212;and I think for the most part reduced&#8212;the length of the rehabilitation periods. Both those proposals are worthy of consideration.</p><p>We must ask whether Scotland has it right. Is it right that convictions that result in prison sentences of over two and a half years will never be considered spent? Is it right to send out the message that these people can never be fully rehabilitated?</p><p>Often sentences are longer now than they were in 1974, which means that convictions for some crimes that would once have been considered spent must now forever be disclosed. If we are to avoid isolating people and driving them back into criminal activity, we need to think very carefully about the barriers that we erect that might prevent ex-offenders from getting a job, somewhere to live, a bank account or qualifications.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary stressed, however, those who are considered to pose a continuing risk must continue to be required to disclose their past activities. In the most serious cases, some categories of employment must remain out of bounds, because safeguarding vulnerable groups must remain the paramount concern.</p><p>If we are serious about reducing reoffending, the Government needs to recognise that too many people are sent to prison, particularly on short sentences. Alternatives such as community-based justice programmes and diversion-from-prosecution projects are often more appropriate, more valuable and more successful in reducing reoffending, especially among young people who need help to get back on track.</p><p>We have already heard how important education is&#8212;it is vital to help people to achieve their potential. However, despite all the progress that we have made, too many youngsters are still missing out. We must do more to ensure that disruptive and challenging children are not excluded from school. Why? Because we know that those who are excluded from and disenchanted with school often end up entangled in the justice system.</p><p>For those who are in prison, the Government must do more to provide meaningful learning and training activity. For example, education programmes represent an opportunity for prisoners to learn a new trade, to gain qualifications and to turn over a new leaf. However, on average, only one third of Scotland&#8217;s prisoners engaged with a learning centre in each month between December 2012 and May 2013. Let us be more imaginative about that&#8212;it could be worth considering whether an offender&#8217;s whole-hearted participation in gaining literacy skills, training and personal development courses should lead to an earlier spent conviction.</p><p>We must do more to encourage prisoners to acquire the tools that let them break the cycle of reoffending, reintegrate with society and make a meaningful contribution to their communities once they are released. That is really important.</p><p>Research demonstrates that, when ex-offenders gain employment, the risk of their reoffending reduces dramatically&#8212;by between a third and a half. Prison staff in the north-east have told me that the region is unique, because many ex-offenders can walk straight into a job as a result of the significant skills shortages that the area is experiencing. On release there, ex-prisoners perhaps have greater prospects than those elsewhere in the country.</p><p>I want that sense of opportunity to be the norm, not the exception. Instead, 30 per cent of offenders are reconvicted within one year of release. Feelings of disengagement and resignation are all too often the norm. The cost of the damage that that causes to the communities that offenders harm economically and socially is huge.</p><p>Reforming the 1974 act will have a key role in determining the future of the thousands of people who are in our prisons and in determining whether they return to prison or to communities. We must ensure that the reformed system is proportionate and that it encourages and enables people to start afresh when appropriate.</p><p>However, as I outlined, legislation is just one mechanism that is available to the Government. To reduce reoffending successfully and to enable people to become law-abiding citizens requires imagination and innovation. We cannot afford to fail the people whom we are trying to rehabilitate or the communities to which we will return them.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation of Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scotland needs a robust yet compassionate justice system&#8212;a targeted and flexible justice system.

However, I do not defend corroboration because of tradition; I defend it because it protects against miscarriages of justice, false accusations, wrongful convictions and the erosion of the presumption of innocence.</p><p>The fact is that we cannot remove this pillar of our justice system without making the whole structure unstable. In other jurisdictions, in the absence of a corroboration rule, a series of alternative checks and balances is built into the trial process. For example, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have greater regulation of police investigations, and preliminary hearings to test the quality of evidence. Judges have the power to exclude poor-quality or prejudicial evidence, unanimous verdicts are required in the first instance and there are wider grounds for appeal following an unsafe conviction. In comparison, the additional safeguards that are currently proposed here are utterly inadequate.</p><p>The bill will mean that someone could be convicted on the basis of the testimony of one person, even if five of the 15 jurors believe that they are innocent. Witnesses can be honest yet mistaken. Unfortunately, witnesses sometimes lie to the police and in court, out of eagerness to ensure that the accused is convicted, because of the strength of their convictions or through spite. Furthermore, scrapping corroboration could mean that false accusations become more common. The Law Society of Scotland warns that trials could be reduced to</p><p>&#8220;a contest between two competing statements on oath&#8221;.</p><p>We cannot allow trials to hinge on lesser evidence.</p><p>I accept that we must strive to ensure that the victims of rape, sexual assault and domestic abuse get justice. Liberal Democrats whole-heartedly share the Scottish Government&#8217;s aspiration to improve conviction rates in that area but, sadly, rape conviction levels are not high in other jurisdictions, either. It would take significantly more changes to attitudes across society that are deep and complex for progress to be made.</p><p>The research that the Government cites in support of scrapping corroboration to that end is scant&#8212;as the convener of the Justice Committee said, it comprises a simple desk-top study by the Crown Office. In the absence of clear in-depth evidence, it would be reckless to proceed in blind hope.</p><p>In addition, there is a real risk that scrapping corroboration could reduce the chances of victims of such crimes securing justice. Police investigations might become less rigorous, and even if we get more cases into court, there is no evidence that we would secure any more convictions. The alleged victim could face a much more aggressive cross-examination. Juries are less likely to convict on the basis of one piece of evidence. More acquittals or not proven verdicts in such cases will not help anyone.</p><p>No one should be beyond the reach of our justice system, so we should examine other ways of tackling the problem. For example, should rape victims be represented by a lawyer in court, as happens in Belgium? Should we adopt a much more rigorous approach to the gathering of forensic evidence?</p><p>The majority of Lord Carloway&#8217;s recommendations are sound and should be implemented, but I am extremely concerned that incorporating such a profound change into the wider package of court reforms will mean that it is not given the due consideration that it deserves. I support Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s motion.</p><p>Corroboration should not be seen as a barrier to justice&#8212;a cumbersome requirement that blocks cases being taken to trial. It does not simply deliver a quantity of evidence; it ensures the quality of it. It is the key to determining the guilt or otherwise of the accused.

We hope that today&#8217;s move will be the first step towards allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in all elections in the UK.</p><p>I am deeply disappointed by the position of the majority of members on prisoner voting. Outside this Parliament, there is a growing consensus on the matter, which has been stubbornly ignored by three parties in the Parliament. There is not yet consensus on which prisoners should vote, but there is consensus that it is simply wrong to continue to deprive every person in prison of the fundamental right to participate in our democracy.</p><p>It is correct that we punish offenders, but our primary aim must be to rehabilitate them. If we are serious about that and about reducing reoffending, we must ensure that prisoners are more engaged with society.</p><p>Voting is not a duty that we impose on people; nor is it a privilege that can be revoked at the slightest cause. It is a fundamental right of every member of a free and fair society, which we should not remove lightly.</p><p>All too often during our debates on the matter, I have heard opponents fall back on the argument that the situation should stay as it is because that is how it is.

It is right that we seek to protect and enhance the rights of witnesses to and victims of crime. Crime is a story of people whose lives have been adversely affected through the actions of others. It is vital that, when working on justice reforms, we remember that and all do what we can to provide support and protection for those who are affected by crime.</p><p>Although we are fortunate in Scotland to have access to well-developed voluntary services, much more is still to be done. It is vital that our laws offer the best possible protection to victims and witnesses so that support organisations are at their most effective.</p><p>I will focus briefly on a couple of the bill&#8217;s key points, before touching on a few matters that it does not yet cover.</p><p>Quite rightly, much of the focus has been on the proposed improvements for vulnerable witnesses. I welcome in particular the right to an individual assessment for all vulnerable witnesses to determine the most appropriate special measures to assist them. The widening of eligibility for those special measures is also welcome.</p><p>We must acknowledge that there is dismay among victims and those who speak for them about the proposals to allow objections to special measures. In particular, the VOCFS&#8212;the victims organisations collaboration forum Scotland&#8212;and the Commissioner for Children and Young People have challenged us to look again at the matter.</p><p>The VOCFS argues cogently that that approach will not only create uncertainty for witnesses but, in the case of children&#8212;who currently have an automatic entitlement to special measures&#8212;lead to a dilution of their current protection. The VOCFS argues that it is illogical to extend eligibility for special measures on the one hand while allowing the granting of special measures to be challenged on the other. The VOCFS goes so far as to say:</p><p>&#8220;If implemented, this provision will result in an increase in the number of witnesses re-victimised by the process of going to court ... we consider that it will undermine all the other provisions and rights contained the Bill.&#8221;</p><p>I listened to what the cabinet secretary said in his opening speech about engaging further on the matter. I urge him to give careful consideration to amending the bill in light of such strong representations. At the very least, children&#8217;s rights must be protected and not eroded in any way. I am keen for the committee to take further evidence on sections 9 and 13 of the bill at stage 2, if necessary.</p><p>The other area that has attracted a lot of attention is the so-called victim surcharge. In the debate during the consultation on the bill last year, I mentioned the Liberal Democrats&#8217; slight unease with the plan. Our long-term vision is to increase the amount of paid work that takes place in prisons. As part of that, we could develop a means of taking a contribution from prisoners&#8217; wages, which would be used to provide additional funding for victim support measures. That would re-emphasise the need for all offenders to make reparations over the course of their sentence.</p><p>I now turn to matters that are not in the bill. At committee, there was discussion&#8212;as there has been this afternoon&#8212;of the creation of a victims commissioner and the introduction of case companions. I understand why those could appear to be positive measures, but they each have practical problems.</p><p>Commenting on a possible victims commissioner, Louise Johnson of Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid said:</p><p>&#8220;we already have very good links with the Scottish Government, and we have direct links to people at very senior levels in the Crown Office and the police ... We do not think that another body&#8217;s intervention would help us at all. Why should we have to go through an intermediary?&#8221; &#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 16 April 2013; c 2617.]</p><p>I agree.</p><p>Similarly, while on the face of it case companions might offer a reassuring presence, they could in practice cause significant problems with information flow.</p><p>There are a couple of suggestions that I believe are worthy of further exploration at stage 2. The first of those relates to anonymity orders, which were mentioned in the consultation but did not make it into the bill. It is thought that, because such orders are in use in England and Wales, certain issues may arise with cross-border cases. I would be grateful to hear the cabinet secretary&#8217;s view on the issue; perhaps it is something that we can return to.</p><p>I want also to mention the brief discussions that we had in committee&#8212;which are mentioned in the report&#8212;on a right for victims to a review of a Crown Office decision not to proceed with prosecuting a case. Members will be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales recently announced a consultation on plans that would enhance the right to appeal against Crown Prosecution Service decisions not to prosecute.</p><p>As a result of an EU directive, it is incumbent on us to ensure that victims have the right to have a decision reviewed. I acknowledge the Crown Office&#8217;s view that its current arrangements are compliant with the directive; I also acknowledge that the Crown Agent has commissioned a review to consider whether the arrangements in Scotland can be further enhanced. I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of that review, given the importance of the right and the context of the bill, but I am minded to agree with Victim Support Scotland that there is a strong case for us to include on the face of the bill a right to a review of a decision not to prosecute.

I back its campaign for a better bus pass scheme. This is not the first debate that we have had on extending the national concessionary travel scheme to community transport schemes, but we are still waiting for the Government to listen, understand the problem and take action.</p><p>The issue is fundamentally one of fairness. The national concessionary travel scheme that was introduced by the Labour-Liberal Democrat Executive has largely been a success. The scheme&#8217;s objectives were twofold: to allow older and disabled people, especially those on low incomes, improved access to services, facilities and social networks by free scheduled bus services to promote social inclusion; and to improve health by promoting a more active lifestyle for the elderly and disabled.</p><p>By and large, the majority of our elderly and disabled citizens have indeed reaped the benefits of the scheme. They can get out and about and travel without worrying about the cost. For those who are on fixed incomes such as pensions, that is a real advantage. But here is the rub: for a significant minority, their bus pass is invalid on the services that they rely on. They cannot travel for free; they have to keep counting the pennies, which limits their opportunities to remain involved in their community and means that they struggle to get out to the shops, their general practitioners or social clubs.</p><p>Too many elderly and disabled people are at a financial disadvantage&#8212;they have a bus pass that is worthless. In remote rural areas, people cannot use their bus pass because there are no scheduled buses for them to travel on. Throughout Scotland, people with mobility problems find that they have a bus pass that is valid only on buses that do not meet their accessibility needs.</p><p>Setting up such an ambitious scheme from scratch could not have been easy. I do not criticise the previous Executive for the anomalies that have since become apparent. After all, it had the foresight to say that the scheme would need to be reviewed after three years to see what needed to be amended. Sadly, the review that was carried out by the Scottish National Party a few years ago did not take the opportunity to make the national scheme more inclusive and address the problems that I have mentioned. However, we can make the scheme fairer. I urge the Scottish Government to commit to doing so.</p><p>It is worth considering some facts from Age Scotland&#8217;s research. While 87 per cent of people in Scotland aged 60 or over have a national concessionary travel card, in large urban areas that figure rises to 91 per cent of older people, compared with just over three quarters in rural areas. The majority of older people have an NCT card, but a significant proportion of them do not use it, particularly those who live in rural Scotland. Almost half&#8212;47 per cent&#8212;of those who live in remote rural areas and 43 per cent in accessible rural areas do not use their card, compared with about a third throughout Scotland and a fifth in large urban areas. In remote rural areas, more than two thirds&#8212;70 per cent&#8212;of those who are aged 60 or over either do not have a card or do not use it. That is a lot of people being short-changed by the current system.</p><p>It is clear that the full benefits of concessionary fares are not felt in rural areas and areas that are less well served by traditional bus services. That problem is likely to grow. As commercial bus operators continue to withdraw from routes on the grounds of cost, it will become more of an issue in our cities, too. Those elderly and disabled people who rely on the lifeline that is community transport have to pay their own fares. Who can say that that is fair?</p><p>Meanwhile, there are many people still in work who benefit from free bus travel. I am sure that we can all recall how the previous transport minister liked to wave his pass around in the chamber. Is that fair?</p><p>Age Scotland has costed its proposals and identified how to fund them. It asks us here in the Parliament to take a mature and consensual approach to tackling this issue.</p><p>Around 3.5&#160;million community transport journeys are made each year, and the average price of a single community transport journey is approximately &#163;3.20. Reimbursing that at a full 100 per cent reimbursement rate would cost around &#163;11.2&#160;million. It is entirely sensible and fair to suggest that that additional cost should be funded by adjusting the eligibility criteria for the existing scheme in line with changes to the state pension age. I emphasise that I do not suggest that we change the criteria retrospectively. The change would not affect anyone who has a bus pass at the moment.</p><p>When money is tight, we must make it work hard for us and ensure that it is spent wisely. There is a chance to refine the scheme to make it fairer. Who could really object to such a change? It is a virtuous proposal&#8212;equal dibs for all our elderly and disabled citizens, wherever they live. Our elderly and disabled would be able to afford to use community transport services more often, which would lead to a more secure future for our community transport providers, which in turn would be able to provide more services. The result? More active, less isolated people and reduced demand on health services.</p><p>Research has identified that loneliness and social isolation carry a higher risk than lifelong smoking. Isolation is linked to depression, and a lack of social interaction with the onset of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s. We know that nearly a fifth of older people do not speak to friends or family on a daily basis. We also know that by keeping older and disabled people independent, active and connected in their communities, community transport makes people&#8217;s lives better and improves their health. That is well in keeping with the aims of the national concessionary travel scheme.</p><p>Community transport meets social needs like no other transport service can. It is a cost-effective way of supporting some of society&#8217;s most vulnerable people, which we must maintain. Extending the bus pass to community transport will help to make it more sustainable. More important, it is the fair thing to do.</p><p>Age Scotland&#8217;s case study booklet illustrates that very well. Let us hear from some of the people in it. Margaret from Dumfries says:</p><p>&#8220;I have a bus pass but it&#8217;s of virtually no use to me. I&#8217;ve spent most of 2012 sitting at home waiting to die.&#8221;</p><p>Another Margaret, from Carradale, says:</p><p>&#8220;A lot of the discussion these days is about keeping older people &#8216;interested in things&#8217;. We are interested in things&#8212;we just can&#8217;t get to them!&#8221;</p><p>Helen from West Lothian says:</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a prisoner in my own home as I get older but the current bus system doesn&#8217;t allow me to do many of the things I want to do.&#8221;</p><p>Tina from Kingussie says:</p><p>&#8220;Just being on the bus was a social occasion. I miss that side of things. There should be link ups, I can&#8217;t be the only person around here who can&#8217;t drive.&#8221;</p><p>Surely we owe it to the Margarets, to Helen and Tina, and to all the others out there to try to make the situation fairer.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692563", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Concessionary Travel Scheme (Extension)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am very pleased to have secured a debate on Age Scotland&#8217;s still waiting campaign and I thank other members for supporting my motion.

Lives are ruined, communities are blighted and potential is lost.</p><p>Considering those who are in our criminal justice system, we can see that we have failed to get to grips with the underlying problems&#8212;mental health problems, a history of abuse, addiction, poverty, exclusion from education and being in the care system. We know what lies behind the chaotic lives that lead to prison. Worse, we also know what makes a difference. Reoffending rates remain stubbornly high, however.</p><p>Liberal Democrats want safer communities, people brought to justice when they offend and robust community justice schemes. We also believe that everyone deserves a chance to get back on track. A robust but compassionate targeted community justice system that is flexible enough to respond to individual needs will benefit everyone in Scotland.</p><p>I agree with the cabinet secretary that the status quo is clearly not an option. The Angiolini and Audit Scotland reports both highlighted serious shortcomings in the operation of the community justice system, and the Justice Committee has seen clear evidence of failings in the system. The Angiolini report had some frank words to say about the lack of leadership up until now. For sure, it will take strong and sustained leadership, both nationally and locally, to make a difference.</p><p>Audit Scotland found a mismatch between the services that are provided and what we know works in tackling reoffending. It found that access to and availability of services varies significantly throughout Scotland. While CJAs have been successful in bringing people together, Audit Scotland reported that the way in which they were set up and the inflexible funding arrangements that are in place have limited their effectiveness. Audit Scotland concludes that funding for community justice services is particularly inflexible and does not encourage reductions in reoffending. Only a small amount of funding is currently available for local discretion, and the funding is based largely on historical activity.</p><p>The CJAs report to ministers and have regional budgets to dispense to local authorities, but they also have little discretion and a lack of clear governance arrangements. I acknowledge that good work is going on, but I cannot legitimately argue that what we have at the moment is the right model.</p><p>I agree with the Labour Party that although it is good to have an exploratory debate on this complex issue, it would be useful if we could come back to it once we have all had the opportunity to review the consultation responses.</p><p>Faced with the fact that a number of the other agencies involved&#8212;the Scottish Court Service, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the Scottish Prison Service and now the police&#8212;operate nationally, some might be tempted to say that we should also have a national community justice organisation. I am instinctively uncomfortable about that option. Like it or not, a complex web of societal interactions need to come together to prevent reoffending and ensure that community justice disposals provide both punishment and alternatives. A national agency&#8212;possibly remote and bureaucratic&#8212;is unlikely to be able to maximise those connections.</p><p>Audit Scotland made much in its report of the number of people round the table at CJA meetings. In fact, we need everyone working together. The real problem at the moment is that no one has the proper clout to bring about the change that is needed.</p><p>Criminal justice social work is rightly part of the local government family. We need to develop and build on those close links between criminal justice services, social work, education, drug and alcohol services, disability services and of course the third sector. Those connections have meant that there has been progress on tackling the root causes of crime. I am concerned that removing criminal justice social work from the local authority family would be expensive and disruptive and might lead to the loss of integration with other local services.</p><p>On the other hand, disbanding the CJAs completely and returning responsibility to our 32 separate local authorities will not address the current problems of poor integration and postcode-based justice services. What we need is a structure that facilitates a tailored, community-based response, while ensuring that a much more rigorous approach is taken to the standard of service that we should expect to see throughout Scotland. I am probably with Christine Grahame on this issue. None of the three options outlined in the consultation document seems quite to fit the bill. I suspect that the answer lies in a hybrid form of them.</p><p>It seems at this stage that the best way forward would be to reform the CJAs by ensuring that they have the right&#8212;indeed the responsibility&#8212;to plan, co-ordinate and monitor services in their area. Clearer governance, proper control of budgets and building on what is good in CJAs is likely to bring about change most effectively. However, there also needs to be a national strategy&#8212;one that sets standards and ensures equality of access to services, especially in relation to specific groups such as sex offenders, young offenders and women prisoners. Leadership needs to be provided nationally to champion all the change that needs to come about. It might be that a federation of the CJAs working in tandem with the Government could drive that forward; if necessary, we could have joint commissioning of regional specialisms at the same time. However, if we are to reduce reoffending drastically, at the heart of it all has to be local, community-based solutions.</p><p>Over and over again at the Justice Committee we have heard how patchy throughcare is for short-term prisoners because there is no statutory provision for them, yet we know that those prisoners are most at risk of reoffending. I genuinely urge the cabinet secretary to use this opportunity, this year, to extend statutory throughcare to all prisoners. He would have our support for that.</p><p>Recent research by the Prison Reform Trust concluded that it is important for offenders to take responsibility for their own resettlement. Right now, there is no dialogue with or involvement of offenders or ex-offenders.

We have heard from John Swinney how he believes that that is the case. It is also an opportunity to pursue some of the Government&#8217;s policy priorities. The new powers could be used to design a system that incentivises the reuse of empty properties and the development of brownfield sites as well as tackling fuel poverty and climate change. However, I fear that the Government has not been quite as ambitious as it could have been in designing the land and buildings transaction tax.</p><p>Members have spoken about the shift from the current slab structure to a more progressive one. That sounds appealing, but I have a concern about the impact of the change on house prices. The proposed new system avoids the sudden increases in liabilities that are a feature of the slab system and create distortions in the market. That sounds attractive, but does anyone lose out from that? The distortions in the market are where house prices cluster below &#163;125,000 and &#163;250,000. The Government&#8217;s proposed system will remove the incentive for sellers to price their property below those thresholds, and house prices could increase as a result.</p><p>Although I recognise that the feedback from witnesses has been supportive, we must bear in mind the fact that the committee heard evidence only from estate agents and house builders, which are hardly neutral players in the debate. I do not think that we have really heard the views of those who are trying to buy property. Therefore, I press the cabinet secretary to reassure us that he has considered the specific impact of the bill on property prices. There is a nagging worry that, under the Government&#8217;s plans, buyers in particular regions of the market may end up paying more for their houses.</p><p>The other issue that I will focus on is the lack of measures that will contribute to the Government&#8217;s priorities on tackling climate change and poverty. I note what the cabinet secretary said to Ken Macintosh but, like him, I believe that we must use all the levers that we have in our toolbox to change behaviour. The zero-carbon homes relief has not been included in the bill on the basis that it did not achieve its objectives, and I know that the relief attracted very few applications. Nevertheless, there is still a good case for including in the bill a relief that is related to energy efficiency. Two thirds of respondents to the Government&#8217;s consultation wanted the tax to support key Government priorities, with energy efficiency being by far the most supported priority. I therefore ask the cabinet secretary to give further consideration to that at stage 2. The witnesses who gave evidence to the committee made it clear that&#8212;as other members have said&#8212;the energy efficiency of a property is not a top priority for buyers at the moment, but perhaps it ought to be.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome today&#8217;s stage 1 debate on the first of a series of bills that are being introduced as a result of a number of tax-raising powers being devolved by the Scotland Act 2012.

I emphasise from the start that the Liberal Democrats are not against change. Where a case has been made and evidence listened to, we are happy to work constructively to deliver an improved service. However, I am struggling to find many improvements in these proposals.</p><p>Reading through the consultation document, the responses and the final recommendations, I am left with the overwhelming sense that the changes are not about making our court system better but, first and foremost, are about cutting &#163;1 million from the Court Service&#8217;s revenue budget. That is not a good way to approach the reform of something as fundamentally important as our courts.</p><p>We know that once the Government introduces the order it will come to the Justice Committee and that only if the committee rejects it will the whole Parliament be able to vote on the plans. Therefore, I hope that my fellow committee members will not mind my mentioning their fine words in defence of their local courts. I trust that they will continue to stand up for them so robustly when we get a chance to vote on the order.</p><p>Peebles sheriff court is one of those scheduled to be closed, and Christine Grahame has argued strongly for its retention. The court&#8217;s new facilities are less than 10 years old and, in common with many of the smaller courts mentioned in the consultation, its closure would add a great deal of inconvenience for court users, particularly with regard to travelling time. Christine Grahame has also mentioned the importance of localism, a subject to which I will return.</p><p>At the other end of the country, the closure of Dingwall sheriff court has also been proposed. John Finnie has rightly highlighted that the geography of the Highlands has largely been ignored, and has expressed similar concerns about the closure of the court at Wick. Moreover, as we have just heard, Cupar court in Fife has been proposed for closure, with most cases being moved to Dundee. That throws up a number of concerns; indeed, in what must be one of the most comprehensive consultation responses that I have ever read, Roderick Campbell highlights 14 separate arguments that call into question the decision to close Cupar. I hope that he will not mind it if I add a 15th argument to his list. Shifting trials from Cupar to Dundee does more than simply force people to cross the Tay; it takes the disposal of those cases away from the Fife and Forth Valley community justice authority area, the local police command area and the local NHS board area into an entirely separate local authority area. Surely such a move will have huge implications for managing offenders in the form of throughcare, support for rehabilitation, social care and so on.</p><p>Before I turn to the north-east, I must also mention Rothesay. There are, of course, particular problems with removing all court services from Bute. I know that both the local MP, Alan Reid, and MSP Mike Russell are united in their opposition to the closure and I certainly agree with them.</p><p>In my region, Stonehaven and Arbroath sheriff courts have both been put forward for closure and I have serious concerns about both proposals. For a start, the combined business of Forfar and Arbroath totals more than the available sitting days for the court in Forfar. However, in common with much of its response to genuine concerns from members of the public and interested organisations, the Court Service document is rather dismissive of the point and simply notes that</p><p>&#8220;Consolidation of all court business in a single location offers greater opportunity to manage business more efficiently&#8221;.</p><p>Similarly, with Stonehaven, a major concern is that if Aberdeen court is to absorb the extra business, the already overloaded schedule will get even further behind. However, the Court Service&#8217;s response states:</p><p>&#8220;the period between first calling of a summary criminal case and trial in Stonehaven is 10 weeks as against Aberdeen&#8217;s 20 weeks.&#8221;</p><p>As for the question of how the service is working to reduce &#8220;Aberdeen&#8217;s 20 weeks&#8221;, the response says only &#8220;we are addressing that&#8221;. Again, I ask: how?</p><p>I cannot be the only one for whom this offhand approach to issues has started alarm bells ringing. Before we even consider closing a court, we have to know that every possible impact has been addressed satisfactorily. I do not believe that the Court Service has cast more than a cursory glance at the impacts. It is even more of a worry that the cabinet secretary has moved to accept its plans without even drawing breath.</p><p>At the heart of this is a problem that I have brought up time and time again in the chamber: the erosion of local services. Liberal Democrats are passionate about local decision making and locally delivered services; in contrast, the SNP proves time and again that it is a party of centralisation. It simply seems incapable of understanding Scotland&#8217;s rural communities.</p><p>Justice is best served when it is delivered locally and I have to wonder whether the cabinet secretary finds it a bit incongruous to be standing up and defending the closures today when next week he will be leading a debate on redesigning the community justice system. I fear for the content of that redesign because communities have been wantonly ignored in this one. We are seeing this approach not only with the sheriff and JP courts but with the High Court as well, although we have no control over that. Halting High Court sittings in Dundee, Inverness and Perth is a further case in point.</p><p>The Court Service has taken a very blinkered approach to the redesign and, by blithely accepting all the recommendations, the SNP Government has once again failed to support Scotland&#8217;s rural communities. The SNP proposes a move away from a locally delivered justice system; instead, we will be left with regional delivery that incorporates the worst of all worlds. I intend to vote against the plans when they come before the Justice Committee, and I hope that members on all sides will do likewise and stand up for their local communities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689343", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Lewis Macdonald, I was disturbed to learn last Friday that the Scottish Government had, with barely a week&#8217;s consideration, decided to accept the complete set of Scottish Court Service proposals.

Sadly&#8212;and I know that members on all sides are as unhappy about this as we are&#8212;the Liberal Democrats get only one day of debating time a year. That day is today and we would not want to disappoint the First Minister again.</p><p>I want to start by taking the Cabinet Secretary for Justice&#8217;s mind back to the first day of stage 2 of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill. He might recall rejecting one of my amendments; actually, he rejected them all, but when he rejected this one in particular he said:</p><p>&#8220;It would let ministers off the hook ... as ministers could not be held to account&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 29 May 2012; c 1350.]</p><p>Given what has since unfolded, we will be only too happy to hold him to account for his decisions.</p><p>Members on all sides know the Liberal Democrats&#8217; position on the single police force: we were not in favour of the principle, the detail or the reality. However, we are where we are and I have no intention of standing here and trying to argue that we can put the genie back in the bottle. Now we join with all sides in wanting to ensure that the new police force works.</p><p>During the bill&#8217;s passage, members from all sides of this chamber raised genuine concerns and all parties lodged positive and constructive amendments. We know that the Government has its majority and that we cannot make it listen to reasoned opposition, but the fact that it chose to wilfully ignore such opposition reflects poorly on it. Such an attitude ill befits a Parliament that is meant to be reflective of the Scottish people.</p><p>As we have all seen, since the appointment of the members of the Scottish Police Authority and the new chief constable at the tail-end of last year, an on-going dispute has been played out in the media that the Government has been curiously hesitant to step into. Back in November, the First Minister told Willie Rennie that there were &#8220;creative tensions&#8221; between Vic Emery and Stephen House and, in December, Kenny MacAskill told the chamber that discussions between Mr House and Mr Emery had been &#8220;fruitful and progressive&#8221;. Imagine our surprise to find out that the Government had brought in the Lord Advocate to back up its view on how the legislation should be read; that, in January, one of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s senior civil servants wrote to Vic Emery to tell him that the Government was</p><p>&#8220;of the view that the proposed arrangement is unbalanced, confusing and would place the Police Service of Scotland in a unique and invidious position&#8221;;</p><p>and that Vic Emery responded by saying that:</p><p>&#8220;the Board&#8217;s reservoir of patience with the protracted nature of resolving this kind of issue is already running low.&#8221;</p><p>My colleagues on the Justice Committee will know the feeling. I think that we will all agree that our dealings so far with the SPA have been frustrating.</p><p>I admit that the Government is in an interesting dilemma. By stepping in, it will have to admit that there are shortcomings in the legislation; however, it will at least be able to make the changes needed to ensure that the SPA has a clear and defined role. Alternatively, if it keeps on defending its law, it will have to watch as the SPA&#8217;s self-determined remit threatens the effectiveness of the single police force before it even starts policing. Perhaps we should be relieved that the Government has stepped in to at least try to get the SPA back on track, even if it looks like being too little, too late.</p><p>At the heart of the problem is the democratic vacuum that has been created within our police service. In three weeks&#8217; time, the Government will turn its back on a system in which locally elected members appoint police chiefs, scrutinise police actions and manage police budgets. Instead, all those things will be done by the SPA, which is an unelected board appointed on the say-so of the Scottish ministers. Even if members think that that is acceptable&#8212;and l, for one, do not&#8212;surely we can all agree that the SPA&#8217;s responsibilities should be so fully defined in law that there can be no confusion over how its relationship with the police service works.</p><p>The Government has handed the 13 people on that authority a &#163;1 billion budget and oversight of Scotland&#8217;s entire police service. We must ask: &#8220;Who watches the watchmen?&#8221; As it is, the Parliament has been circumvented. We had no role in appointing the SPA; we are confined in how we can scrutinise it and the new police force; and we were ignored in strengthening the law. So much for democracy within the new police service. All the power is in the hands of the cabinet secretary, and it is up to him to find a long-term solution.</p><p>The three aspects that we highlighted in our motion are staffing, human resources and budgeting, but we could have listed more. In each and every one of them, the problem is the same. The SPA has interpreted the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 in a way that will give it direct, hands-on control over fundamental aspects of our police service. What started as a disagreement over human resources has snowballed out of control. It was clear to all&#8212;or to nearly everyone, apart from the SPA&#8212;that the planned approach on that was simply not fit for purpose. It was not in keeping with the intention of the act, even if, thanks to the Government&#8217;s legislative complacency, it was within the legal interpretation. Had the Government stepped in early to clarify matters, that might have been the end of the disagreements but, instead, it stood idly by and the Parliament, bereft of input, was forced to do likewise.</p><p>We now know that the Government did not agree with the SPA&#8217;s interpretation. We also know that, when it advertised the chief constable&#8217;s position, it stated that he would have</p><p>&#8220;direction and control over 17,000 officers and 6,500 police staff&#8221;.</p><p>So when the authority was allowed to get its own way&#8212;mostly&#8212;on human resources, it decided to flex its muscles and to test where else it could expand its remit. Even where agreement has been reached, it seems clear that Mr Emery has not really changed his views. He has compromised so that things can progress, and I do not doubt that the SPA will return to the matter.</p><p>All that has led us to the situation in which an experienced authority member feels that it could rightly be their role to question decisions that the police make on how they carry out active criminal investigations. Whatever the Government&#8217;s vision of the future of Scotland&#8217;s policing was, surely it was not that. We must be very concerned about what other aspects of policing the SPA might try to take an active role in in the future.</p><p>In the Justice Committee, members from all parties agree that it is imperative for the Parliament to take a more proactive role in scrutinising the new police service and the SPA. Indeed, later this afternoon, the Parliament will be asked to approve the establishment of a sub-committee on policing. I understand that that will be the first time that we have ever set up a sub-committee in the Parliament. That demonstrates the importance that the Justice Committee places on the matter. The six members of that sub-committee will be tasked with providing the same democratic oversight that was previously carried out by dozens of police board members from around Scotland, if they possibly can. The sub-committee will also be tasked with monitoring the SPA. However, it is in the Government&#8217;s hands alone to curb the SPA when it overreaches itself.</p><p>We should be under no illusions. The changes that were voted through in the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 represent the biggest shake-up of policing in Scotland for a generation and mistakes will inevitably have been made. That is the case in almost any piece of legislation that runs to 130 pages, but it will be all the more so when Opposition concerns are so directly ignored. The act&#8217;s shortcomings are there for all to see. They have been played out in newspapers, on television, in committee meetings and, unfortunately, behind quickly closed doors.</p><p>The Scottish Police Authority has an important job to do, and the police service of Scotland has many vital roles to play in keeping our communities safe, but right now, the Government has the most important responsibility. It must ensure that the police set-up that it is creating is fit for purpose and that Scotland&#8217;s new police service is not constrained in being the police service that the people of Scotland deserve.</p><p>I do not believe that the Government intended ambiguous legislation and I would be happy to work constructively with it to make the legislation better. I therefore ask it to hold up its hands and say that it will look at the legislation again.</p><p>I am deeply disappointed that the Government&#8217;s amendment indicates that it thinks that everything is just hunky-dory. That is just burying its head in the sand. It needs to tighten up the legislation and get the show back on track.</p><p>I urge the Government to review urgently the scope of the Scottish Police Authority to ensure that it does exactly what was intended, and to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s new police force is able to get on with its important work.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the Police Service of Scotland ahead of its taking over all police functions on 1 April 2013; believes that, by taking control of policing out of the hands of locally elected members and transferring it to a board appointed by the Scottish Ministers, the Scottish Government has created a democratic deficit in Scotland&#8217;s police service; further believes that the Scottish Government&#8217;s complacent attitude toward its reform programme has allowed the Scottish Police Authority to effectively redefine the scope of its own remit; considers that decisions taken by the Scottish Police Authority on staffing, human resources and budgeting could put at risk the future operational effectiveness of policing in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to review as a matter of urgency whether the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 should be amended to provide clarity as to the rightful functions and responsibilities of the Scottish Police Authority and to report back to the Parliament before the end of June 2013.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686348", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Police Centralisation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At last Thursday&#8217;s First Minister&#8217;s question time, Alex Salmond asked me why we had not returned to the subject of police reform the week after we had first asked him about it in January.

We should use the opportunity of the procurement reform bill to ensure that public sector purchasing decisions do not support trade where goods or services are produced through the use of environmentally damaging methods or the exploitation of workers in poor countries. That purchasing power, which is worth around &#163;9 billion a year, should be used to support change around the world.</p><p>SCIAF has pointed out that unfair trade means that smallholder farmers still receive only a tiny proportion of the price that we pay for our food. Despite producing food for a third of the human race, the majority of the world&#8217;s hungry people are small-scale farmers; indeed, 80 per cent of the world&#8217;s undernourished people live in rural areas, the majority of them on small farms. Scotland has a good record in supporting fair trade&#8212;indeed, it has just become a fair-trade nation&#8212;and we must build on those foundations.</p><p>According to Oxfam&#8217;s briefing note to members, global citizenship education is about understanding the need to tackle injustice and inequality and having the desire and ability to work actively to do so. It is a way of thinking and behaving; it is an outlook on life and a belief that we can all make a difference.</p><p>Oxfam also supports the development education centres in Scotland that play such a vital role in providing professional support to teachers and youth workers and equipping them to deliver global citizenship education.</p><p>In my region in the north-east, the Montgomery development education centre in Aberdeen is doing sterling work.

As the SHRC explains, we have a fairly strong legal and institutional framework for human rights, but there are gaps in the realisation of those rights. The most important thing to strive for in developing the action plan is to ensure that it has relevance to people in the real world. Our human rights are not abstract; they are the basis for ensuring that, at every step in our lives, we are afforded the best possible opportunity, treatment and freedoms.</p><p>In the very short time that I have, I would like to talk briefly on two domestic applications of human rights on which we can and must do more. The first is the right to education. Education is vital to help people achieve their potential, but, for all the progress that we have made, too many youngsters still miss out. We must do more to ensure that disruptive and challenging children are not excluded from school. Why? Because we know what often happens to those who are excluded from and disenchanted with school: they end up entangled in the justice system.</p><p>I recently visited Polmont Young Offenders Institution and I have met a number of young offenders who take part in community justice schemes in the north-east. Sadly, the personal stories that I came across were all too familiar. Although the problem is not unique to Scotland, we have not done enough to find a workable solution. Children who are excluded from education at a young age&#8212;perhaps with behavioural or attention issues&#8212;often end up in court and in prison. Being in the justice system means that they miss out still more on the education that could make the difference to the path that they are taking. We must do everything in our power to ensure that no one misses out on the education that is rightfully theirs.</p><p>Secondly, I want to touch on the delivery of services to vulnerable and older people. In this instance, it is a question not of what care services are available&#8212;for the large part, they are efficient and fairly comprehensive&#8212;but of the quality of those services and, crucially, the manner in which they are delivered. Unfortunately, pressures can mean that care provision is driven solely by financial considerations.</p><p>Many members will be aware of the tragic case in Aberdeen of Ken Maitland, who had 106 different carers in a single year before his death last year. Clearly, that was unacceptable, but we can take practical and positive action to prevent such a situation from happening again.</p><p>Fundamentally, care provision, particularly for older and vulnerable people, must be focused on the individual. Being treated with respect and dignity is surely a fundamental right for anyone receiving care. We owe it to them to do more to ensure that that is a reality. The most marginalised and vulnerable in our society&#8212;some of the people whom I have mentioned in my examples&#8212;must be protected.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats have a strong and consistent record on human rights&#8212;the issue is at the very heart of our party. We have a strong record in government: in Scotland, Robert Brown was the minister who guided through Parliament the bill that established the Scottish Human Rights Commission; at Westminster, one of our first acts in government was to end child detention at Dungavel.</p><p>We are pleased to support the Government motion and the Labour amendment. We commend the excellent work of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, and we look forward to the development of the national action plan. The motion is right to be outward looking. Human rights are the concern of the whole world, and it is right that Scotland does what it can to support those rights on the wider stage.</p><p>However, I end on a note of caution. We cannot get complacent at home. Legislation is becoming more careless in its human rights implications, as we saw with legal aid and sectarianism. I encourage the Government to take time to reflect on its approach and ensure, first and foremost, that Scotland&#8217;s laws and actions set an example in being open, fair and free.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683467", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Rights"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Developing a national action plan for human rights is a welcome way of ensuring that the human rights that we assume that we have are, in practice, assured.

Although I acknowledge that there has been some movement on collections, I do not think that the compromise is enough. I see no good reason for us not to look to SLAB to collect all the contributions.</p><p>That is a relatively minor qualm compared with the concern about access to justice. Earlier today, I joined members of protest for justice outside the Parliament&#8212;legal professionals and members of the public who are concerned about the bill&#8217;s potential impacts on one of the central tenets of any democratic society: fair access to justice.</p><p>Reform of our legal system is nothing new. It has been put to me that many changes have been made to legal aid over the past 20 years, which have always been for the worse, but this is the first time that industrial action has been taken. The strength of feeling on the issue is not for show; it is real. The people at the heart of our legal profession&#8212;those who deal with accused persons day in, day out&#8212;are worried that the new law will fundamentally damage justice in Scotland. The issue is not, as the cabinet secretary has all too often asserted, about making criminals pay for their defence; it is about ensuring that all suspects&#8212;who are innocent until proven guilty&#8212;can, regardless of their circumstances, access proper legal help, advice and representation.</p><p>Since the stage 2 proceedings, the Government has been involved in fairly superficial negotiations with the Law Society and other representatives to seek a compromise. Once again, the Government&#8217;s casual and&#8212;at times, I think&#8212;bullying approach to law making has been shown up. Having been presented with the Government&#8217;s final, take-it-or-leave-it offer, the Law Society chose, pragmatically, to accept it, but it immediately sent out a briefing against the impact of the bill.</p><p>Although the Government might claim that its changes are protecting legal aid while ensuring that savings are made, that is simply not true. Even with the higher threshold, the effect of the changes will be to remove legal aid from a large chunk of working people.</p><p>Ann Ritchie, who is the president of the Glasgow Bar Association, shared with me examples of the sort of cases that she has dealt with in the past that the changes would have an impact on. The people concerned were working men and women with no previous convictions who were found not guilty. Had the proposed threshold been in place when they went to trial, they might not have been eligible for legal aid and might not have been able to afford the contribution. We could face the prospect of more people being forced to represent themselves in court, but without legal expertise they would lack the crucial tools to do so. We will risk sending more innocent people to jail, which would not be in the best interests of justice.</p><p>The truth is that we do not know how bad, ultimately, the impact of the changes will be, but we do know that the justice secretary is willing to risk irrevocably harming access to justice to cut a comparatively small amount from the legal aid budget, which can never be cash limited anyway. Once that precedent has been established, there is a risk that legal aid will be further eroded to make more savings.</p><p>Access to legal support is a fundamental necessity of a fair justice system. We accept the need for reform, but part 2 of the bill is a blunt instrument that will have far-reaching consequences for justice in Scotland, and the Liberal Democrats cannot support it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682806", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Had the establishment of a Scottish civil justice council been proposed on its own, we would have been glad to support it.

Support is provided through an holistic model of care, support and education. The approach seeks to provide mutual support and nurture independence, through living, learning and working together.</p><p>The movement was founded more than 70 years ago in Aberdeen by a group of Austrian refugees, many of whom had had to flee the country in 1939 because they were Jewish. They set up their first community in a rented manse, providing accommodation and food from the garden for the small group of children for whom they were caring. The men were interned as enemy aliens, but the women proceeded to purchase Camphill House on 1 June 1940, which is considered to be the birthday of the movement.</p><p>Today, Scotland is home to 12 Camphill communities, from the north-east and through the central belt to Dumfries and Galloway. Many Camphill communities are thriving social enterprises, selling home-made breads and cheeses and handicrafts, running cafes in the community or providing community composting facilities. Strong emphasis is placed on each individual achieving their potential and as much independence as they are able to achieve, to widen their opportunities when they make the move to long-term provision.</p><p>Camphill School Aberdeen is an independent day and residential school on the outskirts of Aberdeen. I have visited the school twice this year, and I was privileged to meet members of the pupil council and eco-committee. It was enlightening to talk to pupils. I congratulate the pupils on winning the green flag award&#8212;it is an elite few schools that win the gold award without first using the stepping stones of bronze and silver awards, and the green flag is a testament to the pupils&#8217; hard work.</p><p>I was also able to visit Simeon Care for the Elderly. When I visited, the home had 17 residents, the majority of whom were very elderly and frail. Some residents used to be in the community at Newton Dee and others are former co-workers, which demonstrates that Camphill can provide support at every stage of an individual&#8217;s life. The home is always full and there is a waiting list. Simeon Care is trying to raise &#163;3.5 million for a new home on the same site; it will also provide new outreach services to the other communities. So far, fundraising is going well, but there is quite a long way to go yet.</p><p>I am also acquainted with Newton Dee and its lovely cafe and bakery, so I have an insight into the range of services that Camphill provides. I was pleased to host a reception at lunch time and to meet people from the other communities round Scotland. I learned too much to fit it all into this speech, but I know that other members will highlight some of the good work that goes on in their areas. In that regard, Nigel Don expressed disappointment that he was unable to stay for this evening&#8217;s debate.</p><p>The different communities across Scotland are all united behind the same commitment to help every individual to achieve their potential and as much independence as they can. What has struck me most whenever I have visited is the complete positivity within each community. They are distinctive communities in which education and learning, appreciation of arts and music, concern for the land and the environment and the fostering of mutual respect and understanding combine to create happy and optimistic individuals who share life together in a calm and safe environment. Rather than seeing a difficulty or defining an individual by what they cannot do, Camphill has the determination to look for the positive to unlock each individual&#8217;s potential.</p><p>Independent scrutiny by the care inspectorate confirms that the communities are offering services of the highest quality. The particular strengths of Camphill, as assessed, lie in its creation of therapeutic environments and its particular staffing, management and leadership models, and that is borne out by the collaborative work that it does with the University of Aberdeen on a BA in social pedagogy.</p><p>What concerns me is the lack of recognition of the benefits of this approach by statutory authorities and the significant difficulties that parents, in particular, can face in securing funding from local authorities for residential care or education of this nature. Parents tell me that it can be such a battle, and is often only when things are at breaking point that funding is agreed. We should encourage a more co-operative approach, with local authorities supporting the best choice for each individual. It is surely wrong when an overinsistence on inclusion turns, in reality, into isolation and exclusion.</p><p>I quote a pupil&#8217;s words:</p><p>&#8220;Before I came to Camphill I wasn&#8217;t included in anything. I was pushed to the side, no one wanted to teach me. Teachers would ignore me if I asked questions and other pupils would pick on me. I chose to sit inside for lunch because I was afraid to go outside. I was accepted at Camphill, asked my opinion on things, and given the opportunity to do things such as going to college and also drama and art. I never thought I would be allowed to do these things and actually discovered that I was quite good at them!&#8221;</p><p>Here is a parent&#8217;s view:</p><p>&#8220;Jack&#8217;s life at Camphill has purpose. His daily routine builds into a complete year in which he feels secure and through this, his character is developing. His contribution is valued&#8212;he has self worth. While at Camphill he has grown into a person who we are proud of; he has achieved things we&#8217;d have never dreamed possible. He has learned to speak. We thank you for this. You are an extended family to us&#8212;not just for Jack&#8212;a lifeline that we will never forget nor take for granted.&#8221;</p><p>I urge local authorities and statutory services to consider taking a more person-centred approach to what is appropriate for any individual. I hope that this debate will help to do that, and I will be grateful if the minister, in his response, is able to support that call.</p><p>In closing, I pay tribute to the achievements of pupils and residents and to the dedication of staff, co-workers and volunteers in the Camphill movement. I hope that they will continue to flourish.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679632", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Camphill Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome members of Camphill communities from around Scotland who are in the public gallery this evening, and I thank fellow MSPs who supported my motion and enabled it to be debated tonight.

The police reforms are at a crucial stage and it is right that we seek to clarify a few basic issues&#8212;minor details such as who is in charge of what.</p><p>The whole chamber knows that the Liberal Democrats opposed the creation of a single force. Indeed, there has been some &#8220;creative tension&#8221; between the Government and ourselves. However, now that we are past the point of no return we want to do what we can to ensure that the new police service functions smoothly.</p><p>The new force begins operation in four months and, before it does, there is much that needs to happen. First, clearly, we must ensure that there is clarity about exactly what the Scottish Police Authority and the police service of Scotland are responsible for. Things have not got off to a good start in that respect. As a member of the Justice Committee, I witnessed first-hand the evidence of Vic Emery, the chair of the SPA, and Chief Constable House. They were at loggerheads with each other last week. It was one of the more open and frank evidence sessions and it provided an insight into the difficulties that are being faced in establishing the SPA and the police service of Scotland as working entities. It also highlighted the different interpretations of how the relationship between the two should work. Early days are meant for discussion, but it seems that the rushed legislation has left some rather large kinks to be ironed out.</p><p>As others have mentioned, the Government was good enough to share the detail of its position on a number of keys areas of dispute, which was welcome. The Liberal Democrats largely agree with its interpretation of the act, particularly where it places responsibility for the day-to-day running of the new service. However, I hope that the confusion may serve as a warning for the Government to take a little more time over future legislation.</p><p>At this point, it is vital that a resolution is reached. In opposition to the single force we often focused on the danger of political interference but, given the circumstances, it is right that the Government does what it can to help facilitate a resolution to the confusion that its new law has caused. If the best way forward is for the Government to set a deadline and make its position clear then, in this instance, that is important.</p><p>I find it interesting that, although the Government looks to keep the disagreement between the SPA and SPS chiefs at arm&#8217;s length, it is only too happy to wade chest deep into other matters&#8212;matters such as prescribing how the new chief constable will spend his budget.</p><p>I welcome the fact that there are more police officers in Scotland than ever before, but I cannot agree that an arbitrary number of officers determined by the Scottish National Party&#8217;s manifesto team is some holy grail of policing in Scotland. A fundamental tenet of the operational independence of the police is the ability of the chief constable to decide for himself or herself how the resources are best deployed to create a balanced workforce. Having a thousand extra police officers benefits no one unless they are free to get on with the role that they have been trained to do.</p><p>The number of civilian staff has fallen dramatically in recent years. It is not for me&#8212;or any of us in the chamber&#8212;to quantify precisely how many civilian staff our police need to employ, but the fact is that we have already lost more than 900 police staff in the past two years and we know that the brunt of the next round of cuts in the new service will disproportionately fall on those staff. Kenny MacAskill&#8217;s praise for their contribution will ring hollow; the many hundreds of police staff whose jobs are at risk will not find any comfort in the Government&#8217;s smugly-worded amendment.</p><p>If the Scottish Government is serious&#8212;as it should be&#8212;about refraining from political interference with the police and ensuring that operational independence is protected, then it should show that. It should ensure that the SPA and the police service of Scotland have clarity about the intent and extent of the reform act and then it should leave them to go on with the job and allow them to shape a modern police service that maximises the value of both staff and officers and removes the artificial distinctions that the SNP has nurtured.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679000", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Policing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Labour Party for bringing the debate to the Parliament this afternoon.

With a BAC of less than 0.05 per cent, the risk is reduced to being three times as great.</p><p>One of the greatest problems in addressing drink-driving is how hard the levels are to express in easy-to-understand terms. As many members have said, alcohol affects each of us differently. At the levels that we are talking about, the difference for most people from the change to 50mg would be not having a second pint of beer or having a smaller glass of wine. However, the difficulty comes when people judge how much they are affected. Many people do not feel noticeable effects even when they are past the point when they have become legally intoxicated.</p><p>In an ideal world, no one with alcohol in their system would get behind the wheel of a car. However, we must recognise that adhering to a zero-tolerance policy would in practice create serious technical and practical difficulties. While keeping our roads and the people who use them safe must be our primary concern, we must strike a fine balance.</p><p>Of course, setting the limit is not in itself the answer to reducing drink-driving. We must take a proactive approach in educating drivers of all ages, and particularly younger drivers, and in engaging with people to emphasise that putting themselves and others at risk by driving while drunk is unacceptable.</p><p>In the north-east last year, alcohol was a contributory factor in 206 road collisions&#8212;6 per cent of all accidents. However, it was a factor in as many as 25 per cent of all fatal accidents. This year, Grampian Police launched its mourning after campaign, to which Mark McDonald referred. That campaign is aimed directly at getting communities involved in reducing drink-driving locally. The hope is that the campaign will encourage people not just to report drink-drivers but to do what they can to prevent people from driving drunk in the first place. We need to encourage such an approach, as only so much can be achieved through action in Parliament.</p><p>In his opening speech, the cabinet secretary touched on the possibility of devolving further powers, particularly to set a stricter limit for young or newly qualified drivers. There is a growing evidence base on drink-driving among younger drivers, which other members have mentioned. The most prevalent counter-argument to that approach has been put forward by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which refers to</p><p>&#8220;a risk that young drivers who are subject to a lower drink drive limit may be more likely to drink and drive when they reached the age at which they became subject to the higher limit for other drivers because they thought that they could then &#8216;drink more and drive&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>I am more inclined to believe that, once young drivers are in the habit of not drinking before driving, they will be less likely to drink and drive as they get older. In any case, other countries&#8212;notably Ireland&#8212;have recently introduced a graduated limit, so it will be interesting to reflect on their evidence and experience. I would be happy to work with the Government in revisiting that aspect in the future.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats are content to offer our support for the motion. We look forward to the results of the Government&#8217;s consultation being published and to the reduced limit being introduced in Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drink-driving"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Let me make progress.

Part 1 will establish the Scottish civil justice council and part 2 will make changes to the current framework for criminal legal assistance. The Scottish Liberal Democrats can support the principle of the bill, although there are a number of areas in which we will seek improvements, as the bill progresses.</p><p>I will touch on the part 1 provisions only briefly&#8212;most of my comments relate to part 2. The proposal to set up a Scottish civil justice council arose from Lord Gill&#8217;s 2009 review of the Scottish civil courts. It is an entirely sensible suggestion; indeed, it is a necessary step if further recommendations from the Gill review are to be properly implemented. The council&#8217;s establishment should also ensure that the civil justice system is subjected to continuous improvement.</p><p>I welcome the Lord President&#8217;s assurance that although the council will not be an non-departmental public body, the appointment process will adhere to good-practice principles for public appointments&#8212;that is essential if we are to be confident in the new council&#8212;but Malcolm Chisholm is right to ask that that be enshrined in the bill.</p><p>Much of the evidence that we received in committee related to the proposed make-up of the council. As things stand, a majority of mandatory appointees will be members of the legal profession. As we have heard, the bill will give the Lord President discretion to appoint up to six additional members. From the outset, I would like the new council to include a fair balance of lay and legal representation. End users of the courts should have a clear voice. The Government has said that the bill strikes the right balance, but I ask the cabinet secretary to give further thought to guaranteeing that there will be such a balance among members of the council.</p><p>The Justice Committee recommended that lay members should not be precluded from being appointed to the role of deputy chair, and I welcome the Government&#8217;s indication that it will amend the bill to that effect.</p><p>Part 2 concerns criminal legal assistance. Although, in principle, the idea of recovering some costs for that is acceptable, the evidence to the committee has raised concerns about practicality. We must ask ourselves whether the financial savings that are likely to be made are proportionate to the risks and, indeed, the disbenefits that might arise.</p><p>I believe that access to justice and to fairness, and proportionality should underpin the new arrangements, but we have received a number of representations that, so far, the proposed arrangements do not live up to those criteria. Under the bill, anyone with disposable income of &#163;68 per week or more, or disposable capital of &#163;750 or more, will have to pay a contribution towards ABWOR or criminal legal aid. There is genuine concern that those thresholds are too low and will result in poor and vulnerable people having to pay contributions.</p><p>At this stage, it is difficult to bring anything fresh to the debate, but there is an issue on which I think no one has touched. The details of the charging will be set out in regulations and in SLAB&#8217;s scheme of eligibility. The Justice Committee agreed with the Subordinate Legislation Committee&#8217;s view that that power is a significant one, and that there is no good reason why it should not be exercised through an instrument that is subject to the affirmative procedure. The Government gave its response to that in Mr MacAskill&#8217;s letter to the Justice Committee. He said:</p><p>&#8220;The scheme will provide direction to solicitors granting ABWOR on how to apply the undue hardship test ... It is not considered that once the scheme is initially approved and published that it would be a static document. As the scheme is concerned with what constitutes undue hardship for a client, or the dependents of a client, it is important that the scheme can be flexible and responsive to emerging needs. I therefore envisage that the scheme would be a &#8216;living document&#8217; and one which the Board would keep under constant review ... I expect that Scottish Ministers&#8217; clearance of any revisals to the scheme could be obtained in most cases in just a few days. If the scheme were contained in a statutory instrument we could find ourselves in a situation where necessary, and perhaps urgent, changes are required but a Parliamentary process must be followed which prevents quick dissemination of the change.&#8221;</p><p>That response causes me real concern and sets alarm bells ringing. Of course we want the scheme to be flexible, but we do not want the Government to be making it up as it goes along. I do not believe that the detail has been properly worked through or that sufficient time has been taken to define &#8220;undue hardship&#8221;, and there is nothing to guard against the contributory net being cast ever wider to catch more and more people in it. That adds to my belief that members of Parliament must be able to scrutinise the regulations, which must be subject to parliamentary process. I urge the cabinet secretary to reconsider his stance on that.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s movement on disregarding disability living allowance and, in time, the PIP is welcome, but it is not the end of the story. The cabinet secretary must continue to work with Capability Scotland to find an appropriate and balanced way of calculating disability-related expenditure. We need the outcome of that before the bill completes its progress through Parliament.</p><p>Section 17 will enable ministers to disapply the requirement to obtain contributions from people who are held in police custody. The Government has said that it intends</p><p>&#8220;to discuss potential to use this provision with the Law Society&#8221;.</p><p>I would welcome more clarity on that.</p><p>Concern is widespread in the legal profession that collecting summary legal aid contributions will be difficult for firms and could lead them to have to write off a proportion of their income. Such a requirement could have unintended consequences for the functioning of the summary criminal justice system and could lead to adjournments and delays, as we have heard. For that reason, I am inclined to think that SLAB is better placed to collect such contributions. I urge the Government to revisit the issue at stage 2.</p><p>We support the bill&#8217;s principles, but with a number of caveats. I hope that the Government will reflect on the many concerns that all members have raised today and will lodge amendments at stage 2 that address those concerns. The cabinet secretary must ensure that access to justice, fairness and proportionality are at the heart of his proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675001", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Civil Justice Council and Criminal Legal Assistance Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we know&#8212;it has been said many times during the debate&#8212;the bill is in two distinct parts.

Any liberal society must walk a fine line between allowing free and open reporting of criminal proceedings and ensuring that the right to a fair trial is in no way compromised. With the growing prevalence of social media and 24-hour news channels, the first of those aims is flourishing while the second is increasingly threatened.</p><p>I emphasise that I hope and believe that no media outlet in Scotland would ever intentionally seek to compromise criminal proceedings for the sake of a story. Yet with increasing and, particularly in the case of Twitter, instant access to various details about on-going criminal cases, there is a greater risk of unfiltered information entering into the public domain, of the publishing of partial facts, or of skewed or prejudiced perspectives&#8212;any one of which has the potential to influence proceedings.</p><p>A particular concern in this regard, which was raised by many of the experts we heard from in committee, is about the role of jurors in the information age. The question of how the changing manner in which information from court cases is disseminated to the public&#8212;and so often into the hands of those involved in deciding the case&#8212;should impact on how the justice system works is far from straightforward.</p><p>In committee, we heard suggestions ranging from the rewriting of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 to a move to a system of professional juries. I would be interested to know whether the minister is considering the media&#8217;s impact on jury trials as part of the Government&#8217;s wider reforms of the Scottish justice system.</p><p>I am sure that much of the focus of the debate, particularly in the press, will be on the on-going discussions about the presence of TV cameras in courtrooms, which is what we have mostly discussed this afternoon. That is not least because of the Lord President&#8217;s announcement last week that current policy is to be reviewed.</p><p>Cameras have been permitted to film in Scotland&#8217;s courts only on the rarest of occasions. The amount of press attention that the decision to allow coverage of the Gilroy sentencing attracted is testimony to its unusualness.</p><p>The arguments in favour of greater TV coverage&#8212;that there would be greater transparency in the legal process, which is an inherently Liberal Democratic view, and that justice would be shown to be done, which is perhaps not so much an inherently Liberal Democratic view&#8212;are well rehearsed. Greater transparency and more open access to our justice system can only be a good thing.</p><p>For lay people who come into contact with the courts for the first time, the experience can be intimidating. I hope that I will not offend anyone in the chamber with this observation, but lawyers and judges can oftentimes seem to go out of their way to confuse, not least by the use of jargon and Latin terms. I do not intend to spend the day making the case for the use of plain English in courts&#8212;although that case might be worth making&#8212;but people should have the right to understand how the legal system works. They can be reassured that it works and works fairly only through that understanding, and the system will become less intimidating only through that understanding. Opening up court proceedings and letting more people see what takes place in the courtroom appears to be a prime way of achieving that aim.</p><p>The Government will soon publish its victims and witnesses bill. Protecting witnesses and victims must remain a primary concern whenever we talk about media coverage of the courts. That is one of the key arguments against greater media access. Even attending court can be a daunting experience for those concerned, and the presence of television cameras is unlikely to make things easier. Donald Findlay QC was particularly clear on that point. He argued that broadcasting a criminal trial</p><p>&#8220;would put pressure on witnesses, and it is difficult enough to get people to come forward.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 2 October 2012; c 1781.]</p><p>That is a legitimate concern.</p><p>Mr Findlay also fairly made a point that is often overlooked: what of the accused who is subsequently found not guilty? Other members have said that it would perhaps be unfair for them to return to their lives having spent a fortnight being publicly and professionally accused of committing a crime that their peers subsequently determined that they did not commit. Does that not risk the public prejudging and endangering the fundamental principle of being innocent until proven guilty?</p><p>There are also practical concerns. Broadcasting an entire trial is one thing, but if there are cameras in the courtroom, it is inevitable that an edited highlights reel of the day&#8217;s proceedings will find its way on to the evening news. Having a reporter presenting a balanced summary is one thing, but whether it is possible to edit five or six hours of footage into a two-minute report without creating a narrative is quite another matter.</p><p>Others have referred to OJ Simpson effect. The last thing that we want is a media circus around criminal trials. That would favour no one. It would not favour the accused, the victim, the witnesses, the jury or, ultimately and most important, justice itself.</p><p>Despite those problems, I still find myself drawn to the position that we ought to allow greater access to our justice system. It is a fact that the justice process seems closed off and mysterious to outsiders. It is not as open and transparent as it could or should be. It is not as simple as telling the TV companies to go ahead and start filming, but it is clear that we should give greater consideration to the matter.</p><p>In our committee evidence session, Steve Raeburn of The Firm magazine drew an interesting parallel. He said that the BBC Parliament channel</p><p>&#8220;is an example to follow ... It runs debates as often as Parliament sits, late into the night, probably to a limited audience but to a dedicated audience that is interested. It is our Parliament and we are entitled to see it.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 2 October 2012; c 1787.]</p><p>I wonder whether the principle is not the same. Of course, many issues must be addressed first and balances need to be struck, but is it not still our justice system and should we not be entitled to see it in action?</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of the Media in Criminal Trials"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is clear from this afternoon&#8217;s debate that the issue of how the media interact with criminal trials is extremely complex.

Turning over power to those at the local level is a fundamental aim of our party, and we look forward to working constructively with the Government once the consultation is over and the bill has been introduced.</p><p>It is difficult to talk about community empowerment without referring to the work of the Christie commission, and the minister has already done that. We are fortunate that we have such a wide-ranging and comprehensive blueprint for the future delivery of public services, but the ethos of the commission&#8217;s report goes beyond public services. It is, at its heart, about putting communities first. Christie stated:</p><p>&#8220;effective services must be designed with and for people and communities - not delivered &#8216;top down&#8217;&#8221;.</p><p>I believe that that holds true across Government. Wherever possible, we in the Parliament should not dictate to communities, but rather give them the tools to tailor their own solutions.</p><p>Our home rule commission is to some extent building on Christie&#8217;s work. We are expanding it far further and looking at our overall vision for a strong Scotland within the United Kingdom, but its basis is about giving communities the power to set their own agenda and take back control of the things that are important to them.</p><p>There are a number of interesting possibilities&#8212;too many to discuss them all in full today&#8212;for how we might translate the goal of community empowerment into the reality of action in Scotland. I encourage as many people as possible to consider what they and their communities would like to become part of the bill. I particularly commend to the minister the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce&#8217;s citizen power project and, more generally, the work of the Carnegie Trust and Nesta, and I urge him to draw on their research. At a local level, there is much good practice in Aberdeenshire, in my region, and a range of rural partnerships and community trusts is already in place.</p><p>One idea that is mooted in the consultation&#8212;it is already in place with some success in England and Wales&#8212;is to give communities the power to take over key local assets. That might be in the shape of community centres or parks, or perhaps something more fundamental such as social housing. We should think of that not as asset transfer but as asset exchange&#8212;something that allows communities to weave together the latent assets in individuals and organisations for the benefit of the whole community.</p><p>However, we must guard against trying to graft good ideas on to problematic structures, so we need to take time to get the framework right. It will take a significant culture change to make public services more human scale&#8212;Chic Brodie mentioned that&#8212;and to localise economic power as well as political power.</p><p>Occasionally, we already see community groups saving failing public amenities, but we might look to expand that further. One option is to give communities the power to come together formally and take control of a raft of services from local authorities. That might, for example, allow them to take control of all their recreational or social care facilities and receive an appropriate proportion of the council&#8217;s budget as funds, be that from council tax, business rates or whatever. They would have full control over how the money was spent, along with legal recognition of their role.</p><p>However, the key has to be flexibility. Rather than we in the Parliament determining what role communities should take, we should put in place a framework that allows them to determine that for themselves. What works for one community will not necessarily work for all. It is essential that all communities benefit, not only those that currently have the capacity to take action. Sarah Boyack was right to point to the SCVO&#8217;s representations on that point.</p><p>The bill provides an opportunity for us to look at the way in which planning works at a local level. Margaret Mitchell touched on that. One of the main weaknesses in our planning system is the tension that is created between residents and council planning committees&#8212;a tension that is unlikely to be resolved simply by passing planning control further down the line. I would be interested to know what consideration the minister has given to how the bill could resolve that, whether through a greater role in the process for community organisations or perhaps through a fairer method of ensuring that the financial benefits of developments are kept in the community.</p><p>We have an ageing population&#8212;we never stop talking about that in the Parliament&#8212;yet society increasingly devalues older people and many older people feel overinstitutionalised and disengaged from society. The bill represents an opportunity to develop more inclusive and innovative solutions to improve older people&#8217;s lives.</p><p>Those are just a few possibilities. I hope that, when the consultation responses are published, we will see a fuller picture of how people throughout Scotland believe that local decision making can better work for them. The trick will then be to ensure that ministers listen to what respondents say is important to them. No doubt that will be a big challenge.</p><p>The bill will be an important one. It is a real test of where the Government&#8217;s and indeed the Parliament&#8217;s intentions lie&#8212;in localism or in centralisation. I firmly believe in localism, so I want to be able to work constructively on the bill. I cannot help being concerned for its final form, because the Government has just pressed ahead with one of the biggest centralisation programmes that the Parliament has seen, but I live in hope.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Liberal Democrats welcome the consultation on the proposed community empowerment and renewal bill.

In particular, I was dismayed that the Peacock project was a casualty of the process. However, I accepted that the city council took the decision to move forward to the design stage&#8212;in fact, the design competition took the debate forward and opened people&#8217;s eyes to the possibilities.</p><p>The decision to hold a referendum reassured people that everyone&#8217;s views would be taken into account. There was a clear result in the referendum, which should have established the project in principle, but the new Labour administration has pulled the plug on it. The challenge now is not to keep harking back, but to find a way out of the mess.</p><p>I am dismayed that Aberdeen is now known as the Disney of the North: it disnae want this, and it disnae want that. In fact, the biggest worry is that it disnae know what it does want. All the indications so far show that the Labour administration has no coherent vision for the city. Rather than starting out by commanding trust and commitment, it has embarked on a road of confrontation and imposition, and that is not how modern councils should operate.</p><p>I agree that, as Kevin Stewart&#8217;s motion asserts,</p><p>&#8220;Aberdeen city centre needs transformational change.&#8221;</p><p>As the energy capital, Aberdeen powers the economy of the region and well beyond, and we must recognise that change is needed to maintain that prosperity. If our region is to remain competitive, our city centre must compare well with other European cities. Aberdeen would benefit from having a more vibrant city centre, and research has demonstrated that that is a key component of competitive regions. Some very poor planning decisions over the years have changed the way in which the city centre is used. The shopping centre areas are now quite disconnected, and the main thoroughfare of Union Street is in enormous terminal decline.</p><p>Nanette Milne spoke about Aberdeen city and shire economic future, which is a public-private partnership that brings together councils, Scottish Enterprise, the local chamber of commerce, Skills Development Scotland, VisitScotland and representatives from business and academia. It was set up to bring a collaborative approach to growing the economy and enhancing the quality of life in the region, and it has been an exemplar for other regions in Scotland. Its vision of a region that has</p><p>&#8220;one of the most robust and resilient economies in Europe with a reputation for opportunity, enterprise and inventiveness that will attract and retain world-class talent of all ages&#8221;</p><p>is surely one that we can all share.</p><p>However, I heard this summer that there is a question mark hanging over the city council&#8217;s on-going participation in ACSEF. Such insularity will not serve the city well, and I urge the city leaders to think again.</p><p>There are many good reasons to locate business in Aberdeen, but there are growing disincentives such as the lack of an integrated transport network and a vibrant city centre. Although we can look to the Government to tackle the first issue, we must rely on the local council to drive forward the latter. I urge the city council to put engagement and openness at the heart of how it does business from here on in, and to think big for our city.</p><p>Kevin Stewart talked about 19th century architects. Perhaps the council could learn from the words of Daniel Burnham, an American architect and urban planner who played a leading role in the master planning of Chicago and Washington DC a century ago.

At every step of the way, the cabinet secretary has sought to marginalise the legitimate concerns raised by others.</p><p>What of the things that we risk losing? A modern police officer&#8217;s role is about more than working to reduce crime. It is just as much about reducing the fear of crime and working in partnership with communities to make a real difference and improve quality of life for everyone. Our constables help at midnight football leagues, discuss concerns with community councils, and they talk with young drivers about staying safe on the roads. It is about officers of every rank instilling confidence, building up relationships and trust with local communities, and it is about the senior ranks keeping in day-to-day contact with our community planning partners: social services, court services, councils and health boards.</p><p>Our excellent emergency services&#8217; successes over the past decades&#8212;the reduction in crime that the cabinet secretary spoke about, safer communities and fewer house fires&#8212;have been achieved because those services are funded, managed and delivered locally. They are accountable to local people, they are responsive to local needs and they can prioritise and adapt based on local circumstances.</p><p>The Government has tried to answer those concerns through the idea of local commanders and local policing plans, but it has consistently rejected measures put forward by opposition parties to give local authorities some control and some substantive input into those plans. Indeed, the Government&#8217;s announcement last week of the proposed area commands is further proof that it just does not get it.</p><p>Not only are the areas unwieldy, but they will serve to further remove local authorities from decision making on policing in their regions. For local voices to be heard, councils will have to go through a local commander, an area commander and the chief constable to the police authority. Not even this Government can spin that as being local accountability.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats are not against reforming our emergency services. We fully accept that there is a need to modernise and that there is a need to make greater efficiency savings. However, this bill and these reforms are not about those needs. They are about the Government&#8217;s centralisation agenda&#8212;about taking power away from local communities and putting it in the hands of ministers.

We all recognise that recovery from drug addiction is possible. We need to develop end-to-end support for people who face drug and alcohol problems by building closer links between community, in-patient and residential treatment and rehabilitation providers. Crucially, there must be close working between addiction services and aftercare providers so that individuals are not cast adrift when their treatment ends. Scottish Liberal Democrats believe that local people know best, and we would give local areas and organisations, including family support groups, the freedom to design and jointly commission drug and alcohol services to ensure that they meet local needs.</p><p>On-going support in the community is essential for the recovery journey and often includes mutual aid and other peer support. Those who have conquered their own addictions can contribute a huge amount of experience and support to those who are still battling addiction. We would like to see those who are in recovery being given the opportunity to give something back. We think that there would be a significant benefit in there being local networks of recovery champions. Such peer networks would involve those who are in recovery mentoring and providing support to individuals who are making their way through the recovery process.</p><p>We would like the Government to encourage local areas to develop and promote a whole-family approach to the delivery of recovery services, and to consider greater provision of support services for families and carers in their own right. That is where the work of the Grampian Families Support Forum can lead the way. The forum works closely with Scottish Families Affected by Drugs, which estimates that 24,000 family members are affected by loved ones&#8217; drugs misuse in the Grampian region alone. Our families are, in so many circumstances, the lifeline that we rely on when we face difficulties. The particular tensions that drugs misuse brings to families can stretch that lifeline to breaking point, but there are still many barriers that prevent family members from seeking support for themselves, so the primary challenge is in breaking down those barriers.</p><p>Learning to cope with a loved one&#8217;s dependency, finding space to take care of oneself and the rest of the family, and overcoming the stigma that is associated with drug misuse, which other members have spoken about, can be overwhelmingly difficult. That is why support for families is vital and should not be an afterthought. I have no doubt that mutual support from local people with first-hand experience can be an immense support. There is much that we can learn from the Grampian Family Support Forum, and I hope that other parts of Scotland will benefit from their experience.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank the Conservatives for using their debating time this morning to highlight the role of families who are in recovery from drug abuse and&#8212;in particular&#8212;to highlight the work of the Grampian Family Support Forum.

In passing, I remark that I am surprised that there were no briefings from any of the unions or the STUC.</p><p>In 2012, why is it that to have children or to become a carer means inequality for women? Flexible working is not available in all types of work, including senior roles. Why is it that pregnancy discrimination, sexual harassment and other forms of workplace discrimination are not eliminated? Until we transform Scotland&#8217;s workplaces, women&#8217;s choices will remain limited. Men and women will not be able to lead family life in a way that works for them, older women will continue to be less independent than men, and our country will become less productive in a tougher global economy. Women are still undervalued and underpaid. I am particularly concerned about the apparent erosion of terms and conditions of those who are employed as carers, as councils continue to outsource provision of personal care for the elderly.</p><p>I urge the committee to look at the matter of women and work in the round. Topics for consideration should include occupational segregation, the modern apprentice programme and gender stereotyping generally in employment, vocational training and skills training, and how that reinforces occupational segregation throughout someone&#8217;s lifetime in employment.</p><p>As others have said, the issues of work-life balance and unpaid labour in care provision, which falls on women&#8217;s shoulders, should be considered. Access to childcare services, their affordability and their long-term stability are also issues. Another issue is the loss of employment opportunities for women as a result of the increase in part-time working by men. The Royal Society of Edinburgh&#8217;s recent report examines in great depth the lack of retention and progression of women in science, engineering and technology jobs. There is also a need to target women&#8217;s entrepreneurship and self-employment.</p><p>As members will know, I have always taken a keen interest in women in science, so I will focus on that subject in my last few comments. It is such a waste that 73 per cent of women with qualifications in SET subjects no longer work in those areas. There is no magic solution, but a consistent and pragmatic approach is needed to nurture young women scientists. The Scottish resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology, which is based at Edinburgh Napier University, is tackling many of those issues, but much more can be done.</p><p>The Athena SWAN project aims to increase the number of women recruited to top academic posts in science. By working with universities on staff development, mentoring and networking schemes for women, Athena is helping to embed best practice in science departments. I urge the Government to encourage all universities to take part in the project. It is extremely disheartening that only a few universities have so far shown an interest in Athena, which is a proven way forward.</p><p>A complex web of interactions is having a negative impact on the retention and advancement of women in the SET sector. Barriers relate to organisational culture, mobility, long working hours, returning to work after a career break and the widespread use of fixed-term contracts. Those all contribute to the leaky pipeline in science that we have heard about.</p><p>A change in workplace policies and practices is required to reduce attrition levels at all levels of scientific, engineering and technology-related employment. Whole workplace cultures need to change to make them fair places to work for everyone. We should create workplaces in which it is acknowledged that family life is at least as important as working life and in which every individual can progress to attain their full potential.</p><p>Mary Fee mentioned last week&#8217;s debate on women on boards.

The older I get, the more impatient I am&#8212;not for myself, but for the next generation of women. The pace of change is glacial.</p><p>No one who takes even a cursory look at our Parliament, our council chambers, our boardrooms and our public bodies will be able to argue that Scotland has got it right. Although Scotland is a really diverse country, that diversity is not reflected in those institutions. We are short-changing everyone, not just those who are underrepresented. Our public bodies guide a range of very important services and if we are to properly meet the needs of our diverse population we should be able to draw on the full potential of all our citizens and value their individuality. Board membership should be broadly representative of our wider society.</p><p>For many years, I have reluctantly accepted the argument that soft measures such as mentoring, education, awareness, improved access to child care and so on are the way forward. The diversity delivers strategy, which was drawn up in 2008, seemed to be a reasonable attempt at improving equality in public appointments and I welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to tackle the matter. The vision had three strands: first, a pool of applicants as diverse as the people of Scotland; secondly, an appointments system that inspired confidence; and, thirdly, a programme of support for our future leaders. Has it worked? The latest annual report from the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland says:</p><p>&#8220;The outcomes by equality group offer a mixed picture. It is encouraging to see increases in the percentage of female applicants, ... demonstrating that the awareness-raising activity undertaken as part of Diversity Delivers has made an impact. However, it is frustrating to see the decrease in the percentage of women and applicants declaring a disability who are shortlisted and to note the decline in the appointment figures.&#8221;</p><p>Indeed, back in 2008, the &#8220;Diversity Delivers&#8221; document, while arguing against the need for targets, warned that</p><p>&#8220;a strategy that results in more diversity at the application stage&#8212;but sees no change on the boards themselves&#8212;will not have succeeded.&#8221;</p><p>By its own measurement, the strategy is not delivering on the vision.</p><p>As I said, our boards perform important functions and in no way do I undervalue the commitment and service of those who currently serve on them. I am not criticising any individual male on any board, but it is time to scotch, once and for all, the old argument that keeps getting trotted out: that positive discrimination leads to mediocrity.</p><p>More women are applying but men keep getting the jobs. Do we really believe that that is because men are always the outstanding candidates? Are our boards around Scotland just fizzing with innovation, enterprise and erudition, or is it the case that perfectly acceptable, well-qualified men are displacing equally acceptable, well-qualified women? Maybe it is even worse than that&#8212;what if it is the case that perfectly acceptable men are displacing some very bright women?</p><p>Are all MSPs happy that their daughters and granddaughters should continue to be at such a disadvantage? Are they happy to accept that 52 per cent of Scots do not deserve proper representation? Are they happy to continue to give a special advantage to men and to be blind to the fact that ability comes wrapped in many guises? Is it not time that we made a step change? Is it not time to face up to the fact that some extremely difficult-to-conquer biases are operating under the radar?</p><p>Around Europe, there is a growing realisation that soft measures are not working, and here in Scotland we need to be open-minded enough to consider introducing the measures that are working elsewhere.

Often&#8212;perhaps too often&#8212;when we look at the justice system and justice issues in the context of reform, it is easy to forget that crime is not simply a collection of statistics. Rather, it is the story of people whose lives have been adversely affected through the actions of others. We must remember that, and do all that we can to provide the support and protection that those people deserve.</p><p>Although we are fortunate that we have in Victim Support a solid service that people in Scotland can access, we should not be complacent. Ultimately, Victim Support and other charities like it comprise volunteers and can work only within the bounds of the laws and the legal framework that we have in place. It is therefore vital that we ensure that those laws offer victims and witnesses the best possible protection in order that support organisations can be at their most effective.</p><p>As a party, we have put forward a range of measures that are designed to improve the situation for victims of crime in Scotland, and we hope that the Government will be able to take them on board in shaping the forthcoming bill. They include relatively straightforward measures such as reducing the amount of time that is taken to resolve summary cases, and more innovative thinking that involves looking at the experience of victims at each stage of the justice process.</p><p>That begins with the vital issue of support. Part of our wide-ranging vision for justice reform involves increasing the amount of paid work that takes place in prisons. Through that, we would like a means to be developed that would allow a contribution to be taken from prisoners&#8217; wages to be used to help to provide additional funding for victim support measures. We believe that that would provide a more constructive approach than the consultation&#8217;s proposal for a surcharge to be applied, and it would re-emphasise the idea of offenders making reparations over the course of their sentence.</p><p>We would like more action to be taken to ensure that the experience of court for victims and witnesses is improved. That should start with moves to ensure that they are not harassed and intimidated by the accused or the accused&#8217;s family while in court. We recognise that there can be practical difficulties in ensuring that victims and witnesses do not have to mix with the accused&#8217;s family or friends, but that is an area in which more needs to be done. I would welcome moves to improve the type of information that is made available to those attending court, particularly information that makes sentencing easier to understand.</p><p>Members on the Justice Committee have been scrutinising the Criminal Cases (Punishment and Review) (Scotland) Bill, and our evidence taking has highlighted just how confusing sentencing in Scotland is. Although I do not agree with the Conservatives that ending automatic early release is the best way to stand up for the rights of victims, that would certainly make the process fairer and more comprehensible.</p><p>Moving beyond the support that can be offered, we would like changes to be made to how the compensation system works. However, our concern is less about the priority given to collection that is discussed in the consultation and more about the policy.</p><p>We do not believe that the existing system, wherein it is incumbent on the victim to recover from the offender any compensation that the courts have awarded them, is right. Rather, we believe that when a victim of crime is awarded compensation, either through a compensation offer or a court order, they should receive payment directly from the state. It would be up to the state to pursue repayment from the offender through the work of fine enforcement officers.</p><p>Finally, we would like the existing victim notification scheme to be widened, so that victims are told when the person who committed the offence against them is eligible for release from prison or when&#8212;these circumstances are rare&#8212;they are unlawfully at large.</p><p>We believe that those proposals are key steps in the right direction and that they are a move towards making the justice system less intimidating, and the process of going through it less of an ordeal, for victims and witnesses of crime in Scotland.</p><p>However, it is important to note that although improvements can be made through a victims&#8217; and witnesses&#8217; rights bill, many aspects that need to be addressed cannot be addressed in isolation. Audit Scotland&#8217;s recent report, &#8220;An overview of Scotland&#8217;s criminal justice system&#8221;, highlighted that inefficiencies in processing cases cost the criminal justice system at least &#163;10&#160;million in 2009-10. Furthermore, repeated delays in processing cases can have a negative effect on people&#8217;s confidence in the system and an adverse impact on the health of witnesses and victims.</p><p>Therefore, we should consider the Government&#8217;s consultation alongside our entire justice system reform programme. Compensation should be looked at at the same time as reforms to our prison system are planned, making the experience for victims and witnesses better in court should be considered when decisions are made on whether local courthouses should be retained, and the needs of vulnerable victims and witnesses at every stage of prosecution should be viewed in the wider context of the making justice work reform programme.</p><p>If we are to reshape Scotland&#8217;s justice system successfully, we must put victims front and centre every step of the way. As others have said, no one chooses to be a victim of crime or a witness. The justice system must serve and protect such people, and we must ensure that our work is shaped around them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Improving Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I welcome today&#8217;s debate and the consultation, although I am disappointed that we have had to wait a year for the Government to move ahead with this much-needed work.

The standing orders that were adopted in the first session of the Parliament largely achieved that.</p><p>I am glad that our Parliament is a business-like one that is not hung up on archaic procedures. Standing orders have served us well and we have achieved a great deal in the formative years of the Parliament. However, no one should expect everything to stay the same as the day it was set up. It is right therefore to reflect on and review our modus operandi. Our parliamentary procedures should evolve in response to our changing role and public expectations.</p><p>As the Parliament matures, the Scottish people increasingly look to us to respond quickly to emerging concerns, but there is a sense that the current shape of the parliamentary week restricts our ability to respond as swiftly as we would like. I congratulate the Presiding Officer on her determination to make this parliamentary session the time for procedural reform. She has been resolute in that. We have already benefited from some changes that were within her remit to make, such as more time for questions from back benchers, longer speaking slots in debates, and so on.</p><p>Today we are considering what changes are required to standing orders to enable us to reform the parliamentary week. I thank the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee for the research that it has done for its report. It has helped us to see ourselves as others see us and has set out a well-reasoned case for reform of the parliamentary week. Scottish Liberal Democrats support the proposed changes and I am glad to note that there is cross-party support for them.</p><p>I do not doubt that the proposals will have an impact on MSPs. As elected representatives, we have a number of roles, and the challenge for us all is to strike the proper balance between constituency and parliamentary work. I am content that the proposals that we are considering today keep things in reasonable balance, but I welcome the indication that the matter will be kept under review.</p><p>We do need to monitor the impact on committee work. We need to ensure that committees do not feel squeezed. The proposals will limit the opportunity for committees to sit for a whole day, although in practice few currently do so, given that a number of members sit on more than one committee on the same day. With a little adjustment of start times, committees should have sufficient time to tackle their business. However, the proposals could further restrict the ability of committees to take their work outside the Parliament. In the early days, there was a hope that the Parliament would take its meetings beyond Edinburgh, and be active in communities across Scotland. That has not happened as much as I would have liked, so perhaps further consideration could be given to that.</p><p>Our Parliament has no revising chamber and our committees were intended to have a key role in scrutinising and amending legislation. They have a patchy record in doing that and we need to look again at that in the light of the changing circumstances relating to the majority Government that we have at the moment. We should not be afraid to question how effective our committees can now be. I hope that that will be the focus of further work by the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee and others.</p><p>A key role for MSPs is to scrutinise the Scottish Government&#8217;s work. The Parliament needs to have the time and opportunity to do so regularly. Current question times are rigid and, as members have said, there is a long run-in time for the lodging of questions, which makes them far from topical. Extending the plenary sessions as suggested into a Tuesday afternoon will provide a welcome opportunity for more frequent questioning, especially on developing issues.</p><p>The proposal to have topical questions on Tuesday, portfolio questions on Wednesday and general questions along with First Minister&#8217;s questions on Thursday will give MSPs a much better range of opportunities to scrutinise the Government and to explore issues of concern. If, as anticipated, the Presiding Officer selects a maximum of one or two topical questions per week, that will give the member who asks the question, and other members who are trying to follow through, plenty of scope for in-depth questioning of ministers. That is an important reform. The reduction in lead-in time for questions will engender more topicality.</p><p>The Parliament was set up to be as family friendly as possible, in recognition of the fact that we have other commitments as parents, carers, partners or whatever. A modern Parliament should strive for that healthy balance, which is why I am pleased that we have not opted for a blanket extension to sitting hours into the evenings on a Wednesday. For some of us who travel down from the north, a blanket extension would make no difference, as we are away from our families for at least three days a week anyway but, for those who can travel home of an evening, I wish to protect that ability and ensure that they can continue to travel home at a reasonable hour that allows for some family time.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parliamentary Reform (Changes to Standing Orders)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I ask colleagues to excuse my voice; I have a bad throat today.

Their work is invaluable.</p><p>Good management of epilepsy is important, and that is where epilepsy specialist nurses can really help. They work alongside and complement the consultant. New patients can be seen promptly. Nurse-led review clinics offer one-to-one support that I know is really valued, especially at the outset after a diagnosis of epilepsy. Specialist nurses assist with and improve the transition from child to adult care&#8212;the cross-party group has talked about that a lot and about how much still needs to be done. Specialist nurses also provide better epilepsy management and develop good links with individual patients, offering them and their carers co-ordinated help. They do all that in a real value-for-money way. Each ESN costs the health service around &#163;40,000 and can care for around 250 people.</p><p>As those of us who are involved in the cross-party group on epilepsy know, the provision of ESNs is patchy at best. Last week, Epilepsy Scotland provided the group with updated figures. Within my own region, NHS Grampian and NHS Tayside have some provision but I do not doubt that much more could be done. I hope that the minister will address that point in his closing speech.</p><p>Earlier this year, I visited the Quarriers epilepsy fieldworkers office in the north-east to learn about the work that they carry out across Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire. I was really impressed with the range of support that they offer and the wealth of experience and expertise that they bring to people who have epilepsy, their families and carers and to other health professionals.</p><p>The theme of this week&#8217;s national epilepsy week is &#8220;celebrating achievement&#8221;. Newspapers and other media have certainly played their part, and I congratulate The Guardian in particular on its supplement on epilepsy earlier this week.</p><p>Raising awareness of epilepsy and the needs of those with the condition is a key part of ensuring that everyone can reach their potential. The biggest risk to young people with epilepsy is a lack of understanding, and we must ensure that they are not unnecessarily excluded from activities as they grow up.</p><p>I was disappointed to note the fresh research that Young Epilepsy published this week. It reveals that many young people are stigmatised and that their health and wellbeing are put at risk because others have a poor knowledge and understanding of their condition. David Ford, Young Epilepsy&#8217;s chief executive, said:</p><p>&#8220;A major shift in awareness and understanding is the only thing that is going to improve this situation. We know that young people with epilepsy are getting a raw deal when it comes to education, employment and social interaction&#8221;.</p><p>That is not good enough in Scotland today, and we must all challenge it&#8212;not just this week, but all year round.</p><p>It is particularly important that our young people are supported both in schools and in leisure activities. The involvement of epilepsy champions is a great way of providing role models for young people who might just be coming to terms with a diagnosis of epilepsy.</p><p>On that note, it is fitting that I close with a quote from Commonwealth, European and world champion 400m hurdler Dai Greene. He was diagnosed with epilepsy as a teenager and has pledged his support to help Young Epilepsy raise awareness&#8212;he certainly shows that young people do not need to let epilepsy get in the way of achieving goals. He said:</p><p>&#8220;My advice to other young people living with the condition would be, don&#8217;t let it hold you back because anything is possible. Regardless of whether you have epilepsy, or any other condition to be honest, it takes a lot of hard work and effort to get where you want to be. I firmly believe that if you put the time and effort in you will be successful&#8221;.</p><p>Let us make sure that all our young people who live with epilepsy can live their lives to the full.

However, as has been pointed out in the chamber and by expert witnesses in committee, the push for efficiency savings in our police forces has already begun. I am concerned that the majority of the additional savings seem to be destined to be made by further cutting the number of civilian staff who are employed by the police. I say &#8220;further cutting&#8221; because&#8212;as we heard from Lewis Macdonald&#8212;the number of civilian staff has already fallen dramatically in recent years. It is not for me or for any of us to quantify how many civilian staff our police need to employ, but the fact is that shedding more than 1,000 staff in just a couple of years cannot fail to have an impact on how our forces operate.</p><p>ACPOS has estimated that, in order to meet the Government&#8217;s pie-in-the-sky savings targets for the new single force, a further 2,000 civilian staff will have to be cut. Some of that number might be accounted for through rationalisation of certain functions, but with potential redundancies on such a massive scale it is inevitable that in order to fill the gaps police officers will have to be taken off front-line duties to fill other roles. I have many concerns about the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Bill that are, by now, fairly well documented, but it is this headlong rush&#8212;the need to hurry through the changes with little regard for the consequences&#8212;that I find really objectionable.</p><p>Chief Constable Kevin Smith&#8212;the man at ACPOS who is responsible for overseeing implementation of the new force&#8212;explained to the Finance Committee the situation in which he finds himself. I will quote him at length, because it is important to put this on the record.</p><p>&#8220;The Government&#8217;s outline business case does not quantify job cuts. However ... If we are to make the savings that have been set out in our budget for the next three years&#8212;and into the next spending review, in fact&#8212;the main focus will be on police staff.&#8221;</p><p>He continued:</p><p>&#8220;Although there will not be an automatic assumption that we will have to put ... a police officer&#8221;</p><p>into support roles,</p><p>&#8220;if we are to get to the numbers on which the savings are based, it is a distinct possibility that that will happen. That will not be a good thing professionally or politically, and I do not think that the public will think it a good thing, either. It is a real risk.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 22 February 2012; c 670-671.]</p><p>He also said:</p><p>&#8220;The danger now is that we will be so focused on making cuts in financial budgets for next year and the following one that we do not get into what the exercise should be about, which is developing the best model of policing for the benefit of the people of Scotland.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 22 February 2012; c 669.]</p><p>Although Chief Constable Smith was talking about the hypothetical situation when the new force comes in, his comments are equally relevant in considering the situation that already exists. Staff are being lost to make savings, but the jobs that they performed still need to be done. In the year to July 2011, Grampian Police reduced its civilian staff by 14 per cent. They lost, among others, a camera enforcement officer, two community wardens, an early intervention worker, an intelligence manager, a welfare officer, a wildlife crime education officer and three road safety advisors. Those jobs still need to be done; the only difference is that they will now have to be done by officers who might otherwise be out on the beat. The more civilian staff who are lost, the more officers will be taken off front-line duties to cover their responsibilities.</p><p>There can only be one result, as another chief constable told me last year:</p><p>&#8220;De-civilianisation, which will occur if whole scale civilian job losses take place, will result in the current community focus model of policing reverting to a crime fighting/call response model of policing where officers run around answering calls for crimes that have occurred because they are no longer able to prevent them.&#8221;</p><p>That is the danger of losing civilian staff, and it is the danger of the Government&#8217;s ill-advised police reform bill.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-02906.1, after &#8220;public&#8221; to insert:</p><p>&#8220;; is concerned that the Scottish Government&#8217;s rushed timetable for the implementation of a national police force, along with unrealistic savings targets, will serve to exacerbate the problem and lead to significant further redundancies among civilian staff&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666972", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Civilian Police Staff"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mr FitzPatrick would do well to focus on what we are here to focus on, which is the running of the service in this country, for which responsibility sits with the Scottish Government.

Currently, we have an efficient, effective and trusted police force across Scotland. The Government is determined to proceed with a single police force, so its responsibility is clear. It must ensure that reform does not irretrievably damage our police service.</p><p>Opposition speakers this morning have rightly pointed out the dangers that are inherent in one strand of the reform. Sadly, we have not heard the same from SNP back benchers. Instead, we have had the usual cheerleading for the Government rather than any sticking up for communities.</p><p>In my opening speech, I mentioned the thought that was floated by a senior officer that the Government&#8217;s reforms risk losing the community focus that is the cornerstone of our current police service&#8212;a point that I think is well worth repeating. Continuing with large-scale reductions in the number of civilian staff will mean that the way that our police service works will change, and not for the better. It will inevitably return to being less about preventing crime and more about reacting to crime. Sadly, the Government seems determined to ignore that concern.</p><p>The Government may trot out its rhetoric on protecting services and creating better ties with communities, but the clear fact is that the reforms are simply not concerned with developing the best model for policing in Scotland.

They are the people who have helped us to reach the current 35-year low in recorded crime. The Government is quick to laud that figure but is all too slow to recognise the role that police support staff have played in achieving it.</p><p>As I said earlier, our intelligence analysts, custody officers and community wardens let our officers spend the maximum time possible out on the beat in the community, keeping our towns safe.

We have not been convinced by the arguments about how the new services will function in practice and we have serious doubts about the outline business case and the estimated savings.</p><p>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the process has been the missed opportunity. When the Government announced its initial consultation last year, it did so proclaiming that it went into it with an open mind. In the consultation, a clear majority of respondents were not in favour of a single national service. Indeed, ACPOS&#8217;s submission stated that a single police force will affect front-line delivery and will increase the risk of a fall in performance, which, it noted, might lead to an increase in crime and more victims. However, the Government still declared that it was persuaded that a single service is the right option. Unfortunately, that means that, rather than being presented with a golden opportunity to modernise our emergency services, we are being pushed towards a centralised and politicised future that will ultimately be to the detriment of local services across the country.</p><p>I have only a little time and there is much to cover, so I will jump straight into some of the highlights, if we can call them that, of the evidence that the committee heard at stage 1.</p><p>First, on cost, many of the Government&#8217;s arguments in favour of a single service have been made on the grounds of the efficiency savings that will be made, but the picture painted by the experts has been far less clear. For example, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers states that:</p><p>&#8220;The business case is deficient in many respects. It is not clear how the proposed reform will improve outcomes that are already very impressive ... The claimed efficiency savings ... rest upon some questionable assumptions&#8221;.</p><p>ACPOS, the Chief Fire Officers Association Scotland and the Scottish Police Federation all agree to a large extent that there is no detail in the business case, and the Government has introduced no evidence that allows us to say with any confidence what, if any, savings the single services will make. Calum Steele of the SPF summed it up very well, telling the Finance Committee:</p><p>&#8220;I very much doubt that anyone could know whether the service would be cheaper or, indeed, more expensive in the future. It is just finger in the air stuff.&#8221;</p><p>Worse, the Government is so determined to make those as yet unsubstantiated savings within its accelerated timescale that it is happy to put cost cutting ahead of positive sustainable reform. ACPOS&#8217;s Chief Constable Smith, the lead on preparatory work for the bill, summed it up, saying:</p><p>&#8220;The danger now is that we will be so focused on making cuts in financial budgets for next year and the following one that we do not get into what the exercise should be about, which is developing the best model of policing for the benefit of the people of Scotland.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 22 February 2012; c 669.]</p><p>The Government&#8217;s haste to push through these politically motivated reforms and to justify them with an unrealistic timetable of savings is putting the future of Scotland&#8217;s police and fire services at risk. Not content with putting our emergency services at risk with an unrealistic timetable, the devil is in the detail of the Government&#8217;s plans.</p><p>One of the key strengths of Scotland&#8217;s policing is and has long been the fact that it is local. It is largely funded by local councils, managed by local officers and officials, accountable to local people and responsive to local needs.

Like many other members, I have consistently pressed the cabinet secretary for action on the disgraceful conditions in Cornton Vale.</p><p>In 2009, Her Majesty&#8217;s chief inspector of prisons declared the prison to be in a state of crisis, citing overcrowding, two-hour waits for the toilet, cold meals, lack of activities and a deep problem of lack of prisoner purpose and activity, which was impeding rehabilitation.</p><p>A follow-up inspection report by the chief inspector in 2011 said that little progress had been made and that there was an immediate need to address overcrowding. It also highlighted several other areas of concern, such as limited access to activities or offending behaviour programmes and high levels of mental health problems, as we heard earlier. In addition, it highlighted something else that has become glaringly obvious to all of us who are concerned about the conditions at Cornton Vale: the lack of strategic prioritisation of the prison by the Scottish Prison Service.</p><p>Only yesterday, Brigadier Monro published a further follow-up report. Although it notes some progress, four of the original recommendations and 10 of the original action points have still not been satisfactorily implemented more than two and a half years after the first report. Many prisoners still lack access to clean bedding, access to clean laundry or even basic privacy. Whatever crimes they have committed, it is deplorable that they continue to be denied those basic human dignities.</p><p>The latest inspection report also highlighted the unacceptable use of silent cells. The fact that, despite previous warnings, extremely vulnerable prisoners continue to be placed in cells with a single mattress on a concrete plinth, no ventilation and no natural light, shows that the management culture in the Prison Service has still not changed. I have been concerned by the culture of complacency in the SPS and the lack of direction from the cabinet secretary, who has routinely maintained that those failings are operational matters for the SPS. Therefore, I hope that the Angiolini report will mark a change of attitude in the SPS.</p><p>I am delighted that the commission recommends that Cornton Vale be replaced with a new, smaller specialist prison for the most serious offenders, and that most of those who are on remand or serving short-term sentences should be held in local prisons. I agree whole-heartedly with that.</p><p>However, if we are to reduce reoffending, we must look beyond the management culture and fabric of Cornton Vale. That is why I welcome the comprehensive nature of Dame Elish&#8217;s report and commend all the members of the commission for their insight.</p><p>We have 37 recommendations, which are radical in their scope, and there is much with which everyone can agree. The report considers what happens to women at every stage through the criminal justice system, from when they are only at risk of offending and when they are at the point of arrest, through to sentencing options and resettlement on release from prison.</p><p>The report also urges us to address the factors that contribute to women&#8217;s offending behaviour, and stresses the value of offering women new life choices and valuable learning experiences so that we help them to develop confidence and self-esteem that will reduce the risk of their reoffending. In that respect, the report echoes what Baroness Corston called for some years ago, which was</p><p>&#8220;a seamless continuation of care&#8221;</p><p>inside and outside prison and a focus on women&#8217;s accommodation needs. She suggested that the problems that lead to women&#8217;s offending respond far more to casework, support and treatment in the community than to imprisonment.</p><p>It is clear that the criminal justice system utterly fails women who find themselves subject to it. The failures that the report exposes impact not only on women offenders, but on the communities in which they live and into which they resettle, the victims of their crimes and&#8212;this is perhaps the saddest thing&#8212;their children, who themselves become vulnerable. We know that approximately 30 per cent of children with imprisoned parents will develop physical and mental health problems and that there is a higher risk of those children also ending up in prison.</p><p>The report sets out clearly why we should take a gender-specific approach to dealing with reducing offending. It has been demonstrated that services for women need to resonate with their needs and experiences and that simply adapting programmes, interventions and services that have been developed for male offenders is unlikely to meet appropriately the complex needs of female offenders.</p><p>We have already heard that women offenders are themselves often victims of severe and repeated physical and sexual abuse. There are shocking levels of mental ill-health and self-harm in prison. We know that 80 per cent of those who are in Cornton Vale have mental health problems.</p><p>I support the approach that is outlined in the report&#8217;s parts 3, 4 and 5 on service redesign, alternatives to prosecution and alternatives to remand. Short-term prison sentences have little or no impact on reoffending, with 70 per cent of women offenders who receive a prison sentence of three months or less reconvicted for an offence within two years.</p><p>I have no doubt that, for minor offences, prison is rarely the right answer. It is far better that community-based schemes, whereby offenders contribute locally to making reparations, be the option of choice. Work in the community that challenges and changes people for the better is a positive and constructive way forward.</p><p>The commission rightly points to the vital role of throughcare. Roderick Campbell mentioned the work that we carried out on that on the Justice Committee.</p><p>The one recommendation that gives me pause for thought is the setting up of a national community justice service. Such centralisation seems contrary to the rest of the report, which emphasises a tailored community-based response. Criminal justice social work is rightly part of the local government family and the development of close links between criminal justice services, social work services, housing, education, and drugs and alcohol services has meant that progress has been made on tackling the root causes of crime. I am concerned that setting up a national service would be expensive, disruptive and would lead to the loss of such integration of local services. However, the fragmentation and confusion that are illustrated in the report mean that the issue must be addressed in some way, so we must further consider the matter.</p><p>The report has some frank words to say about the lack of leadership that has existed until now. It will certainly take strong and sustained leadership to make many of the recommendations work, but investment that reduces reoffending will benefit all of our communities and produce lasting results that will make Scotland a fairer and more compassionate country.

As we have heard, it contains two very disparate pieces of legislation. Although not unprecedented, it is not a particularly sensible way to legislate as it ties Parliament's hands. Although part 2 is couched in general terms, we all know that its overriding purpose was to facilitate the publication of the statement of reasons in the al-Megrahi case. Indeed, some might say that it is no longer required, given that a national newspaper published that very document a few weeks ago. Such a development simply highlights how events can overtake us and exposes the dangers that are inherent in linking together two totally separate items in a bill. The fact that part 2 is tied to part 1 means that it cannot be dropped unless we are prepared to allow the whole bill to fall. Of course, that would not be sensible, so we must press on with part 2, however unnecessary it might be. Although it is highly unlikely, I accept that another abandoned appeal in the future might raise significant public interest. However, as the committee convener said, we had little time to take evidence on the general applicability of the provisions as, understandably, most of our evidence related to the Megrahi case.</p><p>I support the view that a full and detailed account of the events surrounding Lockerbie should be available to us all. For too long, there has been speculation about the case. As Humza Yousaf rightly pointed out, publication of the statement of reasons would never have resolved all the outstanding issues, but it is an important, if limited, step. Without a doubt, it is in the public interest to know why Mr Megrahi was allowed to appeal. It is vital for Scotland that our justice system is open and transparent and, if mistakes have been made, we must learn the lessons so that justice can be served.</p><p>I will focus the rest of my comments on part 1, which relates to the punishment part of non-mandatory life sentences, as we have heard. As the cabinet secretary outlined&#8212;the committee convener developed the point in her detailed seminar&#8212;it sets out to correct a situation that arose following the appeal court judgment in March 2011 in the case of Petch and Foye v Her Majesty&#8217;s Advocate, which meant that prisoners who are given a discretionary life sentence or an order for lifelong restriction can apply to become eligible for parole earlier than those who are serving sentences of a fixed length. The bill is intended to restore to the courts the discretion to set a punishment part of sentences when it considers that appropriate in the circumstances.</p><p>Yet again, the Scottish Government finds itself having to play catch-up in relation to ECHR compliance. It has had to get out the sticking plasters again. The fact that this is the latest in a string of such cases highlights the need to ECHR proof all our legislation rather than only responding after the fact. Indeed, the committee&#8217;s report draws attention to the interim nature of what is proposed. It is surely time that we looked closely at our body of law and reviewed exactly how it sits in relation to our ECHR responsibilities.</p><p>I support what the Government is trying to achieve with part 1, but I question whether it is going about it in the right way. Our committee report highlights concerns about the unnecessary complexity of the proposals. Public confidence in the law and ease of understanding ought to be central to our justice system. Sentencing is a crucial part of that, and it should be readily understood by all those who are involved as well as the wider public. The bill is intended to simplify the situation, yet the Law Society maintains that</p><p>&#8220;the Bill will not give rise to a clear legislative solution&#8221;,</p><p>because what is proposed by way of calculation and comparison exercises is similar to what has gone before and may itself bring further confusion and uncertainty, which would give rise to its own complexities.</p><p>We heard in evidence from the Faculty of Advocates that this is complicating the issue significantly and interfering with judicial independence, and that there are questions about the extent to which it is appropriate to seek to restrict, control and direct the exercise of judgments. There is a danger that sentencing is becoming too formulaic and we are tying the hands of judges and interfering with their discretion.</p><p>I draw members&#8217; attention to the paragraphs on pages 16 to 18 of our report on public confidence and clarity in sentencing. As Jenny Marra pointed out, James Wolffe QC characterised the approach of the bill as being</p><p>&#8220;to take an already complex piece of legislation and make it even more complex.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 31 January 2012; c 864.]</p><p>James Chalmers of the University of Edinburgh considered that the bill</p><p>&#8220;seeks to create a tortuous system which is barely intelligible to lawyers, let alone the general public&#8221;.</p><p>He went on to state that he had not spoken to anyone who had felt comfortable in reading it and working out what judges are required to do under it.</p><p>The committee is of the view that the Government should consider whether a less prescriptive approach would be clearer and more appropriate. I have considered the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response that the matter is necessarily complex, but I remain of the view that we ought to be doing everything possible to simplify it, and I ask the cabinet secretary to give further thought to that during stage 2.</p><p>I have some sympathy with the view that the sentencing legislative framework has become unduly complex and should be reviewed in its entirety to provide greater clarity. I urge the Government to give serious consideration to that in the longer term.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665465", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Cases (Punishment and Review) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other committee members, I am grateful to everyone who submitted evidence on the bill, because they certainly helped us to get to grips with an extremely technical piece of legislation.

It is not often that we talk about reducing crime in the context of the services that are available for those who have committed a crime. I think that that is unfortunate. Scotland&#8217;s prisons are overcrowded. Our prison population has increased by 25 per cent over the past 10 years. That is a worrying statistic in itself, but if we delve a little deeper we get to truly startling figures: 62 per cent of Scottish prisoners reoffend within two years of being released and more than one in 10 offenders who went to prison in 2010 had served 10 or more previous prison sentences.</p><p>Audit Scotland&#8217;s recent report on the criminal justice system identified that the cost per prisoner place is &#163;34,279 per year, which does not include the cost of processing the case through the courts. It is clear that it is time for us to take a new look at the rehabilitation services and programmes that we provide in prisons. That is what our motion is about: the opportunities that we provide for those who find themselves behind bars.</p><p>I use the word &#8220;opportunities&#8221; quite deliberately; of course we do not seek to reward people for committing a crime, but it is only right that we give them the chance to better themselves. It is our responsibility to give offenders the chance to address the issues that led them to prison in the first place and the chance to move past their crime and contribute positively to society. Frankly, if we are not giving offenders that chance, we are failing them and&#8212;just as bad&#8212;we are failing the society that they are being released back into. Indeed, it is only in giving offenders the chance to better themselves that prison can be said to be working.</p><p>At present, our prisons simply do not have the capacity or the facilities that are needed to support properly the rehabilitation of offenders, so what we get instead is a vicious cycle. Existing rehabilitation programmes cannot succeed, at least partly because prisoners have limited access to them in overcrowded prisons. That means that fewer offenders can successfully participate in the programmes, more offenders reoffend, the prison population grows still further and the rehabilitation programmes become still less able to cope.</p><p>I am happy to recognise that good progress is being made on the prison estate itself. HMP Low Moss opened its doors just this week, plans for the new HMP Grampian at Peterhead are moving forward and the Government&#8217;s recent budget included &#163;20 million to be spent on much-needed improvements to the women&#8217;s prison estate. Those are all positive steps. However, when all is said and done, there is only so much that can be achieved by modernising the prison estate. We must also address the rehabilitation programmes themselves. Audit Scotland concluded:</p><p>&#8220;Funding arrangements are complex and do not always provide a financial incentive to reduce reoffending.&#8221;</p><p>As I said, the reconviction rate in Scotland is too high but, more worryingly, it is consistent. The reconviction rate today is more or less the same as it was 13 years ago when the Parliament first opened. In that time, the rate has never varied by more than a few percentage points either way, despite the Government having a national indicator to reduce offending.</p><p>How can we revolutionise prisoner rehabilitation and finally start to bring down the reconviction rate? We believe that we need help from specialists. The simple fact is that, when ex-offenders get a job after leaving prison, the likelihood of their reoffending is cut dramatically&#8212;by as much as 50 per cent. However, figures show that offenders are 13 times more likely to be unemployed than those in the rest of society. The Scottish Prison Service&#8217;s latest survey reveals stark numbers on the problems that many offenders face. Forty per cent of prisoners reported that drug use was a problem for them on the outside; a quarter of prisoners reported that alcohol use had affected their ability to hold down a job; and one in five prisoners reported problems with literacy and numeracy.</p><p>Social enterprise is well placed to tackle holistically the range of needs of repeat offenders. In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, we are blessed with a wealth of voluntary organisations, social enterprises and charities that specialise in providing precisely the sort of support that those offenders need to push them back towards playing a positive role in society. Therefore, why not look to those bodies to do just that?</p><p>There are plenty of examples of innovative approaches to tackling reoffending, such as the Foundation Training Company, which is a not-for-profit organisation that provides a through-the-gate mentoring and resettlement service for prisoners. The organisation leads programmes and workshops in prisons that are aimed at equipping offenders with computer skills and which provide literacy and job application training. To date, the Foundation Training Company has helped more than 11,000 prisoners, 95 per cent of whom have achieved at least one nationally recognised award. Research from the Home Office has shown that the likelihood of reoffending is reduced by 7 per cent among those who have completed one of the Foundation Training Company&#8217;s courses.</p><p>Those are the sort of positive and innovative interventions that we should do everything possible to encourage. The Liberal Democrats believe that using the social impact bond model is the perfect way to do just that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663220", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offenders (Rehabilitation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to be able to move my motion.

There is good reason to proceed with further pilots to assess the model. The Finance Committee has considered the issue and Audit Scotland has recommended that we have a look at the model. Therefore, we should push forward with it.</p><p>I will outline how social impact bonds work and explain why I think that they are a good idea. They are contracts with Government or local authorities, with a commitment to pay for agreed social outcomes. In the case of offenders, that would be lower rates of reoffending. On that basis, investment is raised and used to fund interventions, such as rehabilitation or work programmes. If the interventions succeed, the investors&#8217; initial outlay is repaid by the Government, along with a financial return that is scaled in relation to the degree of success, which in the case of offenders would be exactly how much reoffending has reduced. That contrasts with Audit Scotland&#8217;s conclusion that</p><p>&#8220;The way criminal justice social work services are currently funded does not provide a financial incentive to change offenders&#8217; behaviour&#8221;.</p><p>That is a reason why social impact bonds are a good way forward.</p><p>The payment-by-results approach has a couple of other benefits. First, there is no cost to the public purse unless reoffending is reduced. The Government pays only for the finished painting, rather than simply buying a canvas and a brush and hoping for the best. By bringing new money into the criminal justice system on the basis of repayment that is based on results, the Government can introduce a solid preventative spending initiative even at a time when the budget is stretched.</p><p>That leads directly to the second and more important reason why we believe that social impact bonds should be piloted in Scotland. Because the investment risk is kept squarely on private sector investors, there is a motivation for operators of the schemes to ensure that they succeed. That means that high standards are maintained and innovation is encouraged. In turn, that provides us with a further opportunity. As innovative new ideas are developed, spurred on by the payment-by-results model, the Government can monitor progress and, ultimately, adopt the most successful initiatives as examples of future best practice.</p><p>The use of social impact bonds can also help to shift the focus for the expert organisations. Rather than jump through bureaucratic red tape to secure grant funding, they can work co-operatively and move the focus of their efforts much more on to the social impact of their work.</p><p>Members might be aware of the pilot that is under way at Peterborough prison in which a number of organisations, including the YMCA and Supporting Others through Volunteer Action&#8212;SOVA&#8212;are using their expertise to provide support to short-term prisoners. The scheme still has a while left to run, as Chic Brodie said, before we see quantifiable evidence on its success, but the initial reports are largely positive. The report &#8220;Social Impact Bonds. The One Service. One year on&#8221;, which reflects on the first 12 months of the scheme, is a fascinating read and it highlights another benefit of the social impact bond model&#8212;the ability for service providers to identify and target individual needs in a far greater way than the existing programmes. The initial figures in the report suggest that 88 per cent of prisoners who were part of the programme in the first year underwent a successful assignment.</p><p>Given the current financial climate, which means that we must carefully evaluate our spending commitments, and the continuing high levels of reoffending in Scotland, this is surely an ideal time to move ahead with our own pilot schemes. Truth be told, I hoped that our motion would receive support from the Government benches, but Kenny MacAskill&#8217;s amendment suggests that that will not be the case. That is disappointing, not least because, as recently as last May, we seemed to be in agreement on the issue. Indeed, the following line was in the Scottish National Party&#8217;s manifesto:</p><p>&#8220;We will identify and commence three projects through which we can pilot Social Impact Bonds.&#8221;</p><p>That commitment is echoed in our motion, yet by lodging his amendment, the cabinet secretary seems to be pulling back from that position. When will he introduce a pilot scheme, and why will he not commit to the use of social impact bonds in prisons?</p><p>The use of social impact bonds would encourage greater innovation in our offender rehabilitation programmes. We should not miss this important opportunity finally to make some real progress on reducing reoffending. I hope that the Parliament will support our motion.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that successful rehabilitation is vital in order to reduce reoffending rates and support ex-offenders to turn their lives around; further recognises the role that voluntary organisations and social enterprises can play in delivering innovative and high quality programmes to address offending behaviour; believes that Social Impact Bonds have the potential to deliver a new approach to investment in rehabilitation, which incentivises innovation and rewards positive outcomes, and calls on the Scottish Government to pilot the Social Impact Bond model as a new approach to prison rehabilitation and reducing reoffending.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663220", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offenders (Rehabilitation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, I do not accept that.

The Labour Party says that that is not decisive enough and suggests that the referendum was not conducted properly, but it has not provided any evidence for that. It is a bit rich of the Labour Party to talk about the result not being clear.

It should be a matter of great shame that this modern manifestation of a truly vile crime exists at all here in Scotland. There is a widespread lack of public understanding of the problem and of its manifestations. Most Scots are unaware of the extent of the problem and they would, of course, be appalled to learn what is going on, but that lack of knowledge allows the crimes to go undetected.</p><p>Trafficking is multifaceted, and by its very nature is a hidden crime. Those who ought to help and protect its victims, including police officers, border officials and social workers, must rely on a degree of public awareness to alert them to potential trafficking victims. We need to develop far better public and professional awareness of trafficking. The debate will, I hope shed some light on the issue and be a catalyst for change.</p><p>We can draw on a series of studies and reports published over the past two years that scope out the scale of the problem of human trafficking in Scotland and identify shortcomings in our approach to stamping it out. I refer to the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Equal Opportunities Committee report on migration and trafficking, the report by Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, entitled &#8220;Scotland: A safe place for traffickers&#8221;, and the January 2012 EHRC Scotland inquiry report, which many of us have focused on this afternoon. Disappointingly, there has been little response to the reports so far. If the recommendations were acted on, the situation for victims could be improved and Scotland made a more hostile and less profitable place for traffickers.</p><p>The EHRC inquiry report, which is the most recent of the reports, is unambiguous in its recommendations. The Scottish Government must accept the 10 key recommendations and take action. The inquiry&#8217;s findings are shocking. They state that human trafficking exists throughout Scotland, with its victims&#8212;women, girls, boys and men&#8212;found not only in private sex flats but in hotels, restaurants, farms, sweatshop factories and domestic servitude.</p><p>We know that Scotland is lagging behind in tackling this most appalling crime. We have heard already that it was last September when Scotland eventually saw the conviction of two individuals for sex trafficking&#8212;the first successful prosecution under section 22 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003. That compares with more than 150 successful prosecutions in England and Wales.</p><p>We have already heard that the scoping study by Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People found that at least 80 children, and possibly many more, were trafficked into Scotland over a period of 18 months without a single person being convicted of that crime. Those children have been sold, stolen, taken off the streets and transported thousands of miles&#8212;sometimes, they were just given up by their families in the belief that they would have a better life elsewhere. While trafficked children might face sexual exploitation, other forms of abuse, which might be just as common, include forced labour, benefit fraud and domestic servitude.</p><p>It is clear that the number of referrals of suspected child trafficking cases is likely to represent only the tip of the iceberg. Many more children are likely to remain unidentified.</p><p>It is important to stress that trafficked people are victims and not an immigration problem. Policing and victim care and support must be improved, and the restoration of the victim&#8217;s human rights must be put at the heart of a new approach.</p><p>The EHRC reports that Scotland does not yet have a comprehensive, end-to-end service for victims of human trafficking. To my mind, that is a comprehensive failure. The Human Trafficking Foundation has identified that the level and quality of accommodation, medical assistance, health services, interpreting services and legal assistance that are made available to trafficked people varies widely depending on the type of exploitation to which the person has been subjected, their location and the capacity of the local support providers.</p><p>The foundation also points out that, although safe and appropriate accommodation is vital, the convention includes lots of other support that people are entitled to, such as access to psychological support, interpretative material, medical assistance, legal advice, compensation, legal redress, assistance with repatriation and return, and education for children. We are a long way from reaching that standard. That chimes with the recommendation on finding 10 in the EHRC report, which states:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government should develop a Trafficking Care Standard and introduce an end-to-end service for trafficking victims.&#8221;</p><p>My predecessor in my portfolio, Robert Brown, raised concerns in the previous session that the Commonwealth games in Glasgow would bring an increase in trafficking. I think that his concerns were taken lightly, despite the evidence from other events. For example, in the run-up to the Olympics in London, the vice unit of the Metropolitan Police was given an extra &#163;600,000 to pay for a specialist unit to work over three years to tackle trafficking in the five Olympic boroughs.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662015", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Trafficking"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as a member of the cross-party group on human rights.

Difficult decisions will have to be made locally to balance the books. Like the budget that we debated yesterday, the local government settlement is tight. A significant cut faces local authorities, and we cannot ignore the impact of capital allocations that have been borrowed or deferred, which creates a greater cost to councils.</p><p>As in other years, councils have had to agree to a series of Government demands, on maintaining police and teacher numbers, contributing to change funds and reprofiling capital funding.

Those are inputs; surely we should focus on results.</p><p>It is clear that councils&#8217; autonomy is being rapidly eroded, which is quite ironic given that the SNP Government never stops demanding to be set free from UK Government restraint. The moratorium on planned school closures and the proposals for national police and fire services are further examples of creeping centralisation.

The grant-aided expenditure process must be simplified. Currently, more than 100 indicators are used, several of which are extremely flawed. About 66 per cent of expenditure is determined by only 12 indicators. The reality is that the existing grants system, which has been in place with a few modifications since the late 1970s, was designed to meet the needs of the larger regional councils.

Liberal Democrats are committed to enabling older and disabled people to live independently and with dignity in their own homes for as long as possible. Bridging the gap between health and social care is essential if we are to make that a reality. This is an opportunity to put people not process at the heart of health and social care services.</p><p>Liberal Democrats believe that health care should be delivered as locally as possible. Despite much rhetoric on shifting the balance of care, most spending is still directed towards acute services. Often, people are being cared for in hospitals miles from their homes when they would receive better and more cost-effective care closer to home in the community.</p><p>More than 60 per cent of Scottish Government spending on care for older people is still on care in hospitals and care homes and almost a third is spent on emergency or non-elective hospital admissions. Only 6.7 per cent of the budget is allocated to providing care at home. Earlier this year, NHS Grampian&#8217;s medical director warned that, unless health services, local authorities and individuals work together, we would have to build a new, 600-bed hospital in Scotland every year from now to be able to cope. In addition, he reckoned that every person leaving school would have to find a job in the NHS in order for us to provide enough care for the elderly.</p><p>As well as being better for the individual, supporting an older person to retain their independence is much cheaper. Reducing delayed discharge and unplanned admissions to hospital and increasing the number of older people who live at home rather than in a care home or hospital are not new ideas, but it is proving difficult to achieve the switch in resource.

Some are little more than large and unwieldy talking shops and, in other areas, the relevant health boards and local authorities have failed to co-operate. In many areas, that has led to general practitioners completely disengaging from CHPs.</p><p>I share the cabinet secretary&#8217;s ambition that the reform should be transformational and I agree that nationally agreed outcomes, integrated budgets and leadership are the foundations for change. However, it is important that local responsiveness is not lost, and I welcome the Government&#8217;s recognition of that point, too. We need to treat people as partners in their care.

I cannot support that.</p><p>If the minister is unable to answer more than one in every six questions that she is asked about the bill, how can she possibly claim that the Government has made the case for two new criminal offences to be created?</p><p>If expert groups such as Liberty and the Law Society, football clubs such as Rangers and Celtic, supporters groups from clubs across the country and religious groups of all faiths do not think that the bill is a solution to the problem, what exactly does the minister believe we are achieving here today?</p><p>In his announcement after stage 1, the First Minister said:</p><p>&#8220;On this issue above all, I want consensus; I want consensus across the chamber and across our partner organisations.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 23 June 2011; c 1020.]</p><p>At stage 1, five members&#8212;my colleagues on the Liberal Democrat seats and I&#8212;voted against the bill. At stage 2, 53 members could not support the bill. The more we have studied the detail of the bill, the more of us have come to realise that it simply is not workable.</p><p>The First Minister was right to seek consensus, but it will prove to be a hollow gesture if the bill is passed today, because although consensus has been found, it is consensus that the bill is not what we need. The First Minister now has a choice. He can step back from the brink again; he can withdraw the bill and ask us all in Parliament to work together on a lasting solution to sectarianism and offensive behaviour in Scotland. No-one here would criticise him for that. We would applaud him and we would get on and work with him.</p><p>Alternatively, he can use his majority to force this unwise, unwarranted and unworkable bill on to our statute books. In this Parliament, in which there is an SNP majority, we cannot stop him.

It is a thorough and reasoned piece of work, and we must now give full and fair consideration to its recommendations. His approach has been not merely to do the bare minimum to comply with the European convention on human rights; instead, as he puts it, he has been at pains to</p><p>&#8220;re-establish Scotland at the forefront of the law and practice of human rights in general.&#8221;</p><p>Lord Carloway admits that he has</p><p>&#8220;challenged traditional legal thinking, looking to modernise, clarify and simplify the system as a whole wherever possible&#8221;.</p><p>I sincerely hope that the legal profession and the wider criminal justice system are open to change and reform. Let us not forget that the Cadder ruling was possible only because we did not take sufficient heed of warnings that the right to a fair trial was being compromised by our processes, relying instead on a perhaps complacent view that our justice system was the best. At the time of the Cadder ruling, some people took the view that this had tilted the justice system in favour of the suspect and that there needed therefore to be some rebalancing. I welcome Lord Carloway&#8217;s assurance that</p><p>&#8220;the Review has not sought to analyse whether there has been a tilting or not and, in any event, in whose favour the balance has wavered. It has not approached its remit with a view to re-adjusting the system in favour of any particular institution or group of persons.&#8221;</p><p>Protecting peoples&#8217; rights and ensuring a fair trial must be at the heart of any reforms. Our justice system must be robust and fully compliant with the ECHR. Lord Carloway&#8217;s report has those goals at its core, but the changes put forward are both radical and substantial, and so will need further detailed study. Lord Carloway has certainly pushed his remit to the limit.</p><p>Understandably, the recommendation that has caused the most debate is that of abolishing the need for corroboration. Some of Lord Carloway&#8217;s own review group demurred from that finding. The Law Society of Scotland expressed grave concerns, and Maggie Scott QC, the chair of Justice Scotland, said that the removal of corroboration would risk &#8220;justice being undone&#8221;. High Court judges and sheriffs have also expressed their concern.</p><p>Corroboration is a long-established rule to prevent wrongful convictions, which bring the law into disrepute. It is one of the primary foundations of the system of Scots criminal law, and it serves as an important safeguard against miscarriages of justice. A proposal to abandon corroboration, especially without the introduction of formal guidelines to assess the quality of evidence, would certainly weaken that safeguard. Lord Carloway gave evidence to the Justice Committee on Tuesday of this week, and it was interesting to have the opportunity to explore in detail his reasoning for this particular recommendation. He explained to the committee that he</p><p>&#8220;could find no evidence that in Scotland, which is the only country in the world that has a rule on corroboration across the board, there is a lower miscarriage of justice rate than in any other country in the civilised world&#8212;and nobody suggested to us that it has.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to explain:</p><p>&#8220;We looked at the other side of the coin and asked whether corroboration is actually impeding justice, and we concluded that that is exactly what it is doing in cases in which there is a victim of crime and coincidentally there does not happen to be corroboration.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 29 November 2011; c 529-30.]</p><p>That is an interesting argument, and it is worthy of serious consideration. We must be careful, however. Just because corroboration has not been the gold-plated guarantee of a fair trial that we thought it was, that does not mean to say that it is worthless. It remains a good safeguard. It could also be argued that it encourages rigour in any investigation. We should be extremely cautious about any proposal to abolish it, because once the change is made, there will be no going back.</p><p>I genuinely look forward to further debate on this recommendation, but as yet I remain to be convinced that it would be the right way forward. If the Government is of a mind to pursue it, however, surely a change of this magnitude deserves further detailed scrutiny. Given the significance of the proposed change, I wonder whether the next step ought to be the establishment of a royal commission on criminal evidence. I urge the cabinet secretary seriously to consider that route. The Scottish National Party must not use its majority to pass legislation on such an important issue without giving it really detailed scrutiny.</p><p>There is much to welcome in the report, not least the added protections that are proposed for children and vulnerable adults. I support the recommendations that all children should have the right of access to a parent, carer or responsible person if detained, and that the general role of the parent, carer or responsible person should be defined in statute as consisting of the provision of any moral support, parental care and guidance to the child and promoting the child&#8217;s understanding of any communications between him or her, the police and his or her solicitor. Those would be valuable safeguards for our young people. It is also right that no child should be able to waive their right to access to a lawyer.</p><p>There is clearly a requirement for further consultation before coming to a statutory definition of the terms &#8220;vulnerable suspect&#8221; and &#8220;appropriate adult&#8221;. The safeguards proposed to limit the time for which a suspect can be held in detention before appearing before a court are also welcome. Lord Carloway has resisted recommending the setting up of Saturday courts, but recommends that the matter be kept under review. I would go further and suggest that the justice secretary should now consider the need for Saturday courts, to ensure that our system is as fair and robust as possible.</p><p>The proposals relating to police bail and investigative liberation are innovations that require further consideration.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats will carefully consider the proposals in Lord Carloway&#8217;s report and look forward to debating the matter in greater detail over the coming months. Scotland must have a robust and fair justice system that is fit for the 21st century and fully accommodates our ECHR commitments.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656451", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Law and Practice (Carloway Review)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the publication of Lord Carloway&#8217;s report.

The Government is still quick to trumpet our &#8220;world-leading&#8221; climate change bill, but is rather more circumspect when it comes to actually putting in place the measures that will enable us to meet our ambitious targets. I will turn to that in a moment; however, I start by welcoming the fact that Scotland will be represented on the UK Government&#8217;s delegation to the COP17 conference in Durban next week. It is important to recognise the work that has been done by Chris Huhne at the Department for Energy and Climate Change, not only in driving the UK Government forward to ensure that it is the &#8220;greenest&#8221; ever, but also for the pro-active and inclusive approach that he has taken in engaging with the Scottish Government.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s motion is right to highlight that action on climate change should not be seen as a burden but, rather, as an opportunity for innovation and growth. Scotland has the opportunity to develop itself as a green energy powerhouse, and it is right that we are able to share our experiences with the rest of the world. As has been said already today, the fight against climate change cannot succeed on the basis of action being taken in just one country. The conference of the parties summit is a vital forum for engagement, and I am pleased that it is one in which Scotland can participate fully.</p><p>The motion this afternoon also notes the urgent need for action. I fully endorse that sentiment. Early action is absolutely vital&#8212;global action that will mitigate and limit the worst effects of climate change, and the action that we need to take here to meet the targets in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. On that, I was interested to see the Minister&#8217;s appearance at Rural Affairs, Environment and Climate Change Committee yesterday to discuss the use of carbon credits towards targets from 2013.</p><p>From the beginning of our work on the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, everyone involved was clear that domestic effort must be the focus of our efforts. The use of carbon units should be a last resort: indeed, we chose not to allow them to be used towards the 2010, 2011 and 2012 targets at all. I recognise, of course, that in setting the latest limits, the minister is following the advice of the UK Committee on Climate Change and that the availability of carbon units does not necessarily mean that they will be used.

That is not surprising because, as we have already heard from the minister, there are more than 650,000 unpaid adult carers and more than 100,000 young carers in Scotland, each one of whom provides valuable support. In one way, that is great. After all, if people who have long-term illnesses, disabilities or other health problems are being looked after by their friends or family, they are being looked after properly in their own home by people who know them well and really care for them. Without those carers, many people would have less fulfilling lives and the cost to the state would be immense, so it is in everyone&#8217;s interests that they are supported.</p><p>We are all quick to acknowledge the invaluable work that carers do day in and day out, week after week, but carers tell me that, although it is nice to be valued, they do not need gold stars or plaudits; they need proper help, support and respect. A carers&#8217; rights charter is overdue. The carers strategy promised that a charter would be in place by December, but the year 1 progress report tells us:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government will shortly commission the production of the Carers Rights Charter from the voluntary sector.&#8221;</p><p>I hope that the minister can tell us why it has been stalled and agree that it is time that the Government got on with delivering it.</p><p>The Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill will be introduced shortly and, among other things, will enable self-directed support for carers. However, the extension of rights to carers in the draft bill is not as strong as it could be as, in its current form, the bill gives only a discretionary power to local authorities to support carers. The organisations that represent carers have said that they are keen to see the power expressed as a duty on councils. The bill will be an opportunity to give carers a right to be recognised and supported and I ask the Government to reconsider its approach.</p><p>The carers strategy has our broad support and I acknowledge the progress that has been made, but there is still so much to do to translate worthy sentiment into reality. What is it like for carers today? For too many, it is a life of poverty, isolation, frustration, ill health and depression. Many people give up an income, future employment prospects and pension rights to become a carer. Many carers also work outside the home and have to juggle jobs with their responsibilities as carers. The majority of carers struggle alone and do not know that help is available to them. Carers tell us that access to information, financial support and breaks is vital in helping them to manage the impact that caring has on their life. Carers tell me of their anger and frustration that the care of their loved ones by the NHS or other home care workers is not as good as it should be.</p><p>It is time for carers to be recognised as equal partners in care. They are experts who understand their loved ones and they can work with professionals to ensure that the personalised care that each individual needs brings them the best quality of life.</p><p>My amendment asks Parliament to recognise</p><p>&#8220;that access to short breaks is a vital part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s preventative approach&#8221;.</p><p>Regular breaks from caring are essential to carers if they are to continue in their caring role. The benefits and cost savings of short breaks are clear. Carers are half as likely to suffer mental health problems if they have a break. A 2009 report demonstrated that, if effective short breaks were delivered to all disabled children in England for whom short breaks were appropriate, the potential saving to the state could be in the region of &#163;174 million per year.</p><p>Some people are being offered only a few hours&#8217; break each week, while people in similar situations in other areas are given more hours, so the approach to needs assessment is inconsistent. There is a worrying lack of accessible respite in rural areas, with the respite hours being reduced because of the time that has to be spent travelling to the service. Lack of suitable respite, choice and flexibility and a lack of involvement with carers and service users in planning short breaks are other issues. More and more breaks are offered only as emergency relief, which means that carers cannot access respite that could prevent crisis situations.</p><p>When carers and their families are forced to struggle on until they can no longer cope, the pressure increases on local services because crisis situations often result in hospitalisation. I urge the Government to work with local authorities and health boards to introduce a short-break entitlement for those who are in greatest need. Carers who have significant caring responsibilities should be entitled to a guaranteed minimum number of hours of respite care.</p><p>As well as ensuring equality of access, short breaks should be innovative, personalised and flexible, so that they meet carers&#8217; needs. Carers and service users should be partners in the planning of short breaks, and the focus should be on early intervention and prevention. Because the average cost of a week&#8217;s stay in hospital is more than &#163;3,000 while a care home place costs around &#163;600 a week, it is clearly in everyone&#8217;s interests to prevent crisis situations from developing.</p><p>The continuation of the change fund is welcome. A great deal of excellent work is undoubtedly funded through the reshaping care change fund pilot, but the mid-year review of funding allocation has given cause for concern. The analysis shows that only 18 per cent has been allocated to preventative and anticipatory care and 19 per cent has been spent on hospital and institutional care, which essentially means that we are investing in other ways of providing existing services.</p><p>The commitment on dedicating at least 20 per cent of the change fund to supporting carers is to be welcomed, given the increase in demand that carers organisations are experiencing. Last year, the Princess Royal Trust for Carers supported some 54,500 unpaid carers through a network of 29 carers centres. However, there are still questions about the extent to which that money will reach community-based support projects and benefit carers on the ground.

Those come on top of the testimony of Tommy Whitelaw to MSPs in the Parliament building a couple of weeks ago. Although I was unable to attend the event, I read his comments later and, like Fiona McLeod, I found them extremely moving.</p><p>Bill Kidd reminded us that we all know carers&#8212;they are our neighbours, friends, colleagues and family members. Fiona McLeod talked about the power of personal testimony. I have close personal experience of the challenges and frustrations that carers face in trying to get the right support, as my father has become a full-time carer for my mother after her stroke. I pay tribute to my father for the way in which he has taken on that role so late in life.</p><p>Many have rightly praised the role of carers support groups such as the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, which plays a vital role in helping carers to carry on. Those groups face growing demand and funding pressures. The three quarters of a million carers and young carers in Scotland provide valuable support that is worth an estimated &#163;10.3 billion to the Scottish economy. As many members have said, it is therefore in everyone&#8217;s interest to ensure that they are supported in their vital role. That is even more pressing given Scotland&#8217;s ageing population. However, carers still face too many hurdles and frustrations.</p><p>The tragic thing is that we know what needs to be done. The strategy is clear on that and it acknowledges that</p><p>&#8220;There is a strong case based on human rights, economic, efficiency and quality of care grounds for supporting carers.&#8221;</p><p>It goes on to state:</p><p>&#8220;Without the valuable contribution of Scotland&#8217;s carers, the health and social care system would not be sustained. Activity should focus on identifying, assessing and supporting carers in a personalised and outcome-focused way and on a consistent and uniform basis.&#8221;</p><p>I agree, but the difficulty lies in turning the strategy and fine words into reality and upping the pace of change.</p><p>Many issues that must be tackled have been discussed, including providing better respite, properly supporting young carers, particularly in rural areas, and addressing the health needs of older carers. We have also heard about particular issues that affect groups such as carers who support individuals who are affected by alcohol and substance abuse, as well as issues to do with older carers and even emergency planning for carers. Proper working together across health board and council boundaries is essential if we are to make progress.</p><p>It would be helpful if the minister were to explain in summing up the debate what parameters his Government will set in its agreement with local authorities as part of the draft budget. Last year, there was an expectation that local authorities would make progress on implementing the carers and young carers strategy. How has that been evaluated and what will the Government require of local authorities from 2012 onwards as part of the national local government agreement?</p><p>Nanette Milne rightly highlighted the concerns around the recent announcement of a renewed focus on delayed discharge. She recognised that that has raised questions about whether proper consideration has been given to the impact and increased burden of care that might arise from hospitals pushing for discharge for people when both the individual and unpaid carers and families are not ready.</p><p>I ask the minister to ensure that carers are recognised as equal partners in care. Professionals in health and social care must change their attitude towards carers. Too often, carers are left with the feeling that they are expected to be grateful for what is offered and that when they challenge the way things are done they are considered just to be troublemakers. Will the Government commit to work with local authorities and health boards to introduce a short break entitlement for those who are in greatest need?</p><p>In my earlier contribution, I highlighted the vital role that organisations such as VSA and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers play in helping carers to manage the impact of caring on their lives. It is essential to draw on their knowledge, and they must be fully involved when change fund plans are considered. Many carers organisations, which are experts in identifying and working with carers, are still not getting to the table or are there only in a tokenistic way as partners consider their change fund plans. I am pleased to hear that the minister has issued guidance, and I am keen to hear how he will monitor compliance with it.</p><p>There are lots of challenges, but getting it right will mean that thousands of carers will be able to lead more balanced, healthier lives and there will be a reduction in crisis intervention costs.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655398", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers and Young Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been an important one in which members from all parties have given voice to carers&#8217; concerns.

Police forces such as Central Scotland Police and Grampian Police have seen the biggest reductions&#8212;the figures are 18 and 14 per cent respectively.</p><p>In addition to the many administrative posts that have been lost, a wide range of other jobs have been lost from police forces throughout Scotland, including crime intelligence analysts, police custody officers, community wardens, road safety officers, a firearms licensing manager, and wildlife and environmental crime officers. It is clear that police forces are losing a wealth of knowledge and expertise that, until now, was harnessed to help to cut and prevent crime in Scotland. That is a retrograde step.</p><p>Civilian staff fulfil an important role in helping to keep Scotland&#8217;s streets safe. They provide essential expertise and skills in the fight against crime, and they help to keep front-line police staff out on the streets protecting communities. A reduction in civilian numbers could lead to Scotland&#8217;s visible police force being rapidly eroded. I urge the Scottish Government to recognise that it is essential to maintain a balance between civilian staff and front-line officers, not just for their expertise, but for the fight against crime in communities. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice needs to explain how the Scottish Government will get the balance right, because the public will continue to be protected only through that being achieved.</p><p>During last year&#8217;s budget scrutiny, ACPOS warned that focusing purely on maintaining police officer numbers would result in police being taken off the beat to perform civilian staff functions. In evidence to the Justice Committee, Chief Constable David Strang said:</p><p>&#8220;If we reduce the number of front-line staff who do essential jobs, there is a real risk that we will have to remove police officers from other duties. For example, if we make custody officers redundant, we will have to release police officers to look after prisoners in police stations.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 23 November 2010; c 3815.]</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats are absolutely committed to keeping communities safe. We recognise that front-line civilian staff are an integral part of any modern police force. I agree with ACPOS that forces should have flexibility in the way that they deploy resources to maintain front-line policing.</p><p>However, let us be clear that the staffing reductions that I have mentioned will be only the tip of the iceberg if the cabinet secretary pursues his proposal for a single police force. The kind of savings that the Government claims would come from the creation of a single police force could be realised only through staff cuts that would lead to the loss of around 4,000 officers throughout Scotland.</p><p>Losses on that scale would put the current community focus of our police services under immense pressure. Chief Constable Colin McKerracher of Grampian Police has warned that it would risk a return to the crime-fighting, call-response mode of policing, in which officers run around answering calls for crimes that have occurred because they are no longer able to prevent them. Much good work would be lost, and the performance of which the Government has been so proud this morning would be jeopardised.</p><p>The Scottish Liberal Democrats believe that the most effective way of keeping communities safe is to ensure that our police services are properly resourced, locally accountable and flexible enough to respond to local needs and that policing remains part of the local government family. The development of close links between criminal justice services, social work services and education, drug and alcohol services has brought about great progress on tackling the root causes of crime.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654352", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Keeping Communities Safe"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I did indeed see that correspondence.

Lasting change needs to come from within our communities. Paragraph 36 of the committee report states:</p><p>&#8220;Evidence from organisations working with children and young people has underlined that both the problem and the solution start early. Attitudes towards &#8216;difference&#8217; and &#8216;otherness&#8217;&#8212;both negative and positive&#8212;are ingrained from an early age. Parents and other early-years role models have a crucial role to play in helping nurture positive attitudes and respect for difference. So does education.&#8221;</p><p>Law making should be a measured and considered process that takes our citizens with us through detailed scrutiny and evidence taking. It ought not to be driven by a desire to seize the headlines. The Scottish Parliament has built a reputation for being open and consultative. Our procedures have been widely recognised as a good way to do business&#8212;until now.</p><p>There has been widespread criticism of the something-must-be-done approach that the Scottish National Party has taken on the matter. It was wrong to try to legislate on such a complex matter with emergency legislation. That is the real root of the problem: hastily drafted legislation introduced in the first few weeks of a new Administration. I am glad that in June the First Minister was forced to back down and give ground, because it gave the Justice Committee time to have a limited consultation and evidence taking. That evidence has been reported to Parliament today, and our report exposes the extent of the dangers inherent in the bill.</p><p>I thank everyone who gave evidence to the committee and the clerks who assisted us so ably. We had many insightful contributions from organisations such as Nil by Mouth and Action for Children Scotland that have a great deal of knowledge about the impact of sectarianism. There were measured and thoughtful responses from scores of organisations and individuals representing a good cross-section of Scottish society. Is the Government really saying that their views count for nothing and that the only voices worth listening to are those of our police and prosecutors?</p><p>It is plain that the bill is ill thought out and will do little to address the underlying problems associated with sectarian behaviour. It strays blithely into restrictions on freedom of speech and verges on hate thought crime. Those are compelling reasons not to support the bill, which is why I am particularly annoyed that the minister chose to paint those opposed to it as obstructive and partisan. Scots rightly expect a much more constructive and reflective response from their Government when such fundamental issues are raised.</p><p>Only committee members who belonged to the Government party felt able to lend their qualified support to the bill. All the other committee members have concluded that it is unnecessary and unworkable and will have far-reaching and unintended consequences. They do not believe that the Scottish Government has made the case for the necessity of a new offence; instead, they believe that a more proportionate response to the problems in Scottish football would be to give more consideration to the use of existing laws, enforced effectively and combined with other non-legislative measures.</p><p>Members should note that in the past six months there has been a marked increase in prosecutions under the existing legislation for both sectarian chanting and internet abuse. The minister told the committee that the new offence will not tackle hugely different behaviour:</p><p>&#8220;we are turning breach of the peace into a more concrete offence so that people are clear about what is being tackled.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 21 June 2011; c 17.]</p><p>The evidence we heard contradicted that. Professor Devine said:</p><p>&#8220;the issue of offensive behaviour is by no means clear cut. Throughout the process, members have continually asked witnesses to define such terms and, in my personal view, the answers have been intellectually unconvincing.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 13 September 2011; c 242.]</p><p>The committee report is frank. Paragraph 148 says:</p><p>&#8220;uncertainty still surrounds some key issues&#8221;.</p><p>Paragraph 149 says:</p><p>&#8220;the Committee notes that it is also important to ensure that the legislation itself is robust&#8221;.</p><p>Paragraph 163 says:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee invites the Scottish Government to reflect on concerns that the &#8216;catch-all&#8217; test for offensive behaviour set out in section 1(2)(e) may be too expansive and may raise concerns in respect of adherence to freedom of speech&#8221;.</p><p>Paragraph 195 says:</p><p>&#8220;the Government should consider whether the parameters of the offence ... need to be made clearer&#8221;.</p><p>Finally, paragraph 196 asks</p><p>&#8220;whether there is scope to make the relevant provisions any more clear&#8221;.</p><p>The Government considers that the lack of clarity in the bill can be addressed by the Lord Advocate issuing guidance on how it should be interpreted. The trouble with that approach is that guidelines can change. Relying on that kind of soft law to clarify legislation is a dangerous road to go down. Scots deserve better and they have the right to understand what would constitute an offence.</p><p>The catch-all nature of section 1(2)(e) that refers to</p><p>&#8220;behaviour that a reasonable person would be likely to consider offensive&#8221;</p><p>has caused many to raise concerns, as have the religious hatred provisions. Shelagh McCall of the Scottish Human Rights Commission told the committee:</p><p>&#8220;Offensive speech is protected by article 10 of the European convention on human rights.

I am drawn immediately to the reference to</p><p>&#8220;restoring the High Court to its rightful place at the apex of&#8221;</p><p>the Scottish legal system. I agree that the High Court should remain as the final court of appeal in Scottish criminal cases, but the key word is &#8220;remain&#8221;. I do not believe that its position has ever been in doubt. There are certainly some issues about the precise way in which our legal system interacts with the Supreme Court and it is right that that relationship should be clarified. I will touch on those issues in a moment, but first I must again thank Lord McCluskey and his group for their work on the report. Hearing additional viewpoints to inform the debate is always helpful. However, I must repeat two points that I made in our debate on the initial report in June.</p><p>First, let us remember that the report was commissioned by the Government as an attempt to justify its intemperate comments towards the Supreme Court on the back of the Nat Fraser ruling. That the report has singularly failed to endorse the Government&#8217;s call that the Supreme Court should play no role in Scotland should serve as a reminder to both Kenny MacAskill and Alex Salmond that they ought to think a little before they shout. Secondly, I am still unsure why we seem to be giving the report the same weight and significance as the report of the Advocate General&#8217;s expert group, which was put together over many months on the back of evidence taking and discussions with a wide range of experts and interested parties.</p><p>That said, Lord McCluskey&#8217;s report raises a number of relevant issues. I am particularly interested in his recommendation that we widen the scope for referrals to the Supreme Court beyond the acts or omissions of the Lord Advocate and that appeal to the Supreme Court be open, regardless of which public authority is alleged to have violated a person&#8217;s convention rights. If a practical way can be found to incorporate such a change, the move seems eminently sensible. The Lord Advocate is not the sole point of contact for ensuring that accused people&#8217;s convention rights are protected and I hope that we can consider and discuss this issue further as the Scotland Bill progresses. I was interested to hear Kenny MacAskill support such a change earlier this afternoon. I am also content with the report&#8217;s recommendation that the Supreme Court remit cases in which it has found a convention breach right back to the High Court for it to determine the appropriate disposal.</p><p>However, I cannot agree with Lord McCluskey&#8217;s recommendation on certification. I recognise that this tricky issue merits debate but, so far, there have been inconsistencies in comparisons. It has been mentioned more than once that a system of certification already exists in England and Wales and Northern Ireland but, as members of the Advocate General&#8217;s expert group made clear in response to Lord McCluskey&#8217;s group, any such comparison is flawed because, in those jurisdictions, the Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for all aspects of criminal law. Of course, that is not the case in Scotland.</p><p>The Advocate General&#8217;s group also noted the many exceptions to the certification system that are in place in the rest of the UK.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653571", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Criminal Law (Integrity)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the opportunity to debate the review group&#8217;s report and set it in the context of the wider debate.

It is all very well for the cabinet secretary and the First Minister to be outraged that a &#8220;foreign court&#8221; is &#8220;undermining&#8221; Scots criminal law with its decisions. However, what I am outraged by&#8212;and what this Government should be outraged by&#8212;is the fact that our laws still have flaws that allow people's human rights to be impinged on in the first place.</p><p>As I said back in June, the perception remains that engagement with the ECHR tends to focus on criminal cases and that, therefore, it is a means of protecting the criminal classes. However, such a perception is not the reality, and nor should it be used as an excuse not to take action to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s laws are compatible with the convention. I firmly believe that the Scottish Government must heed the Law Society&#8217;s calls for a full review of Scottish criminal law and procedure to determine its compatibility with the ECHR.</p><p>I am very concerned that there remains a distinct air of &#8220;wha&#8217;s like us?&#8221; in the Government&#8217;s approach to this whole issue. Enshrining and protecting human rights in our laws should be a basic principle of government. However, when discussing concerns about potential human rights implications of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill, the Lord Advocate appeared to be of the view that the law would be compliant, simply because he</p><p>&#8220;cannot act in a way that is incompatible with ... the ECHR.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 20 September 2011; c 302.]</p><p>Ensuring the protection of human rights is far more complicated than that.

The measured tones of Kenny MacAskill&#8217;s opening speech were in stark contrast to his tawdry language earlier this year, which showed much disrespect to the Supreme Court, its judges and our legal system itself.</p><p>It should be a matter of great concern to everyone when ministers who play a role in our judicial system launch attacks on judges and their judgments. Respect for the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental responsibility of Government, so I hope that ministers will take that duty a bit more seriously in the future. I remind Mr MacAskill, who has just returned to the chamber, that it is never too late to say sorry. It was a bit rich to hear members being lectured by Mr MacAskill today on the appropriate demeanour for the debate.</p><p>The idea that the independence of Scots law is under threat is simply wrong. The fact remains that only a tiny number of cases every year go to the Supreme Court. The High Court remains Scotland&#8217;s highest criminal court. Surely, the main issue that we should be concerned with is not where the Cadder ruling or the Nat Fraser ruling were made; we should be far more worried about the deficiencies&#8212;if there are any&#8212;in our criminal law and the procedures that are creating doubts over the legitimacy of the convictions in the first place. Those and other recent cases have not been examples of a foreign court imposing itself on Scottish criminal proceedings; rather, they have been a warning that we need to look closely at our body of law and to review exactly how it sits in relation to ECHR responsibilities.</p><p>The only time criminal proceedings from Scotland reach the Supreme Court is when there is a devolution issue&#8212;typically, when it is alleged that there has been a breach of the ECHR by a Scottish minister. We need to keep the matter in context. In May 2011, Justice pointed out:</p><p>&#8220;Since the Human Rights Act and the Scotland Act came into force, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and subsequently the Supreme Court, have only heard twenty two cases, of which five were brought by the Crown. This number produced an average of two or three cases a year. ... Of these cases, fourteen were dismissed, limiting the ability of bringing similar points back before the Court. Only eight appeals were allowed, four of which were in favour of the Crown. There is no evidence from these appeals and the judgments handed down that the Supreme Court has extended its jurisdiction or heard cases it ought not to. Indeed it appears to us that the Supreme Court operates entirely within its special jurisdiction, and appropriately respects the position of the High Court of Justiciary.&#8221;</p><p>That is a quote from a submission by Justice following the Advocate General&#8217;s further call for evidence in May 2011.</p><p>On the real point of substance, both the Advocate General&#8217;s expert group and the McCluskey review group recommend that there remain a right of appeal to the Supreme Court on human rights grounds in Scottish criminal cases.</p><p>On certification, there is not only little support for it, but some bemusement about why the matter has been raised at all.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653571", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Criminal Law (Integrity)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is no surprise that the debate has taken the route that it has done.

I understand that tough decisions will always need to be made in the area. Weighing up effectiveness against resources is an extremely difficult task, and it must be done in a rigorous and scrupulously objective way. It may well be that the criteria that are used to make those decisions need to be examined to see whether they disadvantage drugs that are designed to treat rare diseases, but the Scottish Liberal Democrats do not agree with the argument that we should bypass the Scottish Medicines Consortium for cancer drugs. That argument is intellectually unsound, unsustainable and unfair for people who suffer from other conditions. Politicians should not second guess the SMC.</p><p>Like Macmillan Cancer Support, Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Myeloma UK, we do not support the creation of a separate cancer drugs fund. The SMC&#8217;s role is to make objective decisions about individual drugs, and recent initiatives should be given a chance to demonstrate their efficacy. Cancer Research UK has admitted that the bigger prize is the achievement of a decent settlement in negotiations about value-based pricing. I urge the Scottish Government to engage with the UK Government to ensure that the new scheme meets the needs of patients in Scotland.</p><p>The evidence that we have seen is that record keeping in NHS boards is still poor. Nearly two thirds of NHS boards do not hold information about the costs associated with funding exceptional prescribing applications. I would like to see that change. In order to help to make progress, the Government must increase transparency throughout the system and should consider commissioning research into what factors contribute to situations in which drugs are seen to be safe and effective but not cost effective and clinically evidenced.</p><p>One step that the cabinet secretary outlined in 2009 was the introduction of a set of modifiers that the SMC can apply when considering new medicines. Has an assessment been made of the impact that that more flexible approach is having on access? Have, as a result of the modifiers, any drugs been approved that would not have been approved under the standard methodology?</p><p>We seek a much greater contribution from the pharmaceutical industry, which should work with the Scottish Government to encourage patient access schemes and risk-sharing approaches. In our manifesto, we focused on improving early detection rates to increase survival and we set out plans for a new target on urgent referral for cancer diagnosis: every patient should expect to see a specialist within two weeks. We must focus on increasing early detection in order to tackle the unacceptably high number of cancer cases that are detected for the first time only during emergency admission to hospital. The subject is emotive, but it benefits from the calm and impartial consideration that the SMC can bring.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-00956.1, to leave out from &#8220;through&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;and that patients in Scotland are now three times less likely than patients in England to gain access to a cancer medicine that is not routinely available; notes that the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy made a statement to the Parliament on 25 March 2009, outlining three steps being taken to improve access to new medicines, during which she said &#8220;All the developments that I have announced today will, individually and collectively, improve patients&#8217; access to medicines on the NHS&#8221;; recognises that an earlier RCF report, The Scottish Exception?

We know that the SMC is actually quite responsive. The cabinet secretary reminded us that the SMC reviews all new drugs, while NICE reviews only a selection. It is easier for the system to be more responsive in such a small country, but Jackie Baillie rightly questioned the geographical variations in the approach of area drug and therapeutics committees and whether they are putting a brake on the system. I support her request for a review of that, which seems a sensible suggestion.</p><p>I re-emphasise the need to invest in early detection. Alex Johnstone referred the fact that our outcomes are poorer when compared with those in the rest of Europe, but I agree with the comments of most other members on the need to focus on early detection. That is the way to drive down that problem. At the moment, too many cancers are detected only during unplanned admissions.</p><p>The truth is that at the heart of the debate is a question of fairness. I do not mean to sound harsh&#8212;I understand the suffering caused by these dreadful illnesses&#8212;but I really do not understand why medicines for one particular set of illnesses should be exempted from the process of balancing clinical effectiveness with health economics. Dennis Robertson among many others echoed that point, drawing attention to the needs of stroke patients, heart patients and those with MS.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies could do much more to bring drugs into the mainstream more quickly, and the value-based pricing approach that is being developed in Westminster should open up access to more drugs more quickly by factoring in more considerations.

Mental health problems place enormous burdens on individuals, their families and the Scottish economy. Mental health is not just an NHS issue; it is at the core of Scotland&#8217;s wellbeing. Without action to improve it, action on education, employment, criminal justice and poverty will fail.</p><p>In our manifesto, we committed to bringing forward a comprehensive and ambitious new mental health strategy for Scotland to tackle the problem across all age groups. It is therefore very welcome that the Scottish Government is also now consulting on a new strategy.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s emphasis on encouraging people to take responsibility for their own mental health is sensible, but it will succeed only if personalisation and joint working between agencies become a reality and new ways of delivering services are promoted. My amendment addresses the need to recognise that and I hope that all parties will support it.</p><p>The new strategy should also recognise that, although specialist mental health services play a key role, they should not take a referral to a mental health team before an individual can discuss their mental health. We want a more holistic approach, less reliance on drug therapies and greater priority given to the provision of mental health services across all age groups.</p><p>We must ensure that those who are affected by mental health problems have access to the help that they need in the community. Improving the provision of services by increasing the access to psychological and emotional support and reducing waiting times should be a priority. Investing in prevention and mental wellbeing, rather than focusing on treating severe and enduring mental illness, will be effective in the longer term.</p><p>Some of my earliest casework involved waiting times for mental health services for children, and I am still shocked that children and young people are likely to face a staggering wait for access to such services. Like Richard Simpson, I acknowledge the progress that the Government has made. However, a child&#8217;s mental distress is felt across the family and can have significant repercussions on other siblings&#8217; behaviour, so I would like the Government&#8217;s target of a 26-week referral for CAMHS by March 2013 to be even more ambitious.</p><p>The Scottish Government must increase access to psychological therapies. It must take steps to increase the number of qualified psychologists in order to tackle long waiting times and the variations in provision in different NHS board areas. It should also work with voluntary organisations to explore the capacity in the voluntary sector to provide more people with faster access to psychological therapies and emotional support.</p><p>I want more community-based support services to be available, so that GPs can refer people to local services rather than reach for the prescription pad. Many GPs do not feel confident about providing information on mental health, so I ask the Government to ensure that the strategy includes a commitment to offer them continuing professional development opportunities in positive mental health.</p><p>Although more than 10 per cent of Scots make daily use of antidepressants&#8212;a worrying statistic&#8212;individuals&#8217; treatment is not regularly reviewed to ensure that antidepressants are still the best way to help them to recover. It should be made clear that people who receive mental health treatment, particularly drug treatment, should have regular reviews to ensure that there is a focus on recovery.</p><p>Suicide is devastating and leaves its mark for generations. It continues to be a leading cause of death among people under 35. Although progress has been made, there is still a way to go. Ending the silence around it, reducing the stigma of mental illness and building an understanding that responsibility for prevention reaches far beyond the health service will all help in the short term. In the longer term, fostering self-esteem and mental resilience in our young people will pay dividends.</p><p>When the state has a direct role, it must lead by example. Whether for looked-after children, those who receive compulsory treatment, dementia patients in hospital or prisoners, much more that can be done must be done. I support Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland, which has called on the Government to ensure that the children and young people who are at greater risk of mental health problems, such as looked-after children and young offenders, are identified, supported into services and provided with treatment.</p><p>The Equal Opportunities Committee reported earlier this year that it was deeply concerned about the lack of advocacy for prisoners with mental disorders. It believes that their legal entitlement to advocacy is failing to be delivered. It was chilling to read the recent report on Cornton Vale by Her Majesty&#8217;s chief inspector of prisons. I will quote briefly from it:</p><p>&#8220;Nowhere is the mental health issue more stark than in the euphemistically-named &#8216;Management Suite&#8217; in Ross House. This segregation area is more colloquially known as the &#8216;back cells&#8217;. These cells are utterly depressing and are an unsuitable environment in which to hold very vulnerable girls and women. It is my view that these cells are used primarily as a control measure. Staff are insufficiently trained to deal with the women held there.</p><p>I conclude that the treatment of vulnerable women with mental health issues must improve.&#8221;</p><p>I urge the minister to discuss that with his colleague the Cabinet Secretary for Justice.</p><p>The Mental Welfare Commission&#8217;s &#8220;Not properly authorised&#8221; report highlighted significant failings in the proper authorisation of, and obtaining of consent to, medication for those who receive compulsory treatment. Its &#8220;Starved of Care&#8221; report, which we discussed in the Parliament, described the treatment of Mrs V, an 80-year-old patient at Ninewells hospital, as degrading and unnecessary and said that it may have breached her human rights. Those examples underline how far we still have to go to ensure that people who have mental health problems are treated with dignity and respect. Ending the stigma and discrimination that currently exist around mental health problems, improving access to good, responsive community-based mental health services and fostering a nation of people with good self-esteem and mental resilience are among the best investments that we could make.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-00949.1, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;and believes that, in moving forward, greater personalisation, better joint working and a focus on prevention and mental wellbeing are key to achieving better, more efficient services.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "One in four adults will experience mental ill health in their lifetime.

We stress that a holistic approach is essential. Integrated services, investment in community-based solutions and greater personalisation will ensure that we make best use of scarce resources. We must also drive down waiting times for access to psychological services.</p><p>It is clear that local health and care services are not nearly sufficiently joined up. A SAMH survey found that, on average, each service user was receiving services from 14 different agencies. That cannot be a good use of resources, and it leads to poorer levels of care for individuals.</p><p>The spending review sees the mental wellbeing budget remain unchanged at, I think, &#163;6 million a year.

It will be difficult to deliver improvements to mental health services against that backdrop, so it is all the more important to clarify what the priorities are and to ensure that resources are invested wisely. It would be useful to learn from the minister what discussions, if any, he has had with councils on this vital service area under the single outcome agreements.</p><p>There were many good speeches. Mary Scanlon detailed in great depth the economic and social impacts of mental health problems. That was a useful pen picture to have at the start of the debate. She also spoke highly of the role of social enterprises in the provision of mental health services. I echo her support for that.</p><p>Dennis Robertson also spoke about social enterprises and the need for training to ensure that staff in care homes, hospitals and prisons know what the mental health issues are. That is an important message.</p><p>George Adam spoke about a lot of small, local projects, real people and how we can make a real difference locally.</p><p>Mary Fee echoed some of the comments that I made about looked-after children. We must not lose sight of the problems with them.</p><p>Siobhan McMahon spoke eloquently about the need for preventive action. We have heard that call echoed around the chamber this afternoon, and we need to press for that.</p><p>John Wilson was the only person to note that we need to support families and carers.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale&#8212;who, as always, made an insightful speech&#8212;challenged us to look behind addiction at how the state fails people and how we can start to address those problems.</p><p>There is no doubt that mental health services are ripe for spend-to-save initiatives. Prevention must be part of any new strategy. High-risk groups, such as looked-after children and young offenders, must be given more support. Vulnerable people who have no voice&#8212;those with dementia and those in prison&#8212;need us to stand up for them. Advocacy services must be readily available. In all our communities, there are people who will need to access mental health services at some point in their life, so we must ensure that, when they seek help, the help that is on offer is person centred, easily accessed, effective and timeous.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This afternoon&#8217;s debate has been timely and worth while and I think that the minister will take heart from its consensual tone.

Respecting the judiciary&#8217;s independence is a fundamental responsibility of the Government, and I hope that ministers will take that duty more seriously in the future.</p><p>The truly disappointing aspect of the debate is that the intemperate comments from Mr Salmond and Mr MacAskill have served only to distract us from the real issue at hand. The main issue that we should be concerned with is not where the Cadder or Nat Fraser ruling was made; we should be far more worried about the deficiencies in our criminal law and procedures that are creating doubts about the legitimacy of convictions in the first place. Those cases and other recent cases have not been examples of a foreign court imposing itself into Scottish criminal proceedings; rather, they have been a warning that we need to look closely at our body of law and review exactly how it sits in relation to our ECHR responsibilities.</p><p>In its briefing for this debate, Amnesty International rightly pointed out that</p><p>&#8220;It is unfortunate that most public, or even political, engagement with the ECHR centres around criminal cases&#8221;,</p><p>with the consequent</p><p>&#8220;assumption that human rights exist principally to benefit&#8221;</p><p>the criminal classes. That perception of the ECHR is not the reality, of course, but it lingers and in many ways makes the discussion about how it should work in relation to Scots law more difficult.

Although, as I said, we are all grateful for the speed at which the group has worked to meet another of the Government&#8217;s needlessly rushed deadlines, that speed has necessarily come at the expense of full consideration. For example, I am forced to wonder why we seem to be giving the report the same weight and significance as the Advocate General&#8217;s expert group&#8217;s report.

I support her motion. The Government&#8217;s proposal to transfer the role of the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman fails to recognise the specific and unique nature of handling police complaints. For our police complaints procedure to be credible and trusted by the public, it must be visible, independent and well resourced. I commend the PCCS for the way in which it does its work.</p><p>The legacy paper from the previous parliamentary session&#8217;s Justice Committee highlighted the matter as something that its successor committee should scrutinise; I hope that that will be possible.</p><p>Scottish Liberal Democrats are concerned about the proposals to transfer the role to the SPSO and question whether those proposals are necessary or desirable. As Margaret Mitchell said, police complaints require specific expertise and understanding for proper handling, and we are concerned that the generalist experience of the SPSO is not best suited to that.</p><p>It is vital that the Scottish Government consider the unique role that is played by the PCCS at the moment. I would be concerned if the merger was driven by nothing more than a desire on the Government&#8217;s part to reduce the number of public bodies to meet some arbitrary target. We know that the current commissioner, Professor John McNeill, has said that handing his role to a general body could damage public confidence and would be regressive. He has argued that continuing down that path would leave Scotland alone in the UK in not having a dedicated police complaints oversight body.</p><p>Trust in the police and the willingness of the public to engage constructively with them depend on the powers of the police being exercised reasonably and in accordance with the law. An effective system of complaints oversight is vital to the accountability and transparency of the police. There must be an effective mechanism by which the public can seek to hold the police to account.</p><p>As we have heard, the Scottish Human Rights Commission argues that the independent oversight of policing plays a vital role in protecting individual human rights, ensuring public trust and confidence in the police and promoting the efficient operation of law enforcement in Scotland. Those three different aspects operate together to bring about an effective oversight of policing.</p><p>The current PCCS argues:</p><p>&#8220;The uniqueness of complaints about the police requires that the oversight mechanism is not only independent of the police, but also dedicated and specialised.&#8221;</p><p>We agree. The distinction between complaints about the police and those about other public bodies was recognised by Her Majesty&#8217;s inspectorate of constabulary in 2000 and by the previous Scottish Public Services Ombudsman in 2005. What is different now?</p><p>The Scottish National Party seems set to centralise Scotland&#8217;s police forces into a single force and Scottish Liberal Democrats are the only party that is standing up for local policing. We argue that it is bad for democracy to have a single chief constable responsible to the justice minister. Within that context, it seems even more vital to uphold an effective and independent accountability structure. A number of concerns were raised during the Government&#8217;s short consultation of stakeholders. Margaret Mitchell highlighted how inadequate that consultation process was.</p><p>HM chief inspector of constabulary raised concerns that the skills that are required to review complaints would be diluted within the much larger pool of complaints that SPSO deals with, and called for the issue to be considered in the wider context of police reform.</p><p>The Scottish Human Rights Commission has also raised concerns and the Scottish Information Commissioner has expressed concern that because of differences in the way freedom of information laws apply to the two bodies, transferring functions may have the unintended consequence of reducing the public&#8217;s right to scrutinise the conduct of investigations into police complaints.</p><p>Given the number of misgivings that have been voiced this evening during the debate, I urge the Government to tread very carefully. Changes to the police complaints procedure should be made only if there is a compelling case for change; that case has not been made. It is not enough to argue that the public would benefit from a one-stop shop for public service complaints or that budget savings need to be made.

I welcome the work that is being done with the joint action group on football, and look forward to reading its final report and seeing what recommendations it makes on what can be done to prevent a repeat of the dreadful scenes that we saw earlier this year. Sadly, such scenes have been a fact of life in Scotland for more than 100 years. However, I am forced to ask why the Government went to the trouble of setting up the joint action group if it is not willing to wait and hear what it has to say. Yesterday, The Scotsman opined that the</p><p>&#8220;Unseemly rush leaves Scots law open to ridicule&#8221;.</p><p>Not one member is saying that sectarian behaviour or any abusive or prejudiced behaviour should be tolerated, but such behaviour is already illegal. The bill, which the Government would prefer no one to look at too closely, will not criminalise anything that is not already illegal.

I still want the questions answered, and the people of Scotland deserve to have them answered. Therefore, I will ask the minister those questions.</p><p>What evidence is there that there are gaps in our existing laws that need to be closed? How many people have committed crimes aggravated by religious prejudice but have not been punished because our existing laws do not cover the offences? Could the scenes that we witnessed earlier this year have been prevented if existing laws were enforced more consistently? How many prosecutions could be brought under the new offences? How many of those prosecutions could not be made under the current law?

The current facilities are utterly failing women prisoners and the cabinet secretary ought to take personal responsibility for ensuring that improvements are made swiftly.

He might be right, but I say to him that we need to see the evidence. Are there gaps? Just a month ago, the then Solicitor General for Scotland, Frank Mulholland, issued a press release welcoming the high prosecution rate for crimes of religious prejudice.

The recent, shocking cases that involved Ninewells hospital and the Elsie Inglis nursing home raised serious concerns about the care of elderly patients. For too long there have been different levels of support in Scotland. The problem needs to be remedied urgently and providers who fail the vulnerable individuals who are in their care must be shut down. The cabinet secretary&#8217;s recent pledge to make the issue a personal priority is welcome. The recent cases, along with Audit Scotland&#8217;s recent findings, illustrate the scale of the challenge that she faces, but I do not doubt that she will strive to meet the challenge.</p><p>Liberal Democrats think that healthcare should be delivered as locally as possible and that better joint working is vital if we are to bridge the gap between health and social care. Earlier this year, NHS Grampian&#8217;s medical director warned that unless we change how health services, local authorities and individuals work together,</p><p>&#8220;the way things are now, every year from now, Scotland will have to build a new hospital with around 600 beds to be able to cope. Every single person leaving school will have to find a job within the NHS to be able to provide enough care for the elderly.&#8221;</p><p>Audit Scotland, in its highly critical report, &#8220;Review of Community Health Partnerships&#8221;, also expressed serious doubts about the drive for greater integration of health and social care&#8212;although it has been clear in this morning&#8217;s debate that that is what we must strive for. Audit Scotland found that there is a chaotic and &#8220;cluttered partnership landscape&#8221; and it called for a &#8220;fundamental review&#8221; of CHPs, which are failing to have a positive impact on local people&#8217;s quality of life.</p><p>Delayed discharges are rising again, so more people are waiting longer to be discharged from hospital. Given that a week in hospital costs &#163;3,349 on average, breakdowns in local co-operation are hugely costly as well as bad for patients. It is also clear that people are not receiving the support that they need if they are to stay out of hospital and in the community. Multiple emergency admissions of older people are increasing, as Mary Scanlon said, and there has been mixed progress on reducing emergency admissions for people with long-term conditions such as angina.</p><p>The British Medical Association has called the CHPs &#8220;bureaucratic monoliths&#8221;, and in many areas general practitioners have completely disengaged from them. We need to see proper joined-up working between local partners, and GPs must be brought back to the heart of those local partnerships. However, work to integrate health and social care must reflect local circumstances, and we would oppose any efforts to centralise services or to impose a one-size-fits-all approach. The Government has been quiet about transferring 38,000 local authority social services staff into the NHS since it mentioned it in February; the proposals were met with anger from COSLA, which branded them incompetent. The Government&#8217;s evidence review found that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work. We will therefore continue to oppose any moves towards centralising services in a national body. The issue surely cries out for a local solution and not a centralised organisation with little local accountability and enormous costs and bureaucracy.</p><p>Better partnership working must be backed up by a genuine shift in the balance of care into the community. However, Audit Scotland reported that there has been no large-scale shift in the balance of care. We can all see that locally and know that it has not yet happened. Social care remains focused on institutional settings. More than 60 per cent of Scottish Government spending on care for older people is on care in hospitals and care homes, and almost one third is on emergency or unelected hospital admissions, amounting to around &#163;1.4&#160;billion a year.

We will protect free personal care, which is a proud achievement of our time in government.

Care homes cost around &#163;600 a week per individual, while the average weekly cost of a personal care package can be less than &#163;120.

NHS staff are a credit to Scotland&#8217;s health service. However, as the cabinet secretary said, enormous challenges for the future still face the health service, particularly from the growing elderly population and from Scotland&#8217;s obesity epidemic, and the Scottish Government must set out long-term plans to tackle them. Although we have heard much from ministers about spending to save and preventative action, just this week Sir John Elvidge warned that the Government&#8217;s current spending plans are unsustainable and that much more focus needs to be placed on outcomes than on political targets. We know that Scotland&#8217;s health service is about more than targets and statistical inputs. Joined-up thinking, cutting out waste and smart investment in preventative care will all improve the long-term health of the nation and the care that patients receive in their communities.</p><p>Liberal Democrats believe that healthcare should be delivered as locally as possible. Despite all the rhetoric on shifting the balance of care, most spending is still directed towards acute services. People are being cared for in hospitals, often miles from their home, when they would receive better and more cost-effective care in the community, so it is deeply concerning that Audit Scotland has produced such a damning report on the bodies that were intended to drive local delivery and the integration of health and social care.</p><p>The fact that the quality of community health partnerships is extremely variable&#8212;some are little more than large and unwieldy talking shops&#8212;seems to have led to GPs disengaging completely from CHPs in many areas. We simply cannot understand how it is possible to have a CHP without the involvement of GPs, who are the main providers of healthcare in the community. It is clear that local health and care services are not nearly sufficiently connected. A recent SAMH survey found that, on average, each of its service users received services from 14 different agencies.

Advances in treatment and higher awareness mean that more people are surviving longer and cancer treatment waiting times have reduced, but Scotland&#8217;s cancer survival rates still lag behind those of the best-performing countries in the world. We need to make earlier detection of cancer a priority for the NHS. The SNP has set out plans in that area, but it must work to tackle the unacceptably high number of cancer cases that are detected for the first time only on emergency admission to hospital.</p><p>In addition, preventative action needs to be taken to tackle obesity. The majority of Scots are overweight or obese, and the number of people who suffer from high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and heart disease is likely to soar over the coming years. Scotland&#8217;s recent progress on reducing levels of heart disease could be overturned and the gains that have been made in reducing mortality through the reduction in smoking reversed. Scotland is no longer the heart disease capital of the western world, and we would like to keep it that way.</p><p>The country&#8217;s alcohol problem is another key public health challenge that faces us. The SNP has said that it will introduce a minimum pricing bill and, this week, our party has signalled a change to our approach to the issue. We will work constructively with the Government to make the bill the best that it can be.</p><p>However, minimum pricing will not be the whole answer. We will also need to see much more stringent enforcement of the current law, especially when it comes to selling alcohol to drunk people and underage young people. Early intervention measures to tackle cycles of dependency and better access to treatment are key, too. The Scottish Government needs to take those measures far more seriously than it has done. Ultimately, efforts need to be made to focus on changing the damaging culture of drinking to excess and to raise awareness of the fact that many of Scotland&#8217;s drinkers are failing to recognise that they are consuming alcohol in quantities that are damaging to health. That will require broad action across society, and I acknowledge that minimum pricing should be part of that action.</p><p>One in four adults will experience mental ill health in their lifetimes. Mental health problems place enormous burdens on individuals, their families and the Scottish economy. Mental health is not just an NHS issue; it is at the core of Scotland&#8217;s wellbeing. Without action to improve mental health, action on education, employment, criminal justice and poverty will all fail. We would like to see a more holistic approach, less reliance on drug therapies, and greater priority given to provision of mental health services across all age groups. We must ensure that those affected by mental health problems have access to the help that they need in the community.

In fact, he could not even garner enough support to take forward a member&#8217;s bill on the subject beyond the preliminary stage. That constant harking back only distracts from the real issues. The Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 contains adequate provision for statutory quality partnerships and quality contracts. The fact that those mechanisms have not been much used suggests to me that local authorities find a collaborative approach to be much more fruitful. I am also pretty sure that local authorities are mindful of the costs that would befall them from intervention in the market.</p><p>We can easily find examples of innovation and success in the bus industry throughout Scotland, with the possible exception of parts of Glasgow. If the Labour Party and its representatives on regional and local transport authorities in Glasgow had spent a fraction of the time and effort that they have expended in the past decade on trying to get support for reregulation on actually working with the bus industry, we would have seen a step change in bus services in Glasgow.</p><p>In Scotland, we have the benefit of world-class, home-grown bus operators in FirstBus, Stagecoach and Lothian Buses, besides many good local independent operators. The most effective and lasting improvements to the bus network have come from partnership working that has involved the industry, local authorities, regional transport partnerships and the Government. Where councils foster a supportive environment, we find evidence of the commercial market growing the network. For example, Stagecoach and National Express are partners with Dundee City Council and Angus Council in a bus punctuality improvement partnership, and Renfrewshire Council, South Ayrshire Council and Glasgow City Council are all working with operators to create statutory quality partnerships, which will see all parties committing to improving the services and bus infrastructure that are available to the travelling public. The City of Edinburgh Council and Lothian Buses recently completed a pioneering scheme that involved older vehicles being retrofitted with exhaust technology that markedly improved their emissions levels.</p><p>The provision of first-class, flexible bus services involves a package of measures, and is as much about what happens off as on the buses. The improvements that are rightly expected from the industry, such as in modern buses, value-for-money fares, consistency and reliability, must be supported by public investment in infrastructure, whether that is in measures to ensure that buses do not get caught up in congestion, park-and-ride schemes or up-to-the-minute timetabling information. Innovation and investment from bus companies must be matched by commitment and investment from local and national Government.</p><p>I am not pretending that everyone has the bus services that they would like. Bus routes have been cancelled and fares have risen. In response to local concerns, I conducted a bus survey in rural Aberdeenshire recently and found clear evidence of inadequate services. My response to that was not to call for the reregulation of the bus industry; rather, it was to meet local operators, the local council and even local social enterprises to see what improvements could be made. The early indications are that some improvements could be brought in.</p><p>Few, if any, local authorities would relish taking on the task of the wholesale planning and funding of local bus services. We all know already of councils that are cutting back on their supported bus services because of the financial pressures that they face. The truth is that a cheque book would help, not the statute book.</p><p>Of course there are gaps in the market, but much more could be done within the existing framework to encourage the greater take-up of bus services. In a recent inquiry, the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee considered the relationship between transport and land use planning and made a number of sensible suggestions on future developments. The Government&#8217;s report on proposals and policies, which we discussed yesterday, notes that greater focus on travel planning would make a difference. Larger employers should work closely with bus operators to identify commuting and working hours patterns to help to trial new services.</p><p>Greater attention to passenger priority measures would allow operators to use their resources better to provide a greater network of services. Resources are unnecessarily tied up in dealing with the impacts of congestion in our towns and cities. In some parts of Scotland, overall journey times have increased by as much as 12.5 per cent in the past five years. That increases bus companies&#8217; operating costs without generating additional fares income. It disappoints me that, in Aberdeen, which is in my region, no new bus priority measures have been introduced for many years. That has meant longer journey times for passengers and higher operational costs for bus operators. Stagecoach reports that an extra seven buses are required to maintain service reliability because of congestion in Aberdeen city centre, at an additional cost of about &#163;650,000 a year. Surely that money could be better spent on developing new routes or more frequent services.</p><p>The Government has been, at best, ambivalent about the bus industry. In the early years, it cut the BSOG and had lengthy wrangles over the concessionary fares reimbursement formula. It ended the rural transport fund, hindering rural communities in finding local solutions. Community transport and demand-responsive transport must be recognised as essential partners in providing a joined-up bus network. The bus route development scheme was abolished, despite having been successful at growing markets.

I do not see that as progress.</p><p>Of all the problems that a national police force could bring, three worry me most. The first is governance and local accountability. I am deeply concerned about damage to front-line services and breaking the link with our local communities. A one-size-fits-all approach to our emergency services, with remote headquarters, would give bureaucrats&#8212;in the central belt, most likely&#8212;too much power, without enough awareness of local circumstances and issues. Currently, police forces are autonomous and accountable to local communities. They are free to decide how best to deploy resources and to set their own priorities within a national framework.</p><p>A national force would mean that local priorities would be lost. To whom would a national police force be accountable? Would it be accountable to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice? A single police force that was responsible politically to the justice minister would be unsatisfactory. There would be a great risk that political concerns rather than local priorities would dominate. Would a national police force be accountable to a board with perhaps one representative for the whole of Grampian? That would surely be wholly unacceptable to citizens of a modern, diverse Scotland.</p><p>The second issue is the loss of horizontal integration with other local services. Policing is rightly part of the local government family. The development of close links between criminal justice, social work, education, drug and alcohol services and the fire service, even, means that we have seen great progress on tackling the root causes of crime. The prevention and detection of crime are not aided by isolating the police and moving the key decision makers a couple of hundred miles down the road to Glasgow.</p><p>The chief constable of Grampian Police currently chairs the north-east of Scotland child protection committee and is an active and welcome member of many other strategic groups in the region. Grampian&#8217;s strategic co-ordinating group, which was set up to build the region&#8217;s resilience, is successful because the people who are currently round the table are in a position to commit all the resources of their organisations to any particular problem. The chief constable of a national police force would not sit on each resilience board or each community planning partnership. As a result, we would see a less responsive local service and a disintegration of services.</p><p>The Government set up the Christie commission to consider the future of the public sector. It is inexplicable that two key community planning partners&#8212;the police and the fire and rescue services&#8212;have been unplugged from that review. That demonstrates either a lack of understanding of the role of a modern police force or a lack of respect for it.</p><p>Finally, would Grampian get a fair share of resources from a national police force? The region has never yet received a fair share of funding from central Government. We are always struggling to cope with less than the national average. Centralising the force would lead only to greater problems in resourcing. It is likely that we would see our police numbers cut and resources being drawn to the centre, which would surely impact on safety and detection.</p><p>In conclusion, the proposals pose the greatest challenge to our local police service for a generation, and they would be disastrous for the north-east.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22645956", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Grampian Police"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The truth is that making savings of that sort would mean the loss of around 4,000 officers.

The soaring prices are causing a headache for households and businesses right across my region. The cost of fuel is a particularly heavy burden for those in rural Scotland.

We wrote our rural fuel discount policy into our election manifesto. Danny Alexander then won support for it in the coalition agreement and he has announced that the UK Government is taking it forward. It has to persuade the European Commission that the proposals are justified on the basis of evidence and then secure the approval of every one of the 27 member states. The plan will deliver up to a 5p duty discount on a litre of fuel. The pilot will start in the Inner and Outer Hebrides and the northern isles.

I am grateful to them all.</p><p>How can we keep the daily commute convenient and door-to-door yet also cut costs, congestion and carbon? There is one simple but often overlooked answer&#8212;lift sharing. I will use this debate to highlight the benefits of lift sharing. I believe that encouraging car sharing and other more sustainable transport options can play a key part in helping the transport sector to meet its share of Scotland&#8217;s climate change reduction targets.</p><p>We know that the transport sector is one of the big carbon emitters and that more than two thirds of its emissions come from road transport. Although I am glad that there has been steadily growing interest in sustainable transport solutions, I am surprised that one of the simplest and most effective solutions often seems to be overlooked. There is a lack of awareness at the Government level of the role that lift sharing already plays in the mobility mix and its potential to help to overcome many transport issues. It can be especially useful in rural areas, where public transport options are often few and far between.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s recently published draft report on proposals and policies in relation to climate change makes no reference to the promotion of car sharing, yet increasing its take-up could be one fairly quick and effective solution that is worth pursuing. I have already written to the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure about that omission, and I urge him to establish a clear strategy to determine how lift sharing can be encouraged across Scotland.</p><p>The good thing about lift sharing&#8212;or car sharing or car pooling, as it is also known&#8212;is that it is not just another worthy scheme but one that has an instant effect on people&#8217;s wallets. With petrol prices rising by the week and, according to the RAC Foundation, the looming threat of the &#163;8 gallon, the time is ripe to raise awareness of the benefits of car sharing.</p><p>Car sharing is a fairly instant way for people to cut their fuel costs. If they find three other people, they pay to go to work only once every four days. In my region, where commutes routinely involve a 40-mile round trip, that is quite a saving. Car sharing is an attractive alternative to single-occupant vehicle travel because of its door-to-door directness and convenience. Aside from the financial savings that are to be made, the main benefit of car sharing is that each person in the car&#8212;other than the driver, obviously&#8212;potentially represents a vehicle trip removed from the road.</p><p>Car sharing reduces travel costs. The average person who shares their daily trip saves around &#163;900 a year. It reduces car traffic, congestion and parking issues. It reduces emissions, of course&#8212;the average person who shares their daily trip saves around 1 tonne of CO2 a year. It improves access and reduces exclusion, because for many people there are not always convenient, viable or affordable alternatives to car travel. It also increases social interaction. Interestingly, it improves road safety. Research has shown that people who share cars are 50 per cent less likely to have an accident.</p><p>Membership of liftshare, the United Kingdom-wide car-sharing network has now exceeded 400,000, through the operation of 1,346 car-sharing schemes. Liftshare, which is a social enterprise, deserves to be congratulated on that success. Liftshare is the UK&#8217;s premier car-sharing organisation and it works with the public and private sectors throughout the UK to set up online journey-matching tools and to help employers to market and monitor schemes.</p><p>Lift-share schemes can be private, closed schemes for single employers. In my constituency, organisations such as Aberdeen College, Robert Gordon University, the national health service, the councils, and employers such as Subsea 7 and Taqa Bratani all have schemes. They can also be open schemes at a regional or national level. They help people to find fellow travellers for regular journeys or even for one-off trips. They can even help people who do not have cars. Lift sharing does not need to be the choice for every trip, and people who car share do not need to live near each other. Councils are now encouraging people to use park-and-ride sites to meet up, giving free parking to those who choose to park and share.</p><p>I want to highlight an innovative regional scheme in the north-east of Scotland that is partnered with liftshare. The getabout initiative helps people to get from A to B in the Aberdeen city and shire region, which has high levels of commuting and significant congestion. Among other things, that congestion impacts on the effective running of public transport.</p><p>At the moment, about 80 per cent of commuter trips in the north-east are single occupant. Realising that that was not sustainable, north east of Scotland transport partnership and its partners set up getabout. The project was developed almost two years ago, and has eight partners across all the large organisations in Aberdeen city and shire. Its aim is to create a better transport network to promote greater choice and sustainable travel. It has developed a common brand under which everyone can run their own events or joint events, and it deals with a range of issues from travel plans to travel awareness activities. Its website is a virtual one-stop shop for information about travel choices, and getabout has taken quite a fun and fresh approach to encouraging people to get about more sustainably. Getabout has also carried out more than 110 events, from business days to road closures during European car-free day.</p><p>Recently, getabout has developed an online travel plan building and monitoring tool, which is offered free and allows businesses to write their own travel plans. Another piece of software called iTRACE has been installed to monitor travel plans and provide up-to-date figures on modal shift, carbon reduction and active travel. The information that it gathers will be invaluable in refining and promoting the ideas of the future. Although it is widely used in England, its use is a first for Scotland, and I hope that other regions will be able to follow that lead.</p><p>What do we need to do to encourage greater take-up of lift sharing? The Government needs to provide support and leadership, and councils and the private sector should work together to develop or enhance local schemes. We need to keep selling the idea and refreshing the message over the long term.</p><p>Concerns about safety and convenience can be easily addressed, and people should be reassured that the service is tried and tested. I would be interested to see a trial of high-occupancy vehicle lanes and the development of more park-and-share sites at strategic locations. Employers can help by earmarking premium parking places for car sharers and providing other incentives. I know of one company that has offered regular users of lift sharing an extra day&#8217;s leave per year.</p><p>Employers can help to build confidence in their scheme by providing a guaranteed ride home, so that if the driver falls ill, or in the event of an emergency, people can get home. Existing examples show that those guarantees are seldom used and rarely abused, but they can be used to help to persuade potential car sharers.</p><p>The transport sector is facing many challenges, but the need to reduce carbon and costs cannot be ignored. Looking forward, the Government has less money to invest in large-scale modal shift projects. These small-scale, softer options are cost effective and quick to implement, and they could play a significant role in bringing about the type of change that we want to see. I hope that others agree.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643331", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Car Sharing (North East Scotland)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I thank the members from all parties who signed my motion and those who have stayed late tonight to debate it.

It is a tried and tested scheme that is designed specifically to make the transportation of freight more sustainable and we know that it has worked, bringing a reduction of 33.5 million heavy goods vehicle road miles per annum across Scotland.</p><p>In my own region, awards that were granted to Asda, W H Malcolm, ARR Craib Transport and DRS have resulted in the removal of around 12,000 lorry journeys from the A9 and A90 each year. Such grants are estimated to have provided roughly &#163;4 million-worth of environmental benefits over the past five years.</p><p>Despite those positive results in the north east and throughout Scotland, there is much work still <place-holder colnum=\"32283\"/> to be done, given that more than 1.5 billion HGV miles were travelled on the road network last year.</p><p>By withdrawing support for the FFG at this point, ministers are taking a puzzling approach that goes against the grain of the stated aims of transport and climate change policies. The national transport strategy states that the Government will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Actively promote sustainable distribution strategies, aimed at enabling freight to use rail and sea as alternatives to road and reducing the environmental impact of freight ... on roads\".</p><p>Despite the Scottish National Party's claim to be striving for a Scotland that is characterised by the sustainable movement of freight, it seems to be intent on jettisoning an initiative that is aligned with its policy objectives and is proven to work.</p><p>The TICC Committee raised concerns about the scheme's closure in its budget submission to the Finance Committee, but the concern is wider than that. Members will all have heard the concerns of Direct Rail Services, the Rail Freight Group, ASLEF and the RMT. Transform Scotland has warned that the loss of the grant may even lead to some of the freight that is sustainably transported at present reverting back to road haulage. That is a worrying prospect indeed, and I hope that the minister will address it later in the debate.</p><p>Even if that fear proves to be unfounded, the suspension of the scheme at the very least immediately puts at risk five large-scale modal shift projects throughout Scotland. In my own region, that means that a project by Lafarge to take hundreds of lorry-loads of bagged cement off the road may now not go ahead.</p><p>The minister should know that I will find it difficult indeed to explain to my constituents why a Government that is supposedly committed to moving freight from road to rail is, in this case, acting to prevent that from happening.</p><p>I have so far focused on the benefits that the FFG provides in terms of sustainability and emissions levels, but we should not overlook the other benefits of taking freight off the road. In road safety terms, for example, HGVs are involved in accidents that represent a cost of &#163;1.3 billion a year throughout the UK. By reducing the number of HGVs, we can reduce the frequency and severity of such accidents.</p><p>I am told that the cancellation of the grant will result in an additional cost of &#163;2.4 million per annum in road maintenance. We know that councils are already facing crippling road maintenance bills because of the harsh winter&#8212;surely we should be doing all that we can to reduce the number of HGVs that are pounding the roads.<place-holder colnum=\"32284\"/></p><p>I appreciate that we are facing unprecedented economic times, and that consequently Governments must look again at their actions. Nevertheless, the cancellation of the grant without any indication of how the positive outcomes from the scheme will be achieved in other ways can be described only as short-sighted.</p><p>It would be helpful if the minister, in his speech at the end of the debate, could inform us of how his Government intends to fill the gap that the cancellation of the grant will leave and ensure that Scotland is travelling forwards, not backwards, with regard to sustainable freight management.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21178263", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freight Facilities Grants"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Cathy Jamieson on securing this debate, which provides us with an opportunity to discuss not only the future of the freight facilities grant but also the wider issue of sustainable freight transport in Scotland.

As others have said, the timing of the report, which was a knock-on effect of the Government's disappointing attitude when it originally set the targets last year, was unfortunate at best. I hope that the Government takes note of the committee's comments on how the process might be better handled in the future.</p><p>The minister has joined us at what we could call stage 3 of the Parliament's climate change process. Stage 1 was the passing of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, which laid out the important framework for us to work within. Stage 2 <place-holder colnum=\"32053\"/> was our agreeing the first batch of annual targets, thereby plotting the path that we need to take to fulfil our new long-term emissions obligations. Now, we have come to probably the most important part of the process&#8212;setting out how we intend to make the changes to our homes, businesses and lifestyles that will be necessary if we are to succeed in taking that path and achieving our climate change targets.</p><p>As a starting point for that, the draft report on proposals and policies is to be welcomed. Indeed, I commend the Government for the comprehensive coverage that it has given to the measures in the draft RPP. There are a number of proposals that I am particularly pleased to see included. For example, the extension of eco-driving training and promotion is an ideal measure for us to take, as it not only helps to reduce emissions but can lead to people saving money.</p><p>That particular example, however, leads me to the first of a few problems with the RPP as it stands. Although many proposals are included, a large proportion of them foresee action being taken on a voluntary basis. I agree absolutely that voluntary measures that require personal behaviour change must play a part in the move to a low-carbon Scotland, but I am not convinced that we can be sure that they will be enough in every situation. I suggest that the Government needs to consider carefully how it intends to monitor whether those voluntary measures will make the progress that is needed if the proposals are to be successful in reaching their maximum forecast emissions abatement potential.</p><p>That, in turn, brings me to another concern with the draft RPP. As things stand, meeting our 2020 target would require every existing policy to reach its maximum abatement potential and relies on the EU making the move to a 30 per cent target. It is also dependent on action in a number of policy areas being taken by, and future funding from, the UK Government. Of course, we all hope for the best-case scenario, but it is essential to make allowances for things being otherwise. I emphasise to the minister the importance of continuing to develop new proposals and of not assuming that every measure in the RPP will succeed. I also underline the committee's call on the Government to outline its intended plans if the EU does not move to a 30 per cent target.</p><p>In addition, it is vital that the Government properly reconciles its budget with the RPP. Our committee report underlines concerns that have already been highlighted with regard to whether the 2011-12 budget contains adequate provision for measures on active travel and modal shift within the freight industry, for example. Publishing policies and proposals is worthless unless they are properly budgeted for, so I strongly associate <place-holder colnum=\"32054\"/> myself with the committee's calls for budget decisions and the monitoring of the progress of the RPP to be closely linked and mutually informed.</p><p>In the brief time that I have left, I would like to touch on a few of the issues from the draft RPP in various sectors.</p><p>On energy measures, I echo the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's conclusions on the overreliance on UK policies and funding. Working jointly on measures at a UK level is necessary&#8212;and desirable, to some extent&#8212;but the Government must ensure that Scotland is able to meet its energy efficiency goals from within its own resources if necessary.</p><p>In terms of the public sector's role, the committee heard from several people on the need for greater clarity from central Government about what is expected from councils. Concerns were also raised about the level of resources, capacity and skills that are available to local government in order for those expectations to be met. There are many areas&#8212;the transport sector being a good example&#8212;where the most effective action to reduce emissions can be taken at a local level. It is crucial, therefore, that the Government sets out clearly what role it expects local authorities to play and that it provides the proper support to allow them to deliver.</p><p>Finally, on transport, I have already mentioned the apparent disconnect between the transport proposals and the draft budget, but I would also like to highlight the point that was raised by many who gave evidence to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee on the sustainable transport hierarchy. I strongly agree that the first consideration in reducing emissions from transport is, and ought to be, reducing the need to travel in the first place. I ask the Government to think again about how it can underline the importance of reducing the need to travel as the vital first step. Without that emphasis, the current proposals on transport in the draft RPP fall well short of achieving the step change in policy direction that is needed to meet our climate change targets.</p><p>As I said earlier, the draft RPP is to be welcomed, but as a starting point for our journey to a low-carbon Scotland, not as a finished route map. It contains good proposals, but equally more options must be considered. I trust that the minister will take full account of the points that have been raised today, the committee reports and the views of the many who have responded to us, and I look forward to her returning to Parliament with a suitably revised report.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1: \"Report on Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome Roseanna Cunningham to the climate change brief.

It is a pleasure to support the motion in her name.</p><p>The WRVS is a great organisation. From its roots in long-established services such as meals on wheels, hospital trolleys and lunch clubs it has branched out into innovative schemes such as good neighbour and community transport schemes. It has listened and responded to the changing needs of elderly people. The WRVS <place-holder colnum=\"31341\"/> slogan&#8212;positive about age, practical about life&#8212;sums up its approach well.</p><p>As we heard, the WRVS has an army of volunteers, who are worth their weight in gold. Many of them are retired&#8212;it is about time that we redefined the word \"elderly\". In my region, many people offer their time to the organisation, to help thousands of elderly people remain in their own homes for longer than they would otherwise be able to do. The volunteers are held in high regard locally. Many have continued to help during the current tough weather conditions, and I commend them for that.</p><p>In north Aberdeenshire, the good neighbour and community transport scheme covers the villages of Ellon, Newburgh and Balmedie. Volunteers who give just two or three hours a week make an immense difference to people's lives every week. The scheme provides a great service by keeping elderly people in touch, helping them to attend day centres, keep medical appointments, and go on social outings or do shopping. It also reduces isolation by helping people to visit relatives in hospital or care homes. Just as important is the companionship and friendship that are offered to the housebound. These days, families are often scattered and too far away to help with the little things, and WRVS good neighbours provide company and help with a range of tasks such as collecting pensions, going on outings, and even attending when workmen or officials visit so that people do not feel scared.</p><p>As council and health care budgets are squeezed, funding tends to be ever more focused on those at high risk, and investment in preventive care is neglected. That is a false economy, which leaves us with growing bills. As Karen Gillon said, it is estimated that 1.3 million Scots will be at or above the pension age by 2031 and if we keep providing social care in the same old way, we could be spending another &#163;27 billion over the next 15 years. I have also heard it estimated that if we keep trying to provide care in the same way, by 2030 every school leaver will have to go and work in the health service. We will spend all those billions of pounds, but there will be no discernable improvement in people's circumstances. We will just be dealing with those growing numbers.</p><p>If we tackle the situation from the other end and intervene early to help people to stay in their own homes and to remain as active as possible in their community, that is more cost effective and beneficial to people's overall wellbeing. We should surely be striving to do that. More than 60 per cent of the Scottish Government's spending on care for older people is on care in hospitals and care homes. Almost &#163;1.4 billion a year is spent on emergency and unelected admissions, while only 6 per cent is spent on providing care at home. As <place-holder colnum=\"31342\"/> Johann Lamont said, we must find a way to shift the focus from institutionalised care towards more independent living. WRVS and Age Scotland can help us to do that.</p><p>The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts's recent publication \"Radical Scotland\" demonstrates one way of doing that. It points to the introduction in Western Australia of local area co-ordinators who match the personal needs of the service users in a particular area to what local providers, existing social networks and community assets can offer.

Despite being a member of the administrative staff, I was encouraged to attend lectures by the scientists, and it was there, not at school, where I discovered the fascinating worlds of astronomy and physics.</p><p>I did study science at school, but I was cursed to have a physics teacher who refused to answer any questions from the two girls in his higher class. He thought that girls were not suited to studying physics. On reflection, I do not think that he was suited to teaching.</p><p>My daughter assures me that it is all different nowadays and that she owes a lot to the physics department at Ellon academy, which supported and encouraged her interest in physics. I am glad to hear it.</p><p>Events such as science and the Parliament provide useful reminders to politicians that scientific understanding and innovation are central to our country's progress. If we are to develop technical, sustainable solutions for tomorrow's world, we must not lose sight of that message in these difficult times. We must sustain and develop our science base. Our role as politicians is surely to demonstrate that we understand that need, to show that we value our scientists and to do all that we can to support investment in science. We need sustained investment in our people, in our universities and in our research establishments, and we need to foster collaboration with the private sector.</p><p>There are so many areas in which science plays a role in society, including energy, food, climate change, human health, the management of finite resources and even the infrastructure of our cities. As the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on climate change, I am acutely aware that if we are to tackle the world's most pressing problem, we will need to rely on the brightest scientific minds.</p><p>As an MSP for North East Scotland, I am privileged to represent a region that contributes so much to scientific knowledge. The world's first medical school was established in Aberdeen in the 15th century, at King's College, and the four universities in Aberdeen and Dundee, alongside institutes such as the SAC, the Macaulay Institute, the Scottish Crop Research Institute and the Rowett institute, have all continued that tradition of scientific excellence.</p><p>In Dundee, scientists from more than 52 countries are employed in biotechnology and more than 4,000 people work in the sector&#8212;that is 16 per cent of the local economy. If we add the pharmaceuticals industry in Montrose and the oil and gas industry in Aberdeen&#8212;city and shire&#8212;we <place-holder colnum=\"30282\"/> can see that many of my constituents are employed in science, engineering and technology.</p><p>All is not well in the scientific community, as we have heard. I will use the little time that I have to focus on the gender imbalance that still exists. As women who have chosen to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduate and progress in their careers, they are far more likely to leave the science and technology sectors than are men. Their leaving represents a loss of return on the investment in their education, a loss of talent for the sector and a loss of individuals' personal investment in their science and technology education. The effect is to create a gender-segregated workforce, which does not represent the general population or draw in diverse talents and is not attractive and welcoming to women.</p><p>Many factors contribute to the underrepresentation of women in SET. We have heard about such factors during the debate. I commend the work of the Scottish resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology. The Institute of Physics also has a good record in the area.</p><p>I lay down a challenge to Universities Scotland, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Each of those institutions can make a real difference, but if they work together they can bring about a sea change and ensure that young women scientists have a fair chance to play their part in the scientific advances of the future.

Liberal Democrats believe that business should be treated fairly and that the transitional scheme on which everyone relied should be reinstated. It was not fair to take it away, and it is not too late to do something about that.</p><p>No one is quibbling about the rates revaluation&#8212;everyone knows that that comes around every five years. However, businesses are rightly angry about the fact that a safety net has been whipped away without so much as a by-your-leave. The SNP's handling of the revaluation has been botched. Instead of phasing in big rate hikes in the co-operative and consensual manner of the past, it has set companies against one another, favouring some and cold-shouldering the rest. As Wendy Alexander noted, companies were given just six weeks' notice of the increases.</p><p>The principles of transitional relief are well established and well understood; businesses in England are benefiting from it as we speak. Previous Governments have protected companies from big rises in a year. This time there has been no protection, and many companies are struggling to cope with really crippling increases.</p><p>Obviously, there are winners and losers in any revaluation. However, in the past there has been a transition to soften the blow; businesses did not suffer the full force of rate rises in one go. This time it is different, because we have an SNP Government. Businesses across Scotland find themselves left alone to deal with huge increases in their tax bills at the very time when, having managed to weather the recession so far, they might have expected to be able to look for support from their Government. Tens of thousands of businesses are worse off as a result of the revaluation. Some have faced a 200 per cent increase in their bills. As Jeremy Purvis pointed out, 80 per cent of them have appealed.</p><p>A number of firms in the retail, hospitality, energy, mining, whisky and agricultural sectors have told the Confederation of British Industry of their deep disquiet about the Scottish Government's decision not to place a cap on and not to phase in the bumper increases in rates bills. Many of those firms are already struggling to emerge from the recession. Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce says that the increases are already costing jobs. We have already heard that rates in Aberdeen city and shire have gone up by &#163;30 million.<place-holder colnum=\"29713\"/></p><p>Sadly, across my region examples abound of massive hikes in rates. There are too many to mention them all, but I will give a few examples. Inverurie's Thainstone mart has seen its business rates soar by 71 per cent. Meldrum House hotel faces an increase of 161 per cent and Meldrum Motors faces one of 94 per cent. The hotel and hospitality sector has been particularly hard hit this time because its businesses were revalued by the Government based on their 2008 turnover, not profit. For many businesses, that was the peak year before the recession. As we have noted, to add insult to injury, many of the hotels that the Scottish Cabinet used on its summer tour of Scotland are among the worst hit.</p><p>It is not just the Liberal Democrats who are calling for the problem to be fixed. The Federation of Small Businesses, the British Hospitality Association Scotland, the CBI and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce have all criticised the lack of a transitional rates relief scheme. I know how valuable SMEs are, but that is not the whole picture. Bob Collier of the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"SME support is not a substitute for transitional relief for the hardest hit.\"</p><p>Government&#8212;and the Tories&#8212;insult business by continually refusing to recognise the real damage that has been caused by the sudden withdrawal of transitional relief and by the endless repetition of their refrain that it is okay because businesses should appeal if there are problems. As Mike Rumbles said, that is disingenuous. The appeals system is there for a different purpose. In addition, as John Swinney indicated today, it takes up to five years for appeals to be heard and resolved.</p><p>It is utterly complacent of the Government to argue that many businesses are better off and to turn a deaf ear to those who are worst affected. For a Government that likes to talk, it has been remarkably reluctant to have a conversation about this issue.</p><p>A number of members mentioned the extra &#163;150 million in tax take that the Government will draw down. I heard Mr Swinney's arguments, but several excuses are always less convincing than one. I agree more with Liz Cameron, who says that a transitional scheme needs to be introduced and can be afforded.</p><p>As Cathy Jamieson said, we have returned to the issue because it is still a problem. Liberal Democrats do not apologise for that. Unlike some members, we are willing to stand up for the whole business community. I say to Gavin Brown that we have repeatedly called on the Government to work with businesses to develop an affordable relief <place-holder colnum=\"29714\"/> scheme.

I am pleased that the minister took that advice, and I, too, thank everyone on the group. I think that we all worked well and constructively with the minister and his team throughout the summer, and we now have a set of annual targets that is improved to the tune of 14 million tonnes less CO2-equivalent emissions over the next 10 years, which is an amount that is broadly similar to that which would be achieved by taking all the cars in Scotland off the road for two years. That figure alone should serve as a vindication of our decision to vote no to the original statutory instrument.</p><p>Some claim that the annual percentage targets in the new Scottish statutory instrument are still disappointing. Taken out of context, perhaps they seem so. However, although annual reduction percentages are useful as indicators of progress, it is the cumulative emissions that tell the whole story. In that regard, the SSI is a real improvement.</p><p>It is important to remember that the revised short-term annual targets will be by no means easy to achieve, as Sarah Boyack pointed out. By altering the 2010 baseline target to take into account the decrease in emissions resulting from the economic downturn, we are making it slightly harder to make reductions in subsequent years. That is because, as well as finding cuts to make, we must take into account the need to manage the fact that emissions will start to increase as our economy recovers to pre-recession levels of activity.</p><p>Indeed, in many ways, the important part of our work on climate change has not yet started. With the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, we got our framework. With this SSI, we will get our targets. However, the real challenge will come in setting out the policies that will allow us to meet those targets. The Government must soon set out its proposals and policies for reducing emissions in Scotland. Getting to this stage has been a struggle, but I hope that the minister is under no illusions that, once he has passed the annual targets&#8212;with our support&#8212;our scrutiny of his climate change policies might let up.

We have magnificent wild land that is valued by many people&#8212;locals and tourists alike. However, it is under threat. SNH has reported that the extent of Scotland that is unaffected by any visual influence declined from 41 per cent to 31 per cent between 2002 and 2008. In the north-east, one threat is the <place-holder colnum=\"27132\"/> proliferation of bulldozed hill tracks. The bulldozing of tracks for agriculture, forestry and, in particular, sport has led to scars across the hills that are often visible over a wide area. They area also prone to erosion. I query whether the continuation of such unrestricted development is in the best interests of the environment. As the John Muir Trust has said, because hill tracks fall into the category of permitted development, no record is kept of their number, total distance, location, purpose, condition or rate of change. Surely that should not be sustained.</p><p>I do not suggest that hill tracks are not needed. They are, of course, important for essential land management and they allow ease of access for farmers. Farmers, crofters and foresters have a legitimate need to construct, maintain and develop tracks for their land management purposes. However, such tracks are usually on lower-lying ground, as Peter Peacock said. Concern is felt that loopholes in the current system are being exploited to the detriment of our special environment.</p><p>Tracks must be designed to fit into the landscape in which they are needed; they should not obliterate existing paths or historic trackways, and their design should minimise the need for engineering and road-related earthworks. Drawing hill tracks into a more affirmative planning approval system would assist with that. A scheme should be developed that takes a light-touch approach to the obvious necessities of agriculture, but which tightens rules that we think are being abused.</p><p>In some areas that have special designations, such as national scenic areas, special areas of conservation and SSSIs, the planning authority's prior approval should be sought. However, even now, the hill tracks campaign has identified several areas in which that does not seem to have been done appropriately. I share Peter Peacock's concern and bewilderment that national parks are not drawn into that system.</p><p>I do not doubt that a review of permitted development rights for hill tracks is overdue. I agree that the suggestion of developing a register of existing hill tracks has merit. I hope that cross-party agreement will be achieved tonight on the need to undertake that review and to have the discussion to protect our wild land for future generations.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20826453", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hill Tracks (Scottish Uplands)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I congratulate Peter Peacock on securing the debate.

As a result, I was pleased when we agreed to conduct an inquiry into active travel. Like others, I thank the clerks and fellow committee members for their work. Most of all, though, I thank those who gave evidence for providing us with a wealth of knowledge and for bringing such enthusiasm and optimism to the subject. Indeed, I think that all committee members have been infected by that enthusiasm&#8212;although Alex Johnstone was not present often enough to get infected by it. I am less sure that the minister has succumbed, but perhaps this afternoon we can persuade him that something really good can be done in Scotland.</p><p>I do not really need to rehearse the reasons why we should encourage active travel, although I could mention health and wellbeing benefits, sustainability, beating congestion, independence and financial savings&#8212;in fact, all those and more. Our inquiry focused on active travel not as a leisure pursuit but as a transport choice; in other words, instead of being an end in itself, it was about travelling with a purpose, be it to go to work, school or college, the local library, the shops, the brownies, the scouts or the sports pitch. Of course, any improvements will also benefit people who wish to walk and cycle just for the fun of it.</p><p>Where are we starting from? As Charlie Gordon pointed out, at the moment only 2 per cent of people cycle, only 1 per cent of children cycle to school and 12.5 per cent of people walk to work. The Sustainable Development Commission has said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Transport is the poorest performing area for sustainable development\"</p><p>and that within that poorly performing area</p><p class=\"indent\">\"active travel is in relative decline\".</p><p>That is not a very good starting point.</p><p>Our report focuses mainly on why Scotland is performing so poorly and, more important, on what can be done to improve matters. However, first of all, we had a quick reality check. Was there something distinct about Scotland that meant that we should not aspire to a more active travel style? What about the hills, the weather or the Scottish temperament? I reassure the chamber that we concluded that Scotland has the potential to embrace active travel.</p><p>What are the barriers? As Charlie Gordon pointed out, the widespread perception is that <place-holder colnum=\"27099\"/> cycling is unsafe. SPOKES, the Edinburgh cycle group, told us:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is a prerequisite for extensive cycle use for everyday journeys by a wide spectrum of the population that the road system looks, feels and is safe and welcoming for using a bike.\"</p><p>That can be achieved only through investment in infrastructure in order to deal with particular pinch points and difficult junctions, to provide dedicated cycle lanes where necessary and to reduce speed limits in residential areas. I certainly think that 20 mph should now be the norm in such areas. In the longer term, the planning process must pay heed to the needs of walkers and cyclists.</p><p>It is also worth noting that there is safety in numbers. The more cyclists and pedestrians who are out and about on our streets, the safer the streets become. Road safety must also be addressed through a more co-ordinated package of cycle training, and I welcome the comments that the minister made on that subject this afternoon.</p><p>With regard to increasing uptake in walking, Elaine Sheerin spoke with great zest about the Gorbals healthy living network and highlighted walking's social and safety aspects, while the Scottish Association for Mental Health pointed out that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there is a growing recognition that being physically active is strongly associated with mental wellbeing\".</p><p>I emphasise that point, because I think that it has been overlooked in the past. Having more people out and about on our streets has a positive impact on personal and community wellbeing, and we need to find some way of factoring the less-tangible benefits into our spending decisions.</p><p>Walking is human-scale activity. It is not only active but interactive: it allows us to relate to our communities in a way that is impossible if we simply drive everywhere. Walking is a sociable pursuit that gives us time to pay attention to our companions and to meet and greet neighbours. We notice more of what is going on around us and we feel better connected to our community. If the school walk replaces the school run, we will have the time to listen to our children's achievements of the day and to hear about their worries. Children, teenagers and the elderly all rely heavily on walking; surely they deserve to have a good environment in which to go about their business.</p><p>Our committee concluded that the two most significant barriers to improving our record are lack of leadership and inadequate budgets. Leadership is needed at local and national level. Recently, I attended a walking and cycling conference and encountered a room full of exceptional people who day in, day out champion active travel but who are often not supported enough by political commitment from either their councils or national <place-holder colnum=\"27100\"/> Government. Those people know what needs to be done and have the enthusiasm to make a difference. I want us to harness that enthusiasm for everyone's benefit. One of those people was Mark Kiehlmann of East Dunbartonshire's Cycle Co-op, who was recently given the Scottish and United Kingdom volunteer of the year 2009 award by the Cycling Touring Club. He is now organising the inaugural Bishopbriggs cycle festival, which will take place this Sunday. I wish him well with that.</p><p>However, enthusiasm alone will not bring about the changes that we want. We cannot escape the fact that a fairer share of funding is required. Sadly, since the Scottish National Party took over, total cycling investment has fallen each year. The minister's response is disappointing because it appears to be complacent. It is incredible that he thinks that his vision of a 10 per cent modal share for cycling by 2020 can be delivered with funding at the current level&#8212;he is kidding himself. The SNP is a serial offender in promising big but not always delivering. Surely the SNP has by now cottoned on to the fact that achievements do not happen by aspiration alone.</p><p>To improve take-up of active travel, we will need an investment programme that is sustained for many years. After the next spending review, I would like the funding that is available to the Government's sustainable transport team to increase steadily. A shift in priorities in the existing transport budget would mean that many people would opt to travel actively. The minister must match his ambition with the investment that is needed to bring about results.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20826408", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Active Travel"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "From the outset, the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee has taken an active interest in active travel and during the annual round of budget scrutiny we returned repeatedly to the need to allocate a greater share of the transport budget to active travel.

Early action sets the trend for years to come. That is why we want ambitious targets to be set from day one. We do not know what is going to happen two or three years down the line: we cannot possibly know whether we will be in the position to make a 9 per cent reduction in carbon emissions in a single year. That is why we need to cut emissions early, and to cut them consistently.</p><p>We stand by that position. The statutory instrument that is before us today does not demand early action and we cannot support it. The minister repeats that the Government is following the UK CCC's advice, and is bettering it, even. He believes that we can do better in 2011 and 2012 than the UK CCC suggests&#8212;not much better, but a little better. If we can do better in those two years, why are there no knock-on improvements over the trajectory that is set out for the years to follow? If the UK CCC has missed some policy measures in its advice, as the Government is suggesting, how can we know that it has not missed others?</p><p>The minister tells us that nothing more can be done, and that no extra cuts can be made, and he asks that we put into law binding annual targets solely on the basis of his word. We cannot do that. The minister should have engaged with Opposition parties on the targets long before we got to this stage. He should have consulted us on the targets and made available the figures that were produced by his Government for us to study, as well as suggesting areas for improvement. He should have realised that the best way to get the targets right&#8212;targets that will truly place Scotland as a <place-holder colnum=\"26721\"/> world-leader in the fight against climate change&#8212;is through co-operation, discussion and openness.</p><p>The minister should have set up an open-book working group at an early stage, for all parties along with Government officials and experts, to examine the figures, to examine potential policy moves and initiatives and to work together to determine the best possible emissions reductions trajectory for Scotland. He should have done that months ago. The Liberal Democrats would have been delighted to play a full and active role in such an important matter. He should still do it now. The Liberal Democrats will be delighted to play a full and active role in such an important matter. Such a working group, with cross-party involvement and access to all the figures, could take the time that is needed to gather all the facts and then return to Parliament with a set of annual targets that everyone in Parliament could be confident in, and that we could all agree are the best possible targets that Scotland should be aiming for.</p><p>I strongly suggest to the minister that he seek to withdraw the order that is in front of us today, that he allow such an open-book group to be set up and that he report back to Parliament on its findings.</p><p>By not setting the annual targets today, we will miss the first deadline under the 2009 act, which is regrettable. Let me make one thing clear, however: we will have missed it not because of petty politicking, as the First Minister implied earlier today, but because the climate change minister failed to engage properly, failed to consult properly and failed to treat the task with the respect that it deserves. The minister must take responsibility for that.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats believe that it would be a disappointment for the first deadline for setting annual targets to be missed, but it would be a travesty if we were to agree to annual targets that we do not think represent the best possible targets for Scotland to aim for. We want to work in a cross-party, constructive atmosphere to get the necessary agreements. We believe that the minister should withdraw the SSI that is before us today.

However, we still have serious reservations about the funding mechanism. Paying for the replacement crossing directly through the capital budget at a time when we all know that money is at a premium risks sidelining and displacing other important capital projects. Many questions remain, and we will listen closely to what the Government has to say as the bill progresses.</p><p>As has been said, the bill is complex. Of course, that is hardly surprising, given that it sets out the single largest project that this Parliament will deal with. I therefore hope that members will understand when I say that I cannot hope to cover <place-holder colnum=\"26563\"/> every aspect of the bill in my six minutes. My colleagues Margaret Smith and Jim Tolson will focus on a number of details that are of particular concern to local residents around the crossing's proposed site, while I will spend my time on the issue of public transport.</p><p>Many of us were greatly disappointed when the Government decided to turn its back on earlier ambitions to make the new crossing fully multimodal, providing for cyclists, pedestrians, buses and, potentially, light rapid transport alongside cars. I appreciate that the Government was looking to reduce the project's projected costs, but a number of concerns remain over the long-term viability of using the existing Forth bridge as the only public transport route. As that ship seems to have sailed, it is even more important that detailed plans of the Government's multimodal intentions are produced alongside if not within the bill.</p><p>Members of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee heard predictions that, although the new bridge will not necessarily increase capacity, it will precipitate a negative modal shift, with people moving away from public transport and into their cars. Clearly, that would not be compatible with reducing greenhouse gas emissions and would hardly help in easing congestion. The need to mitigate the expected modal shift away from public transport has been acknowledged, but I am concerned by the suggestion that it will be addressed only after the main project has been completed. Important as it is to deliver the bridge itself, I do not think it unreasonable to suggest that it is equally important to work to ensure that the use of public transport is not only provided for but actively promoted and encouraged.</p><p>The key here is co-ordination. Given that a potential negative impact of the new bridge&#8212;the shift away from public transport&#8212;has been identified, it seems strange that we will have to wait until it happens before we set about rectifying it. Equally, although the new bridge is the cause of the expected negative modal shift, the solution needs to be sought on a much wider scale. We should think not just about providing bus capacity on the existing bridge but about, for example, integrating bus and rail services across the whole Forth transport corridor to ensure that public transport not only remains a viable option but becomes a better one. That work needs to be carried out by the minister and Transport Scotland not by themselves but, as the minister himself has said, in conjunction with regional transport partnerships, local councils and other transport groups. Given the complex, detailed and wide-ranging nature of the work that needs to be carried out, it would make much more sense to begin it alongside the work on the bridge so that, by the <place-holder colnum=\"26564\"/> time the bridge is completed, we will see no negative impact at all. Surely that should be the goal.</p><p>There has been a good amount of discussion over whether public transport plans ought to be included in the bill or developed alongside or in addition to it. There are reasoned arguments on both sides; those who seek inclusion have pointed out that it is the easiest way of ensuring the proper provision of public transport options, while those who argue against have reasoned that the bill's primary concern is and should be infrastructure provision. I can certainly see the pitfalls of bogging the bill down in arguments about the details of individual transport initiatives and schemes, but I am not against a more explicit laying-out of some more detailed plans. At the very least, I want the Government to accept the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's recommendation that the bill include a requirement for Scottish ministers to produce an enhanced public transport strategy and action plan.</p><p>With regard to active travel options, I highlight the concerns raised in the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's report about the lack of provision on the new crossing for pedestrians and cyclists. I am disappointed to note that as yet we have seen no detail of any plans to improve cycling and walking routes and access in the existing bridge's immediate surrounding areas. I expect that to be rectified in a comprehensive public transport strategy from the Government.</p><p>Similarly, I believe that we should address sooner rather than later the issue of contingency plans in the event that the existing bridge is closed for any period of time. Although public transport might well be rerouted on to the hard shoulders of the new crossing for short periods&#8212;itself hardly an ideal solution&#8212;I do not think that we can expect pedestrians simply to take their chances dodging the traffic.

While Wendy Alexander's analysis was a welcome contribution to the debate, the SNP's contribution has been dire. Its only solution to the problem is to tell people to appeal. It is wrong for a minister to suggest that appealing is a solution without explaining the grounds of such an appeal.</p><p>During the Easter recess, I visited some local businesses that are hit hard by rates revaluation&#8212;businesses such as Deans of Huntly and Aberdeen and Northern Marts, which are based locally but are of local and national standing. I have surveyed hotels in my region and have been in contact with the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce. I have found out about some massive hikes in rates.</p><p>I have also learned of owners' and managers' fears for their businesses in light of the increases. The Liberal Democrats have used their time in the chamber this morning to give those businesses a <place-holder colnum=\"25326\"/> voice in Parliament. Obviously, any revaluation has winners and losers, but in the past there has been a transitional relief scheme to soften the blow&#8212;businesses did not suffer the full force of the rate rise in one go. It is different this time around because the SNP Government has refused to put a transitional relief scheme in place. Businesses throughout Scotland find themselves left alone to deal with huge increases in their bills just when, having perhaps managed to weather the recession so far, they might expect to look for support from the Government.</p><p>Gus Stewart, a rating partner at Ryden, summed up the mood:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is strange that at a time when transitional relief would probably have been at its most helpful for those seeing significant increases and ratepayers already struggling in the face of a recession, that it has been removed. The Government has publicised the fact that the reduction in the uniform business rate (UBR) will itself cushion the increases, but this is the same uniform business rate as applied in England and it will have a transitional relief scheme. Scottish businesses are once again the poor relations.\"</p><p>As we have already heard this morning, auction marts across Scotland are facing astronomical business rate increases and Inverurie's Thainstone mart is the hardest hit of them all. Aberdeen and Northern Marts has seen its business rates soar 70.7 per cent to &#163;248,400.</p><p>The president of the IAAS, John Gregor, has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Government professes to be a strong supporter of the livestock industry in Scotland. However, by not re-introducing transitional relief, they are letting the industry down and threatening its very existence.\"</p><p>He went on to say that we cannot allow the livestock industry to suffocate under such charges.</p><p>Hotels have been badly hit too. Ivor Finnie, director of EDC hotels in the north-east explained to me that his rates will rise by 45.87 per cent, which represents an increase of &#163;280,000. He said that that was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"an astronomical sum for our business and in the absence of transitional relief in my opinion, a wholly unfair increase.\"</p><p>Further, Malmaison in Aberdeen, a welcome newcomer to the hotel scene, has been sent a bill for a 66 per cent increase. Agriculture and tourism are vital to Scotland's economy, yet the Government has refused so far to lend a hand.</p><p>Jim Tolson mentioned the Lauriston nursery in Dunfermline that saw its rates rise by 150 per cent and finds itself paying more than Dunfermline Football Club. Mr Salmond was happy to have his photograph taken at the nursery last month; I wonder whether he will now be happy to vote for the introduction of a transitional relief scheme to ease the burden on Ms Crush's business.<place-holder colnum=\"25327\"/></p><p>Alex Salmond is always quick to pronounce on economic issues that are the preserve of Westminster, but there has been an uncomfortable silence from him on business rates in Scotland, which are entirely within his power to do something about. In the First Minister's constituency, Meldrum House Hotel faces an increase of 161 per cent; Thainstone mart 71 per cent; Meldrum Motors 94 per cent; Strathburn Hotel 56 per cent; and Dean's of Huntly 23 per cent. Those massive rises are unfair, yet the First Minister has nothing to say on the topic. The SNP's latest public relations campaign tries to kid us that electing SNP politicians is akin to electing local champions. The businesses of Gordon do not have a local champion in their local MSP in this matter. Alex Salmond has not been heard articulating the concerns of local businesses in Inverurie, Meldrum or Huntly.</p><p>The refrain from the Government that 60 per cent of businesses will be better off is no consolation to the 40 per cent of them who are hardest hit. Jeremy Purvis, our finance spokesperson, warned the Government last year about the difficulties that this revaluation would cause and the Lib Dems have been calling for action for months. The SNP has blithely ignored those calls and turned its back on some of our most important businesses. It is not just me who thinks that; CBI Scotland director, Iain McMillan, recently said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We're not happy that (finance secretary) John Swinney has rejected the business community's advice. We're living in times of severe economic restrictions\".</p><p>Before the revaluation in 2005, the previous Scottish Government consulted widely and introduced a transitional relief scheme to limit the increases in business rates. In 2010, the UK Government is doing that for English businesses, yet at a time of deep recession the SNP does not think that there is any need for a transitional relief scheme. I say that it is unfair to put Scottish businesses at a competitive disadvantage compared with businesses in England. It is time for the SNP Government to think again. It is not too late to introduce a transitional relief scheme to limit the increase in bills. In the end it comes down to fairness.</p><p>The Conservatives and the SNP voted down our first attempt to introduce a transitional relief scheme; today we give them another chance.

A modern, accessible, well-designed, flexible fleet&#8212;I am not referring to bendy buses&#8212;means that buses could become the transport of choice for many more people. It also means that, as Charlie Gordon said, buses could provide a variety of different services. Local authorities are already finding that greater efficiencies are to be won through the integration of school bus services, supported services and social-work vehicles. Sophisticated <place-holder colnum=\"24725\"/> information technology systems have allowed that progress, when for many years it was only imagined.

As a model 3 regional transport partnership, SPT is funded differently from the other RTPs, and is therefore almost uniquely placed to be able to afford to purchase, maintain and store buses. Although there is room for a great deal of improvement in some of the buses running on the streets of our cities, we should not lose sight of the fact that major bus companies in Scotland have spent more than &#163;500 million on new low-floor, greener vehicles over the past 10 years. Mr Gordon says that I am calling for something that is already in place. That is not the case. The green bus fund is flawed.

Labour has a golden opportunity next week to take up our suggestion and give tangible support to the bus manufacturing industry. We have suggested that we would invest &#163;60 million in a bus scrappage scheme that helps bus companies to replace old polluting buses with new low-carbon ones and creates jobs.</p><p>As much as 20,000 tonnes of CO2 would be saved as a result of such a scheme. Diesel emissions, particularly from older vehicles, are, of course, the biggest problem in our large towns and cities, and poor air quality has serious implications for public health; indeed, it causes tens of thousands of premature deaths in the UK each year. Our proposal would have a significant impact on reducing air pollution and carbon emissions. It <place-holder colnum=\"24726\"/> would also create an economic stimulus.

Making early cuts in carbon emissions will be extremely important in easing the path towards that target.</p><p>I was delighted that the minister reaffirmed the Government's commitment to reaching the 42 per cent target during the launch of the CCC's advice. We are under no illusion that meeting that target will be easy, but by staying the course, Scotland is setting an example for the rest of the world to follow, and I am truly hopeful that we can put pressure on the EU to shake off the disappointments of Copenhagen and toughen its commitments. Let us remember that as well as being key to making a real difference in tackling climate change, stronger international targets will help us to meet our national targets.</p><p>I am interested in Sarah Boyack's decision to focus on the Government's car fleet. Although I recognise that heed must be paid to the cost to the taxpayer, I fully agree that the Government should be looking to shift to low or zero-emission vehicles. In the Scottish National Party's first two years in power, the Government car service bought 18 new cars&#8212;14 diesels and four hybrids. I acknowledge what the minister said about emissions, and we cannot pretend that reversing that trend will have a huge impact on Scottish emissions&#8212;unless I am significantly underestimating the extent to which Mr Stevenson and his colleagues are driven around&#8212;but it will set an example. If we are to see the step change in reducing emissions from transport, as well as from buildings, waste and electricity, the need for which the CCC's report highlighted, the Government must take the lead.</p><p>I am sure that the minister will recognise the language of my amendment from last summer's climate change delivery plan, in which the planning and development of a battery-charging infrastructure is identified as a must-do for the \"transformational change\" of a wholesale switch to electric vehicles in the 2020s. Of course, such a <place-holder colnum=\"24700\"/> switch cannot happen overnight, but if it is to happen at all, people will need to be sure that the right infrastructure is in place&#8212;or, at the very least, that it is properly planned for. Until a comprehensive charging network is planned for, electric cars can never be much more than gadgets&#8212;cars for short journeys&#8212;with petrol-fuelled cars remaining kings of the A roads. Once plans are in place for a charging infrastructure and there is evidence that the Government and the country are serious about making that change, even if it will not be completed for some years, people can at least start to give electric cars genuine consideration. Nissan's announcement today is very welcome. The private sector is stepping up and the Government needs to match that action.</p><p>The UK Government launched its plugged-in places infrastructure framework in November by offering funding to create charging infrastructure in lead cities across the UK. London, North East England and Milton Keynes were successful in the first round, and several other cities and regions were marked as having made strong bids. Disappointingly, no Scottish city or region was mentioned. Given that the second deadline for submissions is in June, I strongly urge the Government to work with local authorities, businesses and other organisations to share its expertise and seriously explore whether a suitable submission could still be made. I am sure that the minister would agree that it would be a crying shame if Scotland were to miss out not only on the chance to support the early market for electric vehicles, but on helping to shape the future of Britain's transport infrastructure. From this point on, it will be a crying shame if Scotland misses out on any such opportunity.</p><p>The Committee on Climate Change made it clear that a step change is needed right across the country.

The gap between the best-funded council and the poorest-funded one is far too great, given that they all have statutory services to deliver. Setting aside the special case of island councils, the range goes from 123 per cent down to 84 per cent.

It is therefore essential that meaningful training and work be provided for people who have disabilities or health conditions. Ideally people should where possible be supported, through training and the gaining of practical work experience, to move into mainstream employment. That said, there will always be a role for supported workshops.</p><p>Alongside the more traditional large workshops, such as Remploy in Aberdeen and Dundee and Glencraft in my area, the north-east has a strong social enterprise sector. Many social enterprises provide meaningful work for people with disabilities. Off the top of my head, I can think of the following enterprises that are close to my constituency office: Benchmark in Ellon; Can-Do Community Recycling in Fraserburgh; Wood Recyclability in Pitmedden; Rosie's Cafe in Aberdeen; and&#8212;right next door to me in Inverurie&#8212;Fly Cup Catering, where I can pop in for a cuppa and a fine piece.</p><p>There are also many new and exciting initiatives such as the Bread Maker in Aberdeen, which Nanette Milne mentioned. The Bread Maker&#8212;this year's winner of the social enterprise Scotland award&#8212;is an artisan bakery and coffee house that provides meaningful work and training for adults with learning disabilities. It provides work for 27 apprentices who achieve shared goals in creating and selling a range of innovative top-quality hand-crafted bread, rolls and confectionery in a high-quality environment and providing them for sale in a warm and welcoming environment with the highest standards of customer service.</p><p>There are many more such examples in the north-east and across Scotland, all of which operate differently but all of which have the same aim: to provide a safe and supportive work environment for people who would otherwise struggle in the job market. That additional support is costly to provide for all those businesses, which makes them immediately less profitable. For some, the added difficulties of trading during a recession can be the last straw. We need to look at ways of supporting these valuable enterprises. I <place-holder colnum=\"23346\"/> am absolutely certain that the support that they provide is invaluable to our society. During the current recession, when job opportunities are scarce, it is particularly important to protect and develop those work opportunities.</p><p>I add my voice to the calls on the public sector to make greater use of article 19. If even a tiny percentage of public sector contracts were to be earmarked in that way, the result would be such a boost to the sustainability of social enterprises. The public sector could make its money work twice as hard. Surely that is something that we all want to happen. Both Remploy and the British Association for Supported Employment believe that that would deliver a clear community benefit.</p><p>As Social Enterprise Scotland outlined in its briefing,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"just as consumers are increasingly aware that they can achieve more for their money by investing ethically or purchasing fair trade products, so public bodies must engage in strategic procurement to add value to the communities they serve.\"</p><p>As John Lamont said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"By examining 'value for people' rather than just value for money, they can achieve added value through purchasing decisions.

I imagined that after countless committee appearances and numerous debates on the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill during the first half of the year, he might have become rather fed up at the sight of me and my committee colleagues, but he is back for more. I reassure him that although we may have had our differences over certain aspects of the bill, we are singing from the same sheet today, and I am pleased at the outward-looking nature of the Government's motion.</p><p>In the months that we spent working on our bill, we naturally focused on a great many details, but it is very much the bigger picture that has been in focus this week as the COP15 got under way in Copenhagen. I do not think that there will be a single dissenting voice in the chamber when I say that we look to the participants in the talks to bring forward the most ambitious commitments and reach a legally binding agreement at the earliest opportunity that will prevent world temperatures from rising by more than 2&#176;C.</p><p>The threat that we face from human-caused climate change is very real and very serious. I do not quite agree with the newspaper headlines that proclaim that COP15 represents our two weeks to save the world, but it is perhaps fair to say that we have two weeks in which we must at least start to save the world.</p><p>The fact is that, here in Scotland, we can cut our carbon emissions by 42 per cent, by 80 per cent or by 100 per cent, or we can turn everything off completely, but it will not make a difference unless <place-holder colnum=\"22135\"/> the rest of the world is with us. It is therefore gratifying that in the past few weeks so many nations have announced their own commitments to cut emissions. Some of those are welcome commitments, but some need to go much further. We need countries that are willing to take the lead and set an example for others to follow.</p><p>Although Scotland is, disappointingly, not officially represented in the negotiations, we have already set our example with the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. I believe that the targets that we have enshrined in law are the minimum for which any developed nation should aim. Indeed, I hope that we can achieve even greater reductions. The motion rightly alludes to the fact that nations find themselves in different circumstances so it is likely that a range of targets and commitments will be needed to find the best overall deal. That is okay. It is only right. However, everybody needs to remember that, on the whole, it is the world's richest countries that contribute the most to global warming and the world's poorest countries that will suffer the most devastating consequences.</p><p>I certainly do not envy the negotiators in Copenhagen. It will not be easy to find the right combination and the right compromises. This week, some of the many differences between parties have been exposed already. The leak of the draft text that was prepared by the Danish hosts was certainly not ideal, but it at least served to highlight some of the things that need to be addressed and, I hope, to underline how vital it is that the UN and its representatives are not sidelined in the negotiations. There is too much at stake to risk the talks becoming fractured over leaked and unofficial documents.</p><p>Bringing together the developed world, the rapidly industrialising world and the developing world is not going to be easy. We cannot allow industrialisation to continue without restrictions on carbon emissions, yet it seems unfair to impose on expanding economies handicaps that we never had to face. I firmly believe that just as important as the limiting of carbon emissions is that industrialised nations put in place proper support and incentives to encourage developing nations to turn to sustainable technologies as an integral part of their growth. Similarly, the Liberal Democrats have long argued that it is only right for the poorest nations to be given financial support to help them adapt to the effects of climate change. I certainly hope that that will be properly addressed in Copenhagen.</p><p>Ultimately, of course, the parties at Copenhagen can put forward the most ambitious targets imaginable, but until they are acted on, they will be just that&#8212;targets. Getting an agreement will be a challenge, but the hardest work lies not during next eight days but during the next 40 years. <place-holder colnum=\"22136\"/></p><p>Governments can and must do a lot, but making a difference will still rely greatly on the public's attitude.</p><p>On Saturday, I had the pleasure of joining 7,000 or so other people to march&#8212;sorry, that should be to flow&#8212;through the streets of Glasgow as part of the wave climate protest. Another 50,000 people took part in London. There is no lack of public awareness. Indeed, despite the levels of scepticism that remain, there is no lack of desire to take action, but the desire to take action and the actual taking of action are two different things. If newspaper reports are to be believed, Copenhagen has been swamped with some 1,200 limousines to chauffeur around people from the various delegations, and its airports will receive more than 140 private jets. That will happen while the city is hosting supposedly the most climate-conscious politicians in the world.</p><p>I say that not by way of criticism&#8212;although I would hardly applaud it&#8212;but to highlight that it is our actions and not our words that show our true commitment. Of course there will be times when we need to fly to places or travel by car, but each of us needs to consider carefully our actions and our carbon footprint. Engaging fully with the public and with industry is absolutely key if we are successfully to tackle climate change. Scotland's public engagement strategy is due to be published by the end of next year, but I take this opportunity strongly to encourage the minister to do everything in his power to accelerate that timescale as much as possible.

We also agree that the objectives of promoting social inclusion by allowing older and disabled people&#8212;especially those who are on low incomes&#8212;improved access to services, facilities and social networks through free use of scheduled bus services, and of improving health by promoting a more active lifestyle for the elderly and disabled are, largely, being met. However, they are not totally being met, as the scheme is not completely fair and equitable.</p><p>I will pre-empt interventions by saying that it could not have been easy to set up such an ambitious scheme from scratch, so I do not criticise the previous Executive for the omissions. After all, the Executive had the foresight to say that the scheme would have to be reviewed after three years to see what needed to be amended. However, that review, under the direction of the current Government, was ultimately a wasted opportunity. Although ministers had an opportunity to build on the groundbreaking travel schemes that the previous Administration introduced, little progress has been made. The only change that is recommended by the review is to extend free bus travel to seriously injured veterans. Although I support that and know that it will be welcome news to our war heroes, it just does not go far enough.</p><p>There are two areas in which a change in the scheme would redress some of the unfairness in the current system. First, I support Charlie Gordon's call for those on the lower level of disability living allowance to be eligible. Secondly, as set out in my amendment, proper consideration must be given to bringing rural community transport into the scheme. Addressing those two issues would make an immense difference to people who are trying to lead independent lives.<place-holder colnum=\"22045\"/></p><p>Extending the national concessionary travel scheme eligibility to include recipients of the lower rate of DLA has been advocated by several charities that represent people with disabilities. For example, Leonard Cheshire Disability has called for the scheme to be extended through its action for access campaign and the report \"Mind the Gap: The Next Step\". Although the inclusion of people on lower level DLA would undoubtedly increase the cost of the scheme, it would bring significant benefits by increasing social inclusion and promoting a more active and independent lifestyle for people with disabilities.</p><p>As WRVS points out in its briefing, research shows that, by keeping older and disabled people independent, active and connected in their communities, community transport makes people's lives better and improves their health, which is well in keeping with the aims of the national concessionary travel scheme. By helping to keep such people out of expensive acute and residential care, the public purse saves far more money than community transport costs to run. Community transport meets social need like no other transport service can. It is a cost-effective way of supporting some of society's most vulnerable people, and we must maintain it.</p><p>The Government must consider in an holistic way the costs and benefits of the two proposed changes. The cost of extending the scheme to all current community transport services has been estimated as no more than 3 per cent of the total budget for the scheme. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have long supported community and demand-responsive transport initiatives, as they provide a vital lifeline for communities who are served poorly or not at all by traditional bus services. In remote or rural locales, such schemes might be the only available viable public transport option. It is therefore crucial that the providers are supported in their operation and not discouraged.</p><p>It is worth noting that March 2008 marked the end of specific Scottish Government funding for community transport. The demise of the rural transport fund and demand-responsive transport grants as discrete funding pots has increased the pressure on those organisations. As local authority funding becomes tighter, lifeline services could well be put at risk, which would be a retrograde step. Recent research that was commissioned by WRVS shows that one in three older people cannot always get to where they want to go. That is certainly true in rural areas and it is why I am so keen for community transport to be brought into the equation.</p><p>My region contains the two great cities of Aberdeen and Dundee but, for the most part, it is a rural region taking in Aberdeenshire and Angus and with a widely dispersed population. For <place-holder colnum=\"22046\"/> example, Aberdeenshire is, geographically, one of the larger councils in Scotland. It has a population of slightly more than a quarter of a million, yet it has only six major towns with a population of more than 10,000 and not one of them reaches the 20,000 mark. The area has another 68 settlements and villages and, beyond that, about 68,500 people live outwith the towns and villages.</p><p>The majority of people have to travel to access health services, to study, work, or meet their social and leisure needs. Good commercial bus services are provided on the main routes into and out of Aberdeen, but there are much poorer links across country. Many rural residents rely on a range of community transport and demand-responsive transport services. I am sure that my colleague Jamie Stone could tell a similar story.</p><p>My point is that elderly and disabled rural residents get a poor deal. They might well have a concessionary card&#8212;at least those on full DLA&#8212;but they will not be able to get the benefit of it as mainstream bus services can be few and far between, if not completely non-existent. Elderly residents with relatives in a nursing home, or disabled people getting to work, rely utterly on those transport services.</p><p>The north-east has built up a strong tradition of social enterprises providing employment for disabled people. That kind of independent living must surely be encouraged. Why should not those on lower level disability living allowance be able to access free bus travel and take up those employment opportunities?</p><p>The minister will be familiar with those issues, representing as he does the Banff and Buchan constituency. I know that as a local MSP he has long supported community transport. Indeed, anyone who has experienced at first hand the rise and rise of Buchan dial-a-bus could not fail to be a convert to community transport. Buchan dial-a-bus, operating out of Maud, is a local transport charity providing a fully accessible transport service for people who have problems accessing public transport due to age, infirmity or rural exclusion. Last year it provided over 1,000 individuals with transport to hospitals.</p><p>When we debated the topic last year, the minister, Stewart Stevenson, responded directly to me in the chamber:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The member may recall that I secured a members' business debate on that subject in the previous session of Parliament, so she will know of my interest in it.

In any case, there simply is not enough funding to meet the target. One council warned me that not only is it unable to allocate enough money to deliver the meals but the rest of the schools budget may face future cuts due to tightening finances if it has to maintain the funding that it has allocated.</p><p>On class sizes, the Government needs to quickly rethink its attitude. How can it have the gall to criticise local authorities for not making progress towards delivering smaller class sizes in primary schools, when it knows full well that the money is simply not available to do so? One councillor explained the situation in their local authority to me very simply:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If the government doesn't provide increased funding, then reducing class sizes to 18 is simply impossible. And if the government does provide the extra money that's needed, there is no physical school space available, and no prospect of meeting the target within the Government's stated timeframe of this Parliament.\"</p><p>The scale of the task that the Government is demanding is easy to overlook. One of our smaller councils has calculated that, if it were to reduce all P1 to P3 classes to 18 and provide all the pupils with a free school lunch, the cost would be equivalent to 1 per cent of its total budget for this year. That is before it counts in the cost of improvements to kitchen facilities or expansion of school buildings, both of which would be needed. Things are even more startling when one looks at a large, chronically underfunded authority such as Aberdeen City Council, where the cost of meeting the targets is more like 9 per cent of its annual budget. Clearly, that money could be better spent elsewhere.</p><p>The nub of the problem is this: while the Government has spent its time arguing with local authorities, it has forgotten about what is important in education. It has let the curriculum for excellence stall&#8212;it has failed to provide the necessary funding and has still not clarified how the curriculum is to be reflected in examinations. Local authorities want to be able to fund the best possible education for their children, but they are not getting the support, funding or freedom that they need from Government.</p><p>I truly hope that those developments can be reversed and that the arrival of a new cabinet secretary will herald a change in the Government's education policy.

Women and children have the right to live free from the threat of violence.</p><p>We have an annual debate on the issue, and I am sure that we all agree that it would be great if it were not necessary to do so, but sadly, as Bill Aitken said, that day is still a long way off. The fact that levels of violence against women in Scotland are still extremely high ought to be, and is, a matter of grave concern to us all. As others have noted, the recording of 53,000 incidents of domestic abuse in 2008-09 represented an 8 per cent increase on the figure for the previous year. Each of those cases represents a human life in turmoil. The huge number of incidents is even more concerning given that, in many cases, domestic abuse is not reported to the police. Liberal Democrats have consistently called for the adoption of a zero tolerance approach. It must be made crystal clear that there is never any excuse for domestic abuse.</p><p>Ministers must tackle underlying factors that contribute to domestic abuse, notably drug and alcohol misuse but, fundamentally, there needs to be a culture change if we are to stamp out the problem once and for all. Repeat victimisation has been mentioned, and I agree that the number of such incidents is extremely concerning. We must give further consideration to how repeat offenders in particular are dealt with&#8212;the damage that is caused to partners and to the welfare of children demands no less. The domestic abuse task force that was established recently by Strathclyde Police has been referred to. That task force actively targets the most persistent offenders to protect those who are at high risk of serious violence and ultimately to reduce incidents of domestic homicide.</p><p>Progress has been made, but much more needs to be done. Violence against women continues to be a major social problem and a real challenge to all the agencies and individuals involved in prevention, protection and supporting. I acknowledge the contribution that voluntary sector <place-holder colnum=\"21746\"/> groups, particularly Scottish Women's Aid, Engender and Rape Crisis Scotland, have made in driving policy change and in practical support.</p><p>\"Safer Lives: Changed Lives\" rightly acknowledges that the solution lies in health services, local councils, the police, the voluntary sector and the justice authorities taking a shared approach. However, that document is not an action plan, and fine words alone will not effect the change that is needed. Having a shared understanding and taking a shared approach need to be kept at the forefront of everyone's minds every day, not just once a year, and they must be reflected in budget decisions and underpinned by safeguarded funding.</p><p>\"Safer Lives: Changed Lives\" identifies three priorities that I agree should be the three priorities: prevention, protection and provision. I will spend a little time on those.</p><p>Prevention is surely the hardest priority, as it involves changing culture. Many members have said that. It is appalling that one in two boys and one in three girls believes that there are some circumstances in which it is okay to hit a woman or to force her to have sex. It is clear that investment is needed in work that tackles root causes and creates an understanding of women's inequality as a cause and a consequence of violence against women.</p><p>On protection, Scotland's rape conviction rate of just 3.7 per cent is one of the lowest rape conviction rates in the world and the lowest in Europe. In August, the Liberal Democrats revealed that less than 10 per cent of rape cases went to court in 2007-08. It is obvious that much more needs to be done to improve the prosecution levels in rape cases in Scotland. It is not the place of politicians to interfere with the legal process, which must, of course, continue to allow people who have been accused of rape to have a fair trial, but the Government must ensure that victims of rapes can be confident that their case will be taken seriously, that they will be treated with sympathy, and that everything possible will be done to bring justified and provable cases to court.</p><p>The domestic abuse court in Glasgow has been successful in delivering faster and more effective justice, more convictions and better support for victims; the Liberal Democrats&#8212;particularly my colleague Robert Brown&#8212;have been vociferous in our support for that kind of specialist court. We were therefore disappointed when the Scottish Government did not rethink its decision not to roll out domestic abuse courts beyond the court in Glasgow. We are pleased to see the amendment in Bill Aitken's name. If specialist courts are available throughout Scotland and are seen to be dealing effectively with domestic abuse, more people will come forward to report incidents of <place-holder colnum=\"21747\"/> abuse. That would mean that more victims would get more help.</p><p>On provision, I was going to refer to the Scottish Women's Aid census on 24 September, but Cathy Peattie mentioned the figures in that. Of those figures, I was most concerned about the 47 women who requested refuge, the 12 women who were denied access to a refuge due to lack of space, and the five children who were turned away due to lack of space. Those figures are chilling. Some of those women had to return to their abusive partners.</p><p>It has been said that violence can have far-reaching and long-lasting effects. It can result in physical and psychological damage, isolation, low self-esteem and even economic losses as a result of people losing their jobs. Much more needs to be done to provide victims with practical help, emotional support and information to help them to escape from violence and recover from the experience of being a victim of violence.</p><p>With the squeeze on public sector funding, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that targeted funding is available for such critical work. Significant pressures are being put on the voluntary sector as a result of the local government concordat and single outcome agreements, as well as by local authorities' tight financial settlements. The situation is compounded by the effect of the recession on charity revenue and business investment. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations has described the current combination of effects as \"a perfect storm\". We should all be concerned by that.</p><p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission's map of gaps campaign highlighted the postcode lottery that exists in the United Kingdom in respect of support services for women who are the victims of violence. In Scotland, which has a female population of around 2.6 million, there are only 45 domestic violence services, 13 rape crisis centres and one sexual assault referral centre. Ring fencing funding is not always a solution, but the removal of ring-fenced funding for those services has been detrimental. Therefore, I welcome the significant counting the cost research that the Equality and Human Rights Commission Scotland has commissioned. Local authorities' funding and organisational decisions will be analysed. I hope that the Government will heed the findings when that research is published in the spring.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20429456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I am pleased to support the 16 days of activism against gender violence campaign and to pledge my continuing support for the elimination of violence against women.

Substantial increases in woodland cover and improvements to green space <place-holder colnum=\"21121\"/> and outdoor recreation are proposed, with the aim of improving landscape settings for towns and cities, including bringing back to life areas that face the post-industrial legacy of derelict and vacant land.</p><p>The network's inclusion in NPF 2 indicates that the Government considers the economic, health and social benefits of improving the landscape setting of towns and villages to be of national importance. However, the CSGN is quite different from the other national projects in the national planning framework, and will be difficult to deliver coherently and consistently.

Our current assessment is that this would need to be something of the order of &#163;5 million a year and that that might lever an equal amount from other sources.\"</p><p>FCS also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Elevation to National Development status raises expectation. Without additional resources it will be more difficult to deliver quickly something transformational on the ground.\"</p><p>That is why I have lodged my amendment today. I seek clarity from the Government on what its intentions are. The minister's comments are surprising. She is surely not telling us that the Government sets its budget without regard to its strategic plans. All that I am asking for is some information.</p><p>It is increasingly evident that good-quality green space contributes to boosting physical activity and mental health, attracting investment and creating places where people want to live. Urban green space can also help to mitigate the impacts of flooding, air pollution and high temperatures, as well as supporting wildlife. It can create an environment that encourages people to choose active lifestyles, including walking and cycling, and encourages children to play outside.</p><p>Greenspace Scotland's first report on the state of Scotland's green space gave a snapshot of progress in 20 out of 32 of our local authorities. It is an interesting report that will provide a good baseline for measurement in the future. However, it acknowledges that the full benefits of green <place-holder colnum=\"21122\"/> space are contingent on how it is used and valued by people.</p><p>Since 2004, Greenspace Scotland has commissioned three surveys of public opinion on urban green space, which have examined the use of green space, public attitudes about it and people's perceptions of local spaces. They show a rise in the use of local green space since 2004, primarily for physical activity and relaxation. In the most recent survey, 63 per cent of respondents said that they used their local green space once a week or more often, which was up from 49 per cent in 2004. Half of those polled could walk to their local green space within five minutes, but that dropped to 39 per cent in more deprived areas.</p><p>The Scottish household survey in 2007-08 also included a section on green space. It found that people's level of satisfaction with their green space was positively associated with how they felt about their neighbourhood overall. It also revealed a connection between green space and health, with self-reported health being 10 per cent higher in areas with a safe and pleasant environment.</p><p>There is no doubt that good-quality green space aids personal health and wellbeing and contributes to tackling climate change. It will also help us to adapt to some of the impacts of climate change, and, importantly, it contributes to community wellbeing through the creation of a sense of belonging.</p><p>Although there are many examples of good practice&#8212;at the local authority planning level and from the many trusts and organisations that champion the environment, such as green space trusts, SNH, the woods in and around towns programme, the SWT and the Ramblers Association&#8212;far too many communities are surrounded by wasteland or barren stretches of green deserts. There has been a drive for improvement in housing stock, but the setting in which that housing has been situated has not always been improved. Planning decisions have placed too much emphasis on the built environment and have paid scant attention to securing good breathing space between developments. At the moment, central Scotland has a patchwork of green rather than a network.</p><p>Greenspace Scotland also asked about barriers to increasing use of green space, and many respondents highlighted concerns about maintenance, lack of facilities and safety. Those issues must be tackled by the CSGN. I would like the CSGN to ensure that communities are involved all the way through the process, and I ask ministers to outline how they envisage them being represented on the network's board. It is not always the case that communities are involved in the design and management of their local spaces, but when they are it can help to build a strong <place-holder colnum=\"21123\"/> sense of belonging. Placemaking projects have demonstrated that. Taking into account communities' views from the outset should ensure that the new green spaces meet the needs of all users, and should address safety concerns.</p><p>With the growing pressure on council budgets over the next few years, proper consideration must also be given to arrangements for the maintenance of space that is created. I note that the NPF action plan anticipates that, by the end of 2010, there will be a report on the preferred management structures and processes to safeguard the green network into the future. That is essential.</p><p>The CSGN is an unusual project to be included in the NPF, but its designation as a national development means that we can expect a level of co-ordination and intervention on a scale that has been previously unknown. That is welcome.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-5173.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"; notes the view of Forestry Commission Scotland that, without additional resources to invest in the Central Scotland Green Network, it will be difficult to deliver transformational change on the ground, and calls on the Scottish Government to clarify within the next six weeks its funding and delivery intentions for all the national developments in the National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 and how they link to the Scottish Government's current expenditure proposals.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20375795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Central Scotland Green Network"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The designation of the central Scotland green network as a national project is to be welcomed and will, I hope, presage a significant and sustained emphasis on improving the natural environment of the 3 million or so people who live within the 19 local authority areas that will be covered by the network.

During the terms of office of our Lib Dem transport ministers, much groundwork was carried out. Like the foundations of a house, groundwork is not visible, but it is vital. We identified the project, carried out preparatory work, built the project into the regional plan and started negotiations with Network Rail. A great deal of work was carried out in the early days. The disappointment is that that work has not been taken forward.</p><p>I will focus on what we can do now. I understand that, as part of the process of working towards the rail improvement priorities that have been identified by the Government, Network Rail has prepared for Transport Scotland its proposals for the Inverness to Aberdeen line. I have been told <place-holder colnum=\"20359\"/> that the proposals include looking at the case for a new station at Kintore. That is, of course, welcome news.</p><p>The minister will recall the commitment that he made to me personally late last year that he would look at reviewing the forecast passenger number calculations as well as disaggregating the costs of the main Aberdeen to Inverness line improvements from those of the local project, because it was when the two projects were pooled that things started to get difficult. I am glad to have heard from the minister already during the debate that he is looking at a new model for passenger patronage. I think that that will benefit the Kintore project. I was grateful for the minister's commitment and I trust that he will ensure that Transport Scotland remembers it during its discussions on the proposals. I believe that if ever a project needed political direction, it is this one. I would be interested to hear whether the minister has updated figures that he may be able to share with the chamber this evening or even in the next few weeks.</p><p>Obviously, given the overwhelming success of the new station at Laurencekirk, I feel that it is even more vital that updated projected passenger figures are used when considering Kintore. Even with the currently available figures, I am certain of the case for the new station and I have no doubt that Nestrans, Aberdeenshire Council and the other local bodies are similarly convinced. Again, I refer to the petition that I handed to the minister last year, which showed overwhelming support for the proposal. I expect revised forecasts that take figures from Laurencekirk into account will only strengthen the case.</p><p>I am informed that Nestrans already feels that a new station at Kintore should be progressed as soon as possible, perhaps initially as a single-platform station, and in advance of any finalised proposals for the fuller developments on the Aberdeen to Inverness line. In other words, we should not simply wait until we have the full package. I hope that the minister and Transport Scotland will continue to work closely with Nestrans on the matter&#8212;I certainly will&#8212;and that firm plans for the station can be brought forward at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Turning from Kintore to the wider crossrail project, I think that it is obvious that in the current climate it is not realistic to do the whole thing in one go. However, it is equally obvious that we should not simply forget about it, and I am very pleased to hear that Government officials have been working with the local authorities on the plans. I encourage them and the minister to continue to listen closely to people's views and to be careful not to dismiss the long-term ideas that Mike Rumbles has espoused purely on the basis <place-holder colnum=\"20360\"/> that they are too expensive right now. It is okay to implement crossrail incrementally, but there needs to be an identifiable long-term plan.</p><p>As the minister with responsibility for planning, Mr Stevenson will be aware of the Aberdeen city and shire long-term structure plan. Approved by him without going to inquiry and held up as a model by the Scottish Government's chief planner, the plan identifies transport corridors, one of which is Huntly to Laurencekirk, as key areas of future growth and envisages that the growth of the corridor and the crossrail project will be somewhat symbiotic. The building of crossrail will support sustainable growth, which in turn will bolster passenger numbers, and I urge that the model be remembered in discussions or plans.</p><p>I hope that when the plans for the Inverness to Aberdeen line are finalised they will improve local suburban services to the north of Aberdeen. That would certainly be a good first step&#8212;or a good second step, if Kintore station has been opened by then. However, I ask the minister to remind Transport Scotland that it should not be satisfied with that and that it should bear in mind the bigger picture and that comprehensive improvements, including a regular service from Inverurie to Stonehaven and further station reopenings, must be the ultimate goal.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20206468", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aberdeen Crossrail (Kintore Station)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, am grateful to my colleague Mike Rumbles for giving us the opportunity to further discuss the proposed new station at Kintore and the wider Aberdeen crossrail project.

I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to see for myself the work that they do, and I can tell members that I have never been less than hugely impressed.</p><p>Over the past few years, each of those colleges has been publicly recognised for the innovative and excellent practices and programmes that it has introduced. An example of the excellent work that is going on that is of particular interest to me is the partnership that has been set up between Banff and Buchan College, a local business and a local school, which has the aim of increasing the number of young women who take up engineering. The programme, which was set up in response to concern about the number of suitably qualified women being recruited to engineering jobs, provides female role models from business to mentor an all-girls group and sponsors visits to various industrial sites. As well as encouraging more girls to consider pursuing a career in engineering, the scheme certainly provides the girls who participate with a highly desirable and transferable skill set, regardless of the path that they take.</p><p>The fact that Banff and Buchan College has a number of permanent outreach centres makes it truly local. It has demonstrated repeatedly that it is flexible, responsive to changing demand and innovative, despite not always getting its fair share of resources.</p><p>Aberdeen College has linked up with the Robert Gordon University to create the degree link programme, which is improving the progression from HND courses at the college to degree courses and making the transition a smoother process for students.</p><p>Dundee College has teamed up with a local hotel on its classroom to industry programme, which supports disaffected learners with limited employment prospects and develops their employability through vocational training in hospitality and professional cookery.</p><p>At Angus College, socially and educationally excluded young people are engaged through the skillzone, which is a programme through which educational access is provided at times to meet the individual's needs. By working with partners, the programme seeks to create personalised learning approaches, in an effort to overcome the effects of poor previous learning experiences. Performance indicators show that the scheme has a remarkable success rate, in both student retention and outcome. The skillzone is just one more example of how colleges&#8212;by providing tailored, individual teaching, targeted and vocational learning, and highly specialised <place-holder colnum=\"20258\"/> support&#8212;are able to play a key role in helping young people to develop and, ultimately, be successful in finding employment.</p><p>I would be happy to talk about success stories from the north-east for the rest of the afternoon, but I must turn to an issue that the cabinet secretary is no doubt familiar with and which others have mentioned&#8212;the recent allocation of additional funding for colleges and the fact that rural colleges' needs have been overlooked in that funding round. As Fiona Hyslop may have anticipated, in particular I want to discuss the fact that Angus College has been overlooked both for additional revenue funding and capital funding.</p><p>I still await with great interest substantive answers to a number of questions that I lodged recently, in which I asked about the criteria that were used to determine which colleges should receive a share of the funds.

I hope that the councils, the unions and all the other partners that are involved will be galvanised into more concerted action to resolve the issues that the committee has highlighted. I want more urgency to be brought to the matter, as almost every other member in the chamber has said today.</p><p>Investing even more time and effort will not only benefit the tens of thousands of women who are still waiting to be treated fairly, but will limit councils' liability in equal pay claims that come through the courts in the future. It is truly time, as many members have noted, that the matter was properly resolved.</p><p>It is clear from the report that councils are still sitting on a financial timebomb; David McLetchie identified that the cost is about &#163;600 million and still rising. Councils will welcome the cabinet secretary's announcement of a capitalisation scheme for retrospective payments at least, <place-holder colnum=\"20180\"/> provided that it is adequate; I hope that the cabinet secretary will give us more clarity on that.</p><p>As many members have said today, the single status agreement was originally signed 10 years ago, in 1999, and the rate of progress since then has been painfully slow. It is clear from the report that the longer the matter drags on, the harder it is to resolve, as more and more court rulings are reached. I agree with the committee's view that if single status had been implemented earlier, a number of the legal challenges would not have come about.</p><p>In paragraph 25 of the committee's report, a witness from COSLA is quoted as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have a legal obligation to introduce equal pay. We will continue to do that as quickly as we can, but the negotiations have been the most difficult, protracted and complex that I have ever been involved in. Every time there are judgements ... the process is set back.\"</p><p>It is clear that the situation will only get worse unless all parties bring some stronger resolve to the matter.</p><p>Two of the most urgent points that arise from the report concern the settling of equal pay claims and equal pay audits. All the parties involved should be embarrassed that, as many members have pointed out, more than 35,000 equal pay claims have now been lodged with tribunals. That does not include, as members have said, those women who have retired or died and not been able to bring claims. Everything possible must be done to bring those to closure.</p><p>The convener of the Local Government and Communities Committee said earlier that strong cases should be settled, and paragraph 53 of the report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee agrees that it would not be a good use of public money for local authorities to settle cases they believe have no validity. However, it also believes that it serves no-one well (least of all the claimants) for strong cases not to be settled. This is particularly true of cases where the main issue is not over whether discrimination has occurred, but is over the level of compensation.\"</p><p>I therefore agree with Margaret Mitchell and others and commend the following recommendation in paragraph 72:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee is firmly of the view that all of the parties concerned (councils, trade unions, COSLA and lawyers) should be brought together, to enter into discussions over the potential settling of strong cases that are currently within the system.\"</p><p>Like others, I urge the cabinet secretary to do all that he can to facilitate such a meeting.</p><p>I turn to the need for equal pay audits. I was astounded to discover that the committee heard in evidence that the new pay schemes that some councils are implementing have not necessarily been equality proofed. While any doubt remains <place-holder colnum=\"20181\"/> about that, we will continue to face the possibility that even more equal pay claims will be lodged. The report contains a number of examples. Mark Irvine from Action 4 Equality gave the example of Glasgow City Council. He said that the new structure in Glasgow might well be discriminatory, given that the vast majority of part-time workers, who do not qualify, are women.</p><p>The recommendations in paragraphs 112 to 114 go into some detail on what should be done in new pay and grading agreements and state that we need a consistent approach. Paragraph 112 proposes an independent assessment and states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Committee suggests there should be a clause stating that local authorities will undertake any necessary adjustments to their schemes as recommended by the independent assessment.\"</p><p>Comments have also been made this morning about the role of Audit Scotland and the suggestion that, through best-value audits, it should check and report on whether the local authority's scheme has been equality proofed.</p><p>Paragraph 114 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"On the issue of regular reviews, the Committee recommends that local authorities undertake an annual equal pay audit, if they are not already doing so\".</p><p>I would like to see mandatory pay audits in both the public and private sectors. What are the cabinet secretary's views on that?</p><p>The historical undervaluing of women's work is a disgrace and it is indefensible to allow it to carry on today, yet women are still being undervalued and poorly paid.

I admit that a matrix of organisations is involved in improving road safety and, like the Government, I acknowledge the individual's role. However, the very fact that so many organisations are involved means that strong leadership will be required from the Government if there is not to be a diffusion of effort.</p><p>The need to lower the drink-driving limit is well documented.

Research has shown that children in the lowest <place-holder colnum=\"19777\"/> socioeconomic groups are over four times more likely to be killed as pedestrians than those in the highest socioeconomic group, which is unacceptable. In that context, the changes to funding for safer routes to school and the threats to the Sustrans budget must be reviewed to ensure a continued focus on those problems.</p><p>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the framework, however, is the lack of attention placed on the issue of rural roads. Only three pages of the 154-page strategy are dedicated to tackling road safety in non-built-up areas, yet those roads tragically account for 75 per cent of all accidents. We must tackle those shocking figures by introducing specific targeted measures to improve the safety record of Scotland's rural roads. It is not enough for ministers to simply say in the document that they will continue to support current schemes or consider further action.</p><p>Driver training and more driving practice before solo driving are really important. We let down our young people by not ensuring that they are equipped to deal with the demands of rural driving. Preparing our young people to be safer drivers must be a priority. The Executive's research on rural road safety, published last year, identified the lack of adequate driver training as one of the main failings. I ask the Government again to develop a new, improved pass-plus scheme to operate throughout Scotland, harnessing, if possible, sponsorship from insurance companies and targeting those most at risk&#8212;young male drivers&#8212;to ensure that they are properly equipped with the skills to drive on rural roads.</p><p>Some problems on rural trunk roads require engineering solutions.

I congratulate Girlguiding Scotland on reaching its first centenary. I had a very pleasant break this afternoon when, with some of my colleagues, I popped out to meet the representatives who had rallied outside Parliament. The dancing and the festive feeling to the afternoon were really pleasant. As Maureen Watt mentioned, last weekend 1,500 rainbows, brownies, girl guides, adult volunteers and former members marched through Inverurie&#8212;one of my local towns&#8212;to celebrate the centenary. There was a real carnival atmosphere to the procession, with banners and a steel band. Those numbers <place-holder colnum=\"19576\"/> are, in themselves, enough to show how vibrant the girlguiding movement still is.</p><p>The movement now sees groups of positive-thinking girls in virtually every community in Scotland. In the north-east of Scotland, there are waiting lists for girls who want to join the rainbows, brownies and guides. I therefore issue a plea to communities across the north-east to think about volunteering and working with girlguiding groups. Accommodation is not a problem&#8212;there is plenty of that&#8212;but it can be difficult to attract volunteers to train as leaders, and without leaders the units cannot increase their capacity. I know that modern work and family pressures make it hard to find the time to volunteer, but I urge people to give it a go. Every leader to whom I have spoken has commented on how much fun it is and how rewarding it is to work alongside their packs in that environment.</p><p>Guiding groups not only offer opportunities to girls and young women, but help, through the strong networks that they build, to sustain neighbourhoods and communities. It is therefore disappointing to note that in Banff and Buchan there are 97 girls on the waiting list and we are looking for 24 leaders. In the Gordon section, 221 girls are waiting to take part in the activities and we would need about 55 new leaders to allow them all to participate. In Kincardine and Deeside, 164 girls are on the waiting list; in Angus, 190 girls are on the waiting list; and in Aberdeen, 310 girls are on the waiting list. We need a lot of new leaders, so I hope that the extra publicity that the centenary will give the organisation will encourage people to come forward. Perhaps former guides will think about coming back and helping a new generation.</p><p>I was proud to learn that three Scottish girl guides were in the first all-girl crew to sail the Lord Nelson in the tall ships race out of Liverpool to M&#229;l&#248;y, in Norway, last year. The crew of 40 girl guides were of mixed ability, with a proportion of them having sensory or physical limitations. Their achievement was very commendable, indeed.</p><p>As other members have said, guiding has changed over the years to keep up with the times. Not only is the uniform a lot more trendy than I remember, but there are lots of choices within the badges and the work that the girls do, which allows them to reflect their own personalities. Like Nanette Milne, I am quite envious of the range of options that are now open to the girls and young women. The badges that they work so hard for are creative and visionary, and they include serious things such as environmental issues. The five principles on which guiding is based&#8212;putting girls at the centre, focusing on shared decision making, respect for the individual, commitment to a common standard and participation in a balanced <place-holder colnum=\"19577\"/> and varied programme&#8212;are all things that stand women in good stead throughout their lives.</p><p>As a former brownie and girl guide, I know that there are many benefits to joining the girl guides. I was delighted recently to be invited by the Gordon guides to be an ambassador. Given the least opportunity, I am happy to advocate for guiding and to explain its benefits of self-development, experience of team working, leadership development, development of the ability to challenge and the wide group of friends that a girl can get from being in the guides. Those are all things that we need to foster if we are to have an active and successful society.</p><p>I have enjoyed the festivities in Edinburgh today, and I hope to share in some of the forthcoming centenary events in my area.

We have had significant contributions, such as that from Paul Martin, who raised valid points about fairness and the need to tackle the currently fragmented approach to discipline and grievance procedures in the employing services. Robert Brown stated that we need greater clarity on the division of responsibility. He and Stewart Maxwell mentioned the inspection requirements under the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005. I would particularly appreciate the minister's response on that. Stewart Maxwell spoke well about his campaign to ensure that only RIP cigarettes are sold in <place-holder colnum=\"19474\"/> Scotland. I will certainly pay more heed to his campaigning from now on. Peter Peacock, who was, as ever, succinct and to the point, asked for more detail on water rescue and on the training and resources that will be needed for the implementation of the Tomkins report. Cathie Craigie spoke about the need for continuous training to a national standard. She and Angela Constance talked about the need to maintain front-line services. I hope that the minister will pick up on those points.</p><p>The minister opened the debate by paying tribute to Ewan Williamson from Edinburgh, who died in the line of duty. We all associate ourselves with the minister's sentiments, which have been echoed by all speakers.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats recognise the vital work of fire and rescue services throughout Scotland, including the contribution of the firefighters in the retained duty system, who provide a flexible and cost-effective community service, particularly in rural, remote and island parts of Scotland. We support local flexibility in service delivery, but we note the concerns of the FBU, which is calling for clear and enforceable standards and clear responsibilities. We therefore believe that the fire and rescue advisory unit and the ministerial advisory group must work effectively with fire and rescue authorities to deliver compliance within agreed and consistent objectives under the national framework.</p><p>Our amendment highlights the role of retained firefighters, which many members have mentioned. My region of North East Scotland is covered by Tayside Fire and Rescue and Grampian Fire and Rescue Service. Grampian has 33 retained fire stations and only three full-time ones. Tayside has 24 stations, of which three are volunteer and four are whole time, with the other 17 being retained. They provide fire and rescue services to a region that has busy industrial harbours, major oil and gas terminals, and the busiest heliport in the country. We also have two major hospital campuses, including the biggest single-site hospital in Europe.</p><p>Retained firefighters provide fire cover for at least 90 per cent of the landmass of Scotland, which is no mean feat. I must also mention volunteer firefighters, who work at remote stations. Tayside has three stations that are operated by volunteers, at Kinloch Rannoch, Glenshee and Kirkmichael. Those volunteers show an exceptional level of commitment, for which I thank them.</p><p>As the minister said, the framework recognises the changing role of the fire and rescue service. We now have a modern service that is about much more than firefighting: it is a comprehensive fire and rescue service, which, as the minister rightly <place-holder colnum=\"19475\"/> said, puts prevention on a par with intervention. The service attends car crashes, flooding incidents and landslips, and carries out a lot of prevention work in the form of home safety visits and school work.</p><p>As the Liberal Democrat transport spokesperson, I am increasingly aware that, certainly in my area, firefighters' time is taken up with responding to road traffic incidents. I therefore welcome the framework's focus on reducing death and injury caused by road traffic accidents. It is telling that, as we debate the issue, the Chief Fire Officers Association is hosting a major conference in Glasgow to explore the unique role of the fire and rescue service in reducing the appalling effects of road traffic collisions.</p><p>The minister spoke about co-operation and partnership. I will highlight an example from my region. Road safety Grampian is a pioneering partnership with Grampian Police in which three members of fire service staff are based permanently at Nelson Street police office in Aberdeen. Those staff members are part of Grampian fire and rescue service's risk reduction unit that is managed by community safety and is under the overall control of central support services. The unit has crew managers, police officers and support staff working together in the same base. The ultimate target of the partnership is to contribute to the key strategic objective on which we just touched&#8212;reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries caused by road traffic collisions.</p><p>We heard this morning that the fire and rescue service has to deal with a sometimes hostile public, with at least 200 attacks a year, which is an appalling number. Paul Martin and Elaine Smith rightly highlighted the dangers of attacks and, indeed, the need for legal protection.</p><p>I will touch on something that is highlighted in the framework but which no one has mentioned this morning. Changing societal norms mean that duty systems that were developed over the past century do not necessarily meet the needs of 21<sup>st</sup> century families and communities. If we are to cope with the projected increase in retirements and also have a diverse and representative fire and rescue service, the service will need to monitor carefully recruitment and retention, and develop initiatives to recruit the next generation of firefighters.</p><p>We will support the motion and Labour's amendment. In closing, I pay tribute to the sterling work that our fire and rescue service provides&#8212;a service that my colleague Robert Brown defined rightly as one of compassionate competence. I urge the Government to ensure that the national framework provides only strategic guidance, encourages appropriate enforceable national <place-holder colnum=\"19476\"/> standards and at all times ensures that we respect local autonomy.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire and Rescue Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate has been constructive and many useful points have been raised that I hope the minister will address in his summing-up speech.

I thank whole-heartedly the committee clerks whose endless work and late nights made the complexity understandable and the process smooth. I must also thank the thousands of people who responded to the initial consultation last year and the many lobbyists who have contacted me since that time. Their thoughts, insights and arguments were an invaluable help.</p><p>Most important, I thank the hundreds of my constituents who wrote asking me to help make the bill a world beater. I say to them that I tried my hardest to strengthen the bill. Their letters, emails and telephone calls provided me with the encouragement of knowing that my position on the bill was the right one.</p><p>Another stage 3 tradition dictates that I welcome the constructive nature of the proceedings, the excellence of the bill that we are passing and the <place-holder colnum=\"18796\"/> positive impact that it will have. I hope that members will forgive me for saying that I cannot be quite as fulsome in that regard as I may have wished to be. Two months ago, I told members that it was a privilege to have the opportunity to work on the bill&#8212;and it was. I also said that I wanted to be proud of the bill. I am proud of many parts of it. Parts of it will make good things happen and stand us in good stead for the future. We have agreed on the inclusion of a cumulative emissions budget, which is a huge step in ensuring that our emissions reduction targets are properly based on the science of what is needed; that will truly make a difference. After much campaigning, sectoral targets have been included. They will help to ensure that every part of Scotland's economy will play its role in reducing emissions. We have committed to including emissions from aviation and shipping in the emissions accounts from the outset. That truly sets an example for the world to follow. The Government has also adopted our proposal to introduce an iterative process for analysing, questioning and working to improve the proposals that it will put forward on policies that will, I hope, meet the targets that have been set. I will always be proud of having played a part in making those things law.</p><p>I am not, sadly, totally satisfied with everything that we will agree to today. We have all echoed the same words from the start. We have said that the bill is the most important bill that the Parliament will pass and that we must show real ambition. So far, we have heard quite a lot of self-congratulation; I fear that I am about to dampen down the celebrations a little. [<em>Interruption.</em>] I hear the groans.</p><p>Party lines should have been set aside in considering the bill. We should have united in pushing for far-reaching targets and worked for consensus right from the start. I have been genuinely disappointed that that has not happened. A little analysis of what we got on the journey is necessary. We got broken manifesto commitments from the Scottish National Party. We then got its ambition not to set the world an example, but to imitate what had already been done at Westminster. Finally, when the SNP was in danger of being left behind, there was a belated understanding that there was a true desire in Scotland for us to take action that will make a difference.</p><p>I am sorry that Labour prevaricated a lot. That was followed by what seemed to be a sudden rush to get in on the act. It seems that the ambition was to get headlines, not to get early action. There was a desperate late scramble to try to make up for missed opportunities at stage 2.</p><p>The word \"disinterested\" probably best describes the Tories' approach. There was not <place-holder colnum=\"18797\"/> much sign of David Cameron's vote blue, go green delusions. I am sorry; I meant to say aspirations.</p><p>Despite the strengthening of annual targets that our agreement to introduce a cumulative budget will bring, I remain sceptical about the showpiece amendment that we agreed to earlier, which will put the interim target at 42 per cent with strings attached. I want it to stay at 42 per cent, but I fear that it might not do so much past the end of the year. Over the next six months, it is our responsibility to make the case that Scotland can achieve that target&#8212;that our emissions can be 42 per cent lower than the baseline by 2020. We must aim high.</p><p>As Sarah Boyack said, the bill is not the solution; rather, it is an opportunity for us to take the initiative and show that Scotland can lead the way.

An 80 per cent reduction by 2050 is equivalent to 3 per cent annual reductions if and only if the 80 per cent target is met by making annual reductions of 3 per cent.</p><p>I will explain, and I must again talk about cumulative emissions. Let us imagine two trajectories towards the 80 per cent target: in one, the interim target is 34 per cent, and 3 per cent annual reductions kick in after 2020; in the other, the interim target is 42 per cent and the 3 per cent annual reductions happen from the outset. Those trajectories are not equivalent. The start and end points are the same, but the bit in the middle&#8212;the important bit&#8212;is far from the same. On the first trajectory, we emit nearly 1,500 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent. On the second, we emit just more than 1,300 million tonnes. The difference is about 142 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, or nearly three times the total emissions for Scotland in 2006. The two trajectories are not equivalent.</p><p>That is why it is vital that we take early action. We need 3 per cent annual reductions now.

After all, the route that we take towards the 2050 target of an 80 per cent reduction on 1990 emissions levels is just as important as reaching that destination. To explain what I mean, I will link my comments to my later amendments on cumulative emissions. Although we can reach the same end via a 34 per cent or 42 per cent target&#8212;or indeed any number in between&#8212;our impact on the earth's atmosphere depends very much on our chosen route. Such <place-holder colnum=\"18678\"/> point-in-time targets are not simply abstract numbers but represent real quantifiable amounts of emissions, and the greater the early action that we take, the better our chance of limiting the damage of climate change.</p><p>Early action is vital. A weaker interim target means not only more emissions between now and 2020, but more emissions in every year between 2020 and 2050. As a result, the target will affect not only the next 10 years but the next 40.</p><p>I am concerned about the framing of amendment 94. For example, I am by no means encouraged by its reference to 40 per cent as the target \"for the time being\"; I am not encouraged by its separation of the reference to \"a higher figure\" from the reference to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a figure provided by the relevant body\",</p><p>in referring to any modification of the interim target&#8212;a caveat, I might add, that opens the door to lowering the target after today's figure grabs the headlines; and I am not encouraged by yesterday's letter from the UK Committee on Climate Change to the minister that suggests that its initial view is that an appropriate target might be \"slightly below 34%\". That view appears to be based on limited information and on matters that have not been fully investigated. I trust that, given time, the Committee on Climate Change will come to realise that Scotland can do more. That Scotland must do more is by now, I hope, a given.</p><p>We will back the Government's amendment 94A, which seeks to increase the \"for the time being\" target to 42 per cent, as that is the figure backed by the science and represents the cut that the evidence says is required. It will be difficult to reach that target, but we must make the effort to do so. I hope that, after today, sense will prevail and that an order weakening the target that we will agree to will not be made. I would oppose any such move, and I am certain that the rest of Scotland would too.</p><p>The bill is a signature piece of legislation for the Scottish Parliament.

It needs tougher targets, a greater depth and a robust reporting mechanism so that successive Governments can be held accountable for the rate of progress in this most pressing matter.</p><p>Over the past year, the Government has regularly made claims about its bill being an example for the world to follow&#8212;it could never be accused of modesty. Is the bill world leading? Not yet. At the moment, it is so lacking on early action that there is no certainty that the end target can be achieved, but I welcome the cabinet secretary's comments on that and will reflect on what he said.</p><p>For two years, the Government has promised effective legislation on climate change. I do not want it to shirk its responsibility now because the task is difficult. In contrast to the SNP, the Liberal Democrats are determined that the bill should fulfil its potential and set a global example to other developed nations.</p><p>Scotland must not waste the chance to show the world the way in legislating on climate change. The bill does not do that, but it could and should. I hope that there is cross-party support for further strengthening of the bill and for my amendment. Change can happen if enough people will it, and we have seen an enormous upsurge of interest in tackling climate change. That support from across the country should galvanise us and strengthen our resolve. People are asking us to be bold and will not forgive us if we are timid about it.</p><p>This is not about political point scoring; it is about doing what is necessary. As a Parliament, we can unite to make the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill a strong and effective bill that will ensure early and sustained action. We can signal that we want to grasp the opportunity, kick-start <place-holder colnum=\"17095\"/> change and give Scotland a positive edge and renewed confidence in moving forward.</p><p>Yesterday, the Government published its response to the committee's recommendations. In some instances, what is proposed still falls short of expectations. I will address that issue alongside some of the main issues of the report and the bill.</p><p>The most disappointing aspect of the bill may be the lack of early action that is proposed. Yes, targets would be set from the outset, but there is no mention of the SNP's promised 3 per cent annual cuts until 2020 and no interim target until 2030, although the minister has admitted that he will move the interim target to 2020, in line with the UK bill. I am eternally hopeful that he will introduce measures for real, early action.</p><p>Simply requiring a reduction each year until 2019 shows a lack of ambition and, more worrying, a reluctance to take responsibility. It is all very well for the minister to say that that approach will \"balance science and achievability\", but he cannot duck the facts. The science is simple and it indicates that urgent action is needed now. The committee report recommends early and sustained action, which I believe should mean cuts of 3 per cent per annum from the outset. The Met Office puts it simply:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Even if emissions start to decrease in the next two years and reach a rapid and sustained rate of decline of 3% per year, temperatures are likely to rise to 1.7 &#176;C above pre-industrial levels by 2050 ... the risks of dangerous climate change will not increase slowly as greenhouse gases increase. Rather, the risks will multiply if we do not reduce emissions fast enough.\"</p><p>Turning to cumulative emissions, I think that science is probably driving the composition of this bill more than it has that of any other. Percentage reductions are a necessary measure of progress, but the science of climate change speaks not in percentages but in absolutes. The key to success lies in the total amount of greenhouse gases that we release into the atmosphere. We know that the current concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about 387 parts per million. Climate change prediction models are constantly updated, but we know that to have even half a chance of limiting climate change to a global temperature rise of 2&#176;, we would need to stabilise the concentration at no more than 450 parts per million of CO<sub>2</sub>. If we reached 550 parts per million before stabilising, we would be more likely to have a 3&#176; or 4&#176; temperature rise, with all the damaging effects that would go with that.</p><p>What that means is that we have a real, scientifically measurable limit on how much CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent we, as a world, can emit over the next 10, 20, or 50 years. From that, we can work out what Scotland's fair share of those emissions will be. With that in hand, it would almost be <place-holder colnum=\"17096\"/> irresponsible not to measure our cumulative emissions, report on them and track whether we are staying within bounds.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14962557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I look forward to the bill progressing to stage 2 following this week's debate but, through my amendment, I want to highlight some of the key changes that are needed to make it fit for purpose.

A 34 per cent target for 2020 is not challenging enough. Simply hitting 3 per cent each year, which is what the Government committed to do, would lead to a 43 per cent reduction by 2020. Indeed, more recent projections have suggested that our ambition for the bill should be a 50 per cent reduction. We must have an interim target that encourages early action and annual targets that do the same. It is not just me who says so: the committee heard time and again that early action is needed. Not only the environmental lobby but businesses and public bodies said that.</p><p>An ambitious target for 2050 is not enough. There must be a road map for getting there. Without proper interim targets and with no steep trajectory, we are left with the impression that the Government is happy to wait for technical fixes to be developed that will solve all our problems. We will need technology to help us, but we can do things now in the short term, such as pushing building insulation measures and promoting better fuel efficiency and greater energy efficiency. We can do things that will set us well on our way to the reductions that we need to make and which will give us time to work on the bigger fixes. Moreover, far from costing billions, they could save us all money.</p><p>Turning to sectoral targets, I believe that everyone will need to take action if the bill is to succeed.

Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will not die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistence.\"</p><p>We should take that approach to high-speed rail. It is time to act and make a big plan. What better way for the UK Government to signal confidence in the country than to embark on a major infrastructure project to unite the whole UK?</p><p>High-speed rail promises economic development benefits through opening up new markets, reducing travelling time and incidentally harnessing travelling time as useful working time. It promises rail capacity improvements on new and existing lines, and would of course have significant environmental benefits. A high-speed line connecting London to Edinburgh and Glasgow, with journey times of around three hours, and with good onward connections into our existing rail network, would inspire confidence, create jobs and provide a viable alternative to domestic and European air travel. We have witnessed the <place-holder colnum=\"16622\"/> benefits of high speed 1; let us be ambitious about high speed 2.</p><p>I would like to turn some of the current thinking on its head. As the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is only when greater distances are travelled that the speed element truly gives benefit. It makes a very large difference to lop two hours off journey time from Edinburgh or Glasgow to London (85% travelling by air currently) compared to (say) Newcastle (under 60% using air) which already has that two hour advantage. By the time we regard Birmingham to London the time savings are minimal.\"</p><p>How, then, can it be that while all parties undoubtedly are interested in high-speed rail, some parties plan to treat Scotland as an afterthought at a later date? I believe that any high-speed blueprint must be comprehensive and plan for Anglo-Scottish links from the outset, so that they are properly integrated.</p><p>Until recently, as has been said, Westminster was lukewarm about the benefits of high-speed rail, but the agenda has moved on a little, although I believe that that change was driven more by the need to soften the blow of a third runway at Heathrow than by a genuine commitment to a more sustainable transport pattern. Lord Adonis, despite seeming to have a genuine interest in rail, has let Scotland down by instructing High Speed Two to concentrate on a new line from London to the west midlands. However, perhaps his recent rail odyssey around Britain will have encouraged him to think again&#8212;I hope so. I know that we will all press the case with him tomorrow.</p><p>The committee report makes a number of recommendations: we should aim for a three-hour, capital-to-capital journey time; any new line must serve both Edinburgh and Glasgow in order to maximise the benefits for Scotland; and the termini must be in city centres, which will be a challenge, but we must overcome it.</p><p>The majority of the evidence that we heard suggested that high-speed rail should use conventional rail technology rather than maglev. I agree, because maglev is a distraction. Conventional rail is more flexible and will allow us to maximise connections by using existing rail where necessary.</p><p>It is worth emphasising that the development of a new link to London must go hand in hand with improvements to our regional rail networks. As someone from the north-east, I suggest that a high-speed link from London to the central belt will be of little use to businesses in Aberdeen and Inverness if the connecting journey takes just as long. All of Scotland must benefit from the high-speed link&#8212;I welcome the minister's comments on that&#8212;otherwise we will relegate our northern towns and cities to economic marginalisation.<place-holder colnum=\"16623\"/></p><p>The SNP manifesto pledged that the Scottish Government would</p><p class=\"indent\">\"match the best on offer elsewhere in Europe\".</p><p>However, when questioned about his commitment to high-speed rail, the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change recently said that the Scottish and Westminster Governments</p><p class=\"indent\">\"are starting to engage in parallel.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee</em>, 16 December 2008; c 1206.]</p><p>As the minister knows, parallel lines do not meet.</p><p>The minister's enthusiasm for rail is well known, but we need him to roll up his sleeves. As we say in the north-east, we need him to get yokit on the issue. Rivalries with Westminster need to be set aside. Real and sustained dialogue is required if Scotland is not to be shunted into a siding for many years. Edinburgh and Glasgow must be included in the blueprint from the outset. I look for a pledge on that from the Scottish and UK Governments.</p><p>When the American vice president last week announced plans to invest in high-speed rail, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is a giant environmental down payment.\"</p><p>Can Britain match that?

Who does not like a cut in tax? However, as my colleague Jeremy Purvis said, the tax freeze locks in the unfairness of the discredited council tax for another year. The council tax freeze was supposed to be a temporary measure, easing difficulties while a fairer local income tax system was developed. In that light, we did not oppose it. In the same way, it has been tholed by councils across the country on the understanding that it heralded a major reform of how local services are funded. However, of course, that is no longer the case. The situation changed when the Government announced that it would not take forward any such reform in the current session of Parliament.</p><p>With the LIT having been ruled out for this session, it is unlikely that change will happen within the next five years even if there is a majority for reform in the next session of Parliament. I am concerned that that is a missed opportunity to strengthen the role of local government. Councils should be responsible for raising a significant proportion of funds locally&#8212;we can argue about what that level should be&#8212;and they deserve to have that autonomy. We have been happy to lobby for fiscal autonomy for our Parliament, but I hear less about applying the same principle to local government.</p><p>Rather than an increase in the share of funds that is raised locally and, importantly, accounted for locally, we are seeing the erosion of the principle of locally elected people being responsible for local services. Local government is in danger of morphing into local administration these days. John Swinney has said that he wants a new, equal relationship with local government, yet he has in effect removed local discretion to raise additional revenue for locally needed services. That is not my idea of a new relationship.<place-holder colnum=\"16154\"/></p><p>In a similar debate last year, I said that a council tax freeze must be fully funded by central Government and must not impact on other budgets for local government services in the current year or in future years. We now face the real prospect that the on-going council tax freeze will adversely impact council services in coming years. The Government has made a commitment to freeze the tax until 2011, but at what cost to local services? Is the tax to be frozen for all time? If not, what kind of hike in council tax will be needed all at once? A massive increase will be required just to provide the same level of funding for local authorities. Perpetually freezing council tax helps no one. It is irresponsible to do that without demonstrating that there is an exit strategy, so the Government is piling up trouble for future years. Of course, the SNP is fond of grand gestures&#8212;leaving the pieces to be picked up by the next Government&#8212;but it has dug itself into a big hole with the council tax freeze.</p><p>Liberal Democrats believe in strengthening local government. Devolution should not stop here at Holyrood. The SNP's increasing tendency to exert control over spending contrasts with its assertion that it is giving more control to local government. Although the move to single outcome agreements has some merit, the demands of the concordat coupled with the council tax freeze mean that councils have less control over their spending than ever before. Indeed, there is a good deal more confusion, which makes the need for a review of the distribution formula more pressing.</p><p>I thank John Swinney for insisting, in the face of worrying resistance from COSLA, that the distribution formula will be reviewed, but I continue to press for an interim solution to help the five councils that currently receive less than 90 per cent of the Scottish average. When I proposed that such councils should be protected through a top-up fund, John Swinney responded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the current distribution formula&#8212;whatever we might think of it&#8212;is broadly accepted by all elements of local government\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, 11 February 2009; c 14934.]</p><p>I disagree. The current distribution formula is accepted by the majority of councils, which have a vested interest in resisting change. Since local government reorganisation, the funding system has contained an in-built unfairness that the majority has been unwilling to address. As a minority Government, the SNP should have some sympathy with the difficulties that a minority can face in bringing about change.</p><p>I will not hide the fact that I campaigned for such a review when my party was in government&#8212;I like to be consistent&#8212;or that, to its credit, the Executive had started to tackle the issue. However, the freeing up of ring fencing has reversed that trend, with the result that five <place-holder colnum=\"16155\"/> councils have been pulled even further below the Scottish average. I believe that that was an unintentional consequence. It is to John Swinney's credit that he is pushing COSLA to consider the distribution formula&#8212;COSLA does not want to do that&#8212;but I ask him to go one step further. To ease the problems facing Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council and the others, he should put in place an interim measure to introduce a safety net that stops councils receiving less than 90 per cent of the Scottish average.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14894372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I recognise that, in the current economic climate, many people will welcome a council tax freeze.

The discussion that we had supported Greenfield's analysis that a significant issue for women researchers was that,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in the critical period of their early 30s, just as they had gained their scientific credibility, and were amassing data and the ensuing all-important published papers that impress the university search committees, so there was the shadow of the biological time-bomb for women.</p><p class=\"indent\">If a woman takes time out to have a child at this highly critical phase in her career, it could be very hard for her to compete on a level playing field with men who have had a consistent track record of publishing.\"</p><p>In universities at postdoctoral research level&#8212;where some of our best bright young women scientists should be working&#8212;short-term research grants, the constant moving around that is required and the inflexibility of conditions of research awards are all unintentional barriers to participation. We need to move away from assessing somebody's competence purely by the number of papers that they have published. There should be more recognition of soft skills and teaching skills. Improved mentoring is urgently required and support for returners would also help.</p><p>Although there are role models for young women to look to&#8212;Baroness Susan Greenfield, Dame Professor Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Professor Neva Haites and Professor Anne Glover to name a few&#8212;the reality is that there are few women in senior posts in science departments to set an example to them. There is no magic solution, but a consistent and pragmatic approach is needed to nurture young women scientists. The UK resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology, which is based at Napier University, is tackling some of the issues, but much more needs to be done. The Athena project aims to increase the number of women who are recruited to the top academic posts in science. It works with universities on staff development, mentoring and networking schemes. It is extremely disheartening to me that only three Scottish universities have shown any interest in the project and I urge all Scottish universities to sign up to it.</p><p>A complex web of interactions has a negative impact on the retention and advancement of women within the sector as a whole. To reduce attrition at all levels of scientific, engineering and technology-related employment, workplace policies, practices and whole cultures need to change to make workplaces fair places to work for everyone. We need workplaces in which it is acknowledged that family life is at least as important as working life and in which every <place-holder colnum=\"16048\"/> individual can progress to attain their full potential and reach the top if they have the capacity to do so.</p><p>We should be under no illusion: this is not a women's problem but a problem for us all. Britain's future depends on finding or creating far more professionals in science, engineering and technology and keeping them in work. The Confederation of British Industry has said that, to maintain the UK as a competitor in the global economy and keep manufacturing companies in Britain, the number of graduates in science, engineering and technology will have to double by 2012. Where will the new recruits be found if not through greater participation by women?</p><p>The Government's science strategy highlights the need to strengthen Scotland's capacity for innovation. With a wider variety of people working on new products or projects, we would surely be more likely to find new ideas and different approaches. Common sense tells us that a diverse work force&#8212;including one that is gender diverse&#8212;results in greater innovation.</p><p>If each sector and influencer agreed to take responsibility for improving equality practices within the area over which they have influence or control, the barriers to women's participation, retention and progression could be minimised. The Scottish Parliament and the Government are key influencers. We must encourage fresh thinking to tackle the inequalities that are leading to disillusionment among young women scientists. I hope that everyone will be able to support my amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14859432", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Question Time &#8212; Scottish Executive &#8212; Health and Wellbeing: \"Science for Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The number of women who are employed in science, engineering and technology is half the number of men who are employed in the same industries.

The framework will be judged to be successful if it brings about change in communities throughout Scotland, protects and enhances the quality of the natural and built environments and helps to build safer, stronger and healthier communities.</p><p>When people think about planning, they focus too often on the local, tangible parts of it and miss the bigger picture. For me, the bigger picture is the role that inspirational planning can play in creating a healthier and happier society. I expect much of today's debate to focus on infrastructure, but we should not forget the importance of place making or designing with nature. We can learn much from <place-holder colnum=\"15536\"/> the past. For example, we can look to Patrick Geddes, the garden cities movement or the great social reformers who knew how the environment impacted on the health of our communities.</p><p>Today, our communities face many threats that planning could help to address. Harry Burns, Scotland's chief medical officer, has pointed out that the health benefits of good planning are often not taken into account because they are difficult to quantify. Those benefits can include personal fitness, good mental health and shorter hospital stays&#8212;a range of benefits that would save society money in service costs, sickness benefits and the like, as well as create a happier community.</p><p>There might not be disease from poor sanitation and overcrowding these days, but what about our epidemics of heart disease, obesity and alcohol abuse or the growth of asthma? What can the planning system do to tackle those things? It can do a great deal more than it has done to date, and I hope that NPF 2 will encourage a greater focus on the spaces that we create, the quality of the built environment and the links to the natural environment.</p><p>I turn to the detail of NPF 2. It is commendable that the Government has not succumbed to pressure to identify scores of national projects&#8212;subsidiarity is important in planning, and it would be entirely wrong to develop a heavy-handed, top-down approach&#8212;but I would have been happier if there had been a clearer process for consultation on the selection of national projects. Six of the 14 recommendations of the lead committee relate to consultation and engagement.</p><p>Improving the level and quality of public participation in planning has been one theme of the planning modernisation process. Reconciling development and local sensitivities is always difficult, but a much greater role for community involvement in the planning process is key to the reforms that have been working their way through the system for some time.</p><p>Greater community engagement earlier in the planning cycle requires much greater public awareness of why planning matters, but it also requires standards to be set to ensure that the quality of engagement in the planning system can command trust and commitment. The shortcoming that the committees identified must not be repeated. I urge the Government to accept that and to make a commitment that any future iterations of the framework will involve meaningful engagement.</p><p>As the document represents the Government's vision for Scotland's development to 2030, it is legitimate to ask how it helps to deliver other policy imperatives, such as a reduction in carbon emissions. It is also pertinent to check whether the <place-holder colnum=\"15537\"/> investment plan and the STPR are in step and will make the vision a reality. Some witnesses told our committee that there was an inherent tension between the development objectives in NPF 2 and its climate change objectives. The Sustainable Development Commission said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our particular concern is that the document will lock us into a higher carbon future, which will mean that in other aspects of policy we will have to make even more radical cuts in emissions\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee</em>, 6 January 2009; c 1222.]</p><p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency suggested that a step change in policy would be required and said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it would be desirable to see Government at least aspire to stabilise road traffic growth as a complementary measure to support land based transport emission reductions via improved accessibility and modal shift.\"</p><p>Sustrans and Transport Scotland drew attention to the framework's deficiencies on cycling and walking, which Des McNulty pointed out. Safe and attractive walking and cycling routes ought to be an integral part of all development proposals; the framework should recognise that and give clear guidance to local authorities to develop active travel strategies in local plans. High-speed rail, on which the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee has just concluded an inquiry, must be a higher priority, too. I support Des McNulty's amendment, which addresses those two points.</p><p>The public transportation elements of the new Forth crossing are of fundamental importance, and I agree that NPF 2 should make specific reference to the multimodal corridor.</p><p>I turn to the energy proposals. The use of the phrase \"carbon capture ready\" is meaningless and could allow the construction of new, unabated coal-fired power stations, which would add significantly to carbon dioxide emissions.

Local government should have sufficient autonomy and resources to be free to respond to local needs while recognising that it has a key role in helping to address urgent national agendas. A tension between those aspects always exists, but achieving the right balance is important for our communities.</p><p>Have the changes that the SNP introduced, such as the concordat, the removal of ring fencing, shifts in budgets, the council tax freeze and single outcome agreements, lived up to the hype? Are we in a new era of respect for local councils? Can councils get on and do what is needed for their communities? I do not think so. On the one hand, councils must provide adequately for needs-led local services such as home care and special educational needs support and, on the other hand, councils are still being pushed to deliver uncosted and unrealistic SNP election pledges. That all takes place in the face of what has become a council tax freeze of indefinite duration. The SNP's retreat today on local income tax is another muddle.</p><p>More than 40 specific grants disappeared last year. The removal of ring fencing was intended to make council budgeting more flexible, but we know that it made budgeting harder for some voluntary bodies. As Jeremy Purvis said, it also created problems in waste management and flood prevention.</p><p>There has been a deal of confusion about what is and is not in the concordat. Councils have waited for almost two years with growing frustration for clarity about the Scottish Futures Trust. Meanwhile, school buildings and swimming pools continue to deteriorate; year groups progress through schools; and communities wonder when the Government will help councils to tackle some of the big capital headaches. Prudential borrowing and small increments in capital allocations are insufficient. Councils were insulted by the constant reiteration by the former Minister for Schools and Skills that they had extra capital and that they should just get on and build schools. I am therefore delighted that, as Jeremy Purvis said, the Liberal Democrats challenged that and secured continuing annual revenue support for school building.</p><p>As Helen Eadie said, like businesses and households, councils have faced particular pressures in the past year because of rising fuel costs. Those pressures were compounded by reducing revenues from planning fees and land sales.<place-holder colnum=\"14926\"/></p><p>Several north-east members have pointed out the problems that the grant allocation system presents for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, and Nicol Stephen made an impassioned plea on Aberdeen's behalf. I have supported the fair share campaign since its outset. The previous Administration started&#8212;albeit painfully slowly&#8212;to turn around the situation and the two north-east councils were edging towards receiving a fairer share of the Scottish budget. Sadly, that position was reversed last year, when Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council received the worst settlements that they have ever had, which represented 85 per cent and 88 per cent of the Scottish average. That is grossly unfair. The fair share campaign asks for three things: opening of the grant distribution debate at COSLA and Scottish Government level; introduction of a floor for aggregate external finance per head of population; and simplification of grant distribution and allocation under grant-aided expenditure. The debate has started. As Mr Swinney said, a COSLA working group has been set up, but I am concerned about the pace of its work. I would like to see a concerted effort to tackle the unfairness in the current system. It cannot be right that last year Aberdeenshire received 13.4 per cent less than the Scottish average&#8212;such variation is too great.</p><p>The drop in share is a consequence&#8212;perhaps unintended&#8212;of the removal of ring fencing. If we look at previously ring-fenced funding, last year Aberdeenshire received 41.5 per cent less than the Scottish average.

I use those examples because they were given high priority by people who are now Government ministers.</p><p>We are becoming used to the SNP's broken promises, but worse, in this context, Government ministers continue to suggest that certain transport projects will happen, even though the review that ministers signed off in Cabinet and presented to the Parliament excludes those projects.

The answer is obvious: Mr Lochhead's recent actions have brought the Elgin bypass to the fore. As an Opposition MSP, my role is to hold ministers to account. If Mr Brownlee does not think that a lack of credibility is a serious issue, that is a matter for him. The behaviour in which Mr Lochhead has indulged recently not only disappoints his electorate but contributes to many people's disenchantment with politics. He cannot sit in Parliament and support the outcome of the STPR, then go home to his constituency and say that he is disappointed in it. Mind you, he is probably not as disappointed as the people of Elgin are with their MSP.</p><p>Richard Lochhead says that he will keep making the case.

Everyone expects a great deal from their local council, even when it does not get a great deal from the Government, which supplies the majority of councils' funds.</p><p>Since the council tax freeze last year, councils have been even more reliant on central <place-holder colnum=\"13404\"/> Government grants. The concordat that the Government hailed last year as a new deal for local government has not lived up to expectations. The concordat and its companion, the single outcome agreement, have not led to a new dawn for councils. As Jeremy Purvis said, councils collectively find themselves tied in to 3,599 outcomes and indicators, they have less and less autonomy, but they take the flak for the lack of investment in local services.</p><p>Brian Adam said that the concordat is about respect. Well, I do not see evidence of a Government that respects local government; I see a Government that shrugs off concerns at every turn with nothing more than an offhand assurance that it gave councils the resources and that it is up to them what they do. As Mr McLetchie said, that is a cruel distortion of reality.</p><p>So what does the settlement that has been announced today do to help councils respond to the economic downturn? What does it mean for teachers and pupils who are waiting for new school buildings? What does it do to help young couples who are struggling to find a home? Well, the truth is that it will do less than we had hoped. As Jeremy Purvis pointed out, a 1 per cent change is not enough. Councils have been hit with rising energy costs, lower than expected income and extra responsibilities, which means that front-line services are being squeezed.</p><p>Councils are crying out for support for capital investment in schools, as we have heard. The muddle that is the Scottish Futures Trust means that they will have another year of delay and uncertainty and that communities will not see much-needed new schools. Audit Scotland told us earlier this year that the investment required for the school estate is in the order of &#163;5 billion, excluding maintenance and repair. Local councils cannot fund all that out of their capital allocations. There must be level-playing-field support from the Government.</p><p>The Government has made much of its funding package to accelerate the building of affordable housing, but the money has been clawed back from all local councils, although not all councils will be able to draw on the central fund. That is unfair. Like Sarah Boyack, I am concerned that some local authorities&#8212;for example, Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council and the City of Edinburgh Council&#8212;have been informed that they will not be eligible for funding, even though they contributed to the money from COSLA. I understand that the Government has decided not to fund housing in those authorities because it claims that funding for affordable housing this year had not been dramatically cut while other councils had their cash reduced, but that claim does not hold water&#8212;data from SPICe show that <place-holder colnum=\"13405\"/> Aberdeenshire Council, for example, received a massive cut for affordable housing in 2008-09 but is still not eligible for accelerated funding this year.</p><p>Why are ministers denying funding for housing in some of the country's areas of most pressing need? Edinburgh has the most acute housing shortage in the country, yet City of Edinburgh Council has been given only the weak assurance that it will be considered for the next tranche of front-loaded investment. Investment is needed now to safeguard jobs. Housing associations and councils should be invited to bid for a share of the money now to drive forward their affordable homes programmes. Councils in such areas have well-developed plans for affordable housing that could be implemented quickly. Why are they being cut out? Will the minister give an explanation in his summing up?</p><p>As Nicol Stephen outlined, the current distribution formula contains too many anomalies that hurt north-east councils. As has been pointed out, Aberdeen City Council receives 80 per cent of the Scottish average per head of population. For me, that variance is far too great. Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council do not seek to do better than other areas&#8212;some of which, admittedly, have many more problems of deprivation and need&#8212;but simply aim to receive a fairer share of the public funds that are available nationally.</p><p>Simply asserting that the Government has provided a good settlement is not sufficient. Many speakers this afternoon&#8212;including Jackie Baillie, Nicol Stephen and Hugh Henry&#8212;and the evidence contradict that assertion. Councils are struggling to meet the needs of their communities. I hope that, when they reflect on the points that have been made in this afternoon's debate as they finalise the budget, ministers will respond in a way that ensures that all our councils are equipped to deal with the very real pressures that they face.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14303137", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance Settlement 2009-10"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is no doubt that local government provides some of the most important and valued services in our communities.

The number of young people who are killed or seriously injured on our roads is shocking. The stark accident statistics, of course, hide the real and lasting impact that such a loss has on family and friends.</p><p>The overall rates of accidents are coming down, with the number of road deaths in Britain below 3,000 in 2007, making our roads among the safest in the world. However, that success is overshadowed by the fact that young drivers are not getting any safer. Road crashes are the single biggest killer of 15 to 24-year-olds in industrial countries. In 2006, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the high crash fatality and injury rates of young, male novice drivers represent a major public health issue.\"</p><p>The research that was done by Jean Hopkin for the Institute of Advanced Motorists is comprehensive and makes a significant contribution to our knowledge of where and when young drivers are unsafe. She analysed almost 250,000 crashes in which people were killed or seriously injured between 2000 and 2006. Her work is published in the report \"Safe drivers are made, not born\", which contains practical recommendations for local authorities and Government to implement. There is a 10-point package of actions to make younger drivers safer, which includes practical and effective steps that <place-holder colnum=\"13176\"/> could be taken now to reduce the number of fatalities.</p><p>The debate is set against the background of Department for Transport proposals to make changes to the driving test. The consultation has closed and we expect to see the Westminster Government's proposals in the spring. We also await the publication of the Scottish Government's road safety strategy. The consultation on that closed in April, with a stated intention that the final document would be published in the autumn. However, we are still waiting for it. Perhaps in responding to the debate, the minister will advise us when that will be published.</p><p>I am sure that the Governments here and in Westminster are actively considering road safety, but we can afford to wait no longer. Recommendations in the Institute of Advanced Motorists action plan can be implemented now by the Scottish Government and I hope that there is cross-party agreement that that should happen.</p><p>For example, the institute suggests encouraging more understanding of driving in a wider range of road conditions in which novice drivers are most at risk, such as driving at night, in poor visibility and on rural roads. It suggests that we prepare learner drivers better for driving solo or with passengers by making them more aware of where and when they are likely to crash. The institute recommends integrating road safety education into the core school curriculum subjects so that young people develop a self-taught awareness of the risks and responsibilities of using roads as drivers, riders and passengers. It also recommends that we guide parents and carers to help children to become safer drivers through additional supervised driving practice in the family car.</p><p>I will focus on where young people are likely to crash; I am sure that other members will pick up on other recommendations in the report. The message that young drivers are at particular risk when driving on rural roads has come through loud and clear not only from the research but&#8212;sadly&#8212;from the coverage in my daily newspaper, <em>The Press and Journal</em>, which I commend for its campaigning stance on road safety. It has in the past convened a road safety summit and most recently offered a young driver of the year award.</p><p>The research found that young drivers</p><p class=\"indent\">\"tend to over-estimate their driving ability and under-estimate the demands of the driving task, driving too close to the point where they are likely to lose control of the vehicle\".</p><p>I note that that trait is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"far less prevalent in young women drivers\".</p><p>On rural roads, the most common accident to involve young males is a single-vehicle crash in <place-holder colnum=\"13177\"/> which the car leaves the road. More than a third of young drivers in killed or serious injury crashes skid or overturn. The research suggests that speed, judgment and poor vehicle control skills are particular issues. That is not surprising when we consider that most people learn to drive in towns and cities. Little, if any, time is spent on rural roads, yet we know that rural driving is some of the most demanding driving, especially when it is coupled with other hazards, such as bad weather or poor visibility.</p><p>In the light of those findings, we urgently need to direct our efforts to working with young male novice drivers to increase their understanding and experience of rural road driving. Of course, good examples of road safety initiatives exist throughout the country. In my region, Aberdeenshire Council supports the pass plus young drivers scheme by contributing a &#163;45 grant, and a further &#163;100 contribution to the cost is available from community safety groups. The uptake of those grants has been quite good.</p><p>Grampian Police runs its driving ambition scheme for sixth-year pupils in all Aberdeenshire schools and holds weekend events for those who leave school before sixth year. The community safety campaign safe drive stay alive is delivered throughout Grampian and reaches about 5,000 fifth-year pupils every year. Those events are open to college students and to any youngsters who leave school before fifth year.</p><p>I would like those local initiatives to be backed by a concerted and sustained national effort. I stress that I do not wish to demonise young drivers. I agree with Ms Hopkin's conclusion that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"While young drivers are a high risk group in themselves, most young drivers are not deliberately unsafe\".</p><p>That is precisely why driver training and more driving practice before solo driving are really important. We let down our young people by not ensuring that they are equipped to deal with the demands of rural driving. Preparing our young people to be safer drivers must be our number 1 road safety priority. It would be a great investment. I would like the Government to work closely with schools, young people, their parents and carers, local authorities and driving instructors to develop a programme of continuing driver education.

According to the infrastructure investment plan, the new Forth crossing is the Government's number 1 national development, yet no money has been confirmed to pay for it.

It is not good enough for the SNP to avoid answering such questions; it is time to stop hiding and give a straight answer. Where will the &#163;4 billion come from?

Unfortunately, confusion and delay continue to be the hallmarks of the Government's approach. Nothing that we have heard today will allay the fears of communities throughout Scotland. The situation must be rectified urgently if Scotland is not to be plunged further than necessary into recession. The Government undervalues what infrastructure investment delivers. Among other things, it connects Scotland to markets; ensures that children learn in modern facilities and that our hospitals are fit for purpose; and has a role in securing thousands of jobs.

Responses to the SFT consultation from key stakeholders have been utterly disparaging of the draft proposals.

That is quite a list of shortcomings.</p><p>In a mature democracy, it is hard enough to encourage participation in elections without the muddle that we encountered last year. The <place-holder colnum=\"11643\"/> Scotland Office has a lot to answer for. Organising the Scottish Parliament elections is one of the few significant tasks that the generously resourced Scotland Office has had to do in the past few years, yet most of the failures that the Gould report highlighted fell within its remit.</p><p>Many shortcomings related to the parliamentary elections and less light has been cast on the comparative success of the local elections; I think that it is worth reflecting on that for a moment. The intuitive STV system, which was quickly understood and appreciated by the electorate, has delivered fairer votes; there has been a quiet revolution in our council chambers across Scotland. Scotland now has councils that much better reflect the spread of views among their electorates. No longer are councils so dominated by a particular party group that opposition is rendered ineffective; more parties are working together to provide good local governance; and more of the electorate have found that people whom they voted for have become councillors. STV has given voters a much wider choice: the average number of candidates per ward rose from 3.4 in 2003 to 7.4 in 2007. In 2007, there were no uncontested seats, whereas 61 councillors were returned unopposed in 2003.</p><p>A high percentage of voters ended up with the councillors for whom they had voted. In 2003, about half of all voters voted for losing candidates, but in 2007, nearly three quarters found that the candidate to whom they had given their first preference had been successful. STV succeeded in broadening the range of choice for Scottish voters and opening up the electoral process to a greater range of candidates. We saw an increase in the number of young people on Scotland's councils. As the system matures, I hope that all parties will take the opportunity to field as diverse a range of candidates as possible.

They allow islanders to go about their daily life, whether that means going to school or work, accessing health or leisure services, welcoming tourists on to the islands or exporting valuable goods off them. Ferries ensure the viability of the islands and enhance the economic and social fabric of island life.</p><p>In its evidence, the Scottish Crofting Foundation said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"affordable reliable ferry services are probably the single most important factor in maintaining functioning economies and viable populations in the islands of Scotland.\"</p><p>It is clear to me that improving the reliability and responsiveness of ferries will be key to encouraging young people and families in particular to stay on or come to the islands.</p><p>There were many messages from the inquiry. We have heard some of them already, but they bear repetition. We heard about poor, unresponsive services and ageing vessels. We heard about the difficulties of winter sailings and the impacts of cancelled services, such as hospital appointments being missed, people incurring the expense of a hotel on the mainland or children not getting home from school for the weekend. All <place-holder colnum=\"10627\"/> those things had significant impacts on people's daily lives.</p><p>When I visited Mallaig informally with Charlie Gordon, we heard that the timetable for services to the small isles was such that stays of an additional one or two days were often necessary in order to meet routine appointments, such as hospital appointments, on the mainland. The length of stay on the mainland could of course be even longer if poor weather meant that sailings were cancelled. All that incurs not just financial costs but social and emotional costs, which impact on family life.</p><p>The committee also heard about poor customer service, although I note that there were telling differences between CalMac and NorthLink Ferries, with NorthLink being much more responsive to customers.</p><p>Another common theme that emerged was the need for timetables to allow island residents to commute to the mainland for work. There was an overwhelming sense that ferry timetables are designed to suit operators rather than users. Relatively simple adjustments to timetables could make a big difference. The Government must tackle that. It needs to give local communities a clear role in suggesting improvements and changes and it must respond quickly and positively. I welcome what the minister said about the small adjustments to timetables that have been made.</p><p>As others have already said, there is a real disconnect between different modes of transport. I think that everyone who gave evidence to us mentioned the lack of integration between ferries and other modes of transport. Many gave examples of poor connections and missed opportunities to make travelling easier.</p><p>Although I appreciate the complexity of timetabling for ferries and trains in particular, I urge the Government to accept our recommendation that it should establish a group, under the auspices of Transport Scotland, to ensure that operators of all transport modes meet one another regularly to discuss how integration can be improved.</p><p>I was particularly concerned to learn of the lack of investment in port infrastructure&#8212;and the lack of foresight in that regard. Much more priority must be given to upgrading terminals.</p><p>I draw particular attention to the submission from ZetTrans and Shetland Islands Council on the need for capital investment in interisland routes. It is vital that the Government recognises the need to support local authorities in maintaining port and ferry services.</p><p>I could not speak in this debate without mentioning RET. We heard a range of views about <place-holder colnum=\"10628\"/> RET. As Des McNulty said, it was welcomed by the communities that were involved in the pilot. I do not underestimate the economic challenges that the Western Isles face. However, the committee detected a real sense of disgruntlement from other island communities that were excluded from the pilot. Reducing ferry fares to help island economies is the right approach, but the pilot is expected to last for three years and targets only one Scottish island group. That is blatant discrimination; it is not a pilot scheme. It is perceived as nothing more than an electoral bribe. The SNP Government is, in essence, operating a permanent scheme in one part of Scotland but not in the other equally deserving island groups.</p><p>During the inquiry we heard a range of views on increasing competition and on breaking up CalMac. We have already heard a lot from Mr Johnstone on that issue. Ferry services are lifelines to some of the most remote communities in Scotland. Public subsidies were introduced, quite rightly, to protect routes that would not otherwise be commercially viable. The Scottish Government must not break up CalMac's monopoly if it would jeopardise those links. Already fragile communities must not be subjected to further uncertainty. At the risk of stating the obvious, ferries are not buses&#8212;there are not lots of ferry owners waiting in the wings to step in if something goes wrong.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the Government has now embarked on a full review. The minister has indicated some of the things that he would like to take on board. I hope that he will tackle the short-term issues that we identified, such as adjusting timetables; improving communication and co-ordination; promoting more effective consultation; and improving accessibility. In the review, the Government needs to focus on what best serves today's and tomorrow's communities.</p><p>A number of respondents remarked that ferry services are the same as they were 30 years ago and referred to:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"routes, timetables, vessels all fixed, providing an out of date service for a set of circumstances which have not prevailed for a number of years.\"</p><p>That needs to change.</p><p>To secure the long-term future of a ferry network that is fit for purpose in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the Government should examine innovative proposals such as faster and more fuel-efficient vessels; significantly improved timetables; new routes and the use of fixed links; replacing and upgrading ferry vessels and port infrastructure; and making it easier for ferry operators to change services within their contracts, if those changes are designed to promote improvements and facilitate innovation.<place-holder colnum=\"10629\"/></p><p>There is a reasonable time before the contract ends&#8212;let us ensure that that time is put to good use.

We must work together in Parliament to ensure that the bill is fit for purpose. This morning, the First Minister made only one commitment relating to the bill, in reaffirming his target of reducing emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. The recent consultation drew a remarkable 21,000 responses from all around the world. I have heard it said before that Scotland's impact is small and insignificant in this global matter, but surely that level of international response demonstrates that people are waiting to see what we do and are urging us to grasp the opportunity to make a profound difference. I hope that we do not let them down.</p><p>While acknowledging the moral imperative to act on the issue, we should also recognise the economic opportunities for Scotland in moving to a low-carbon economy. A strong bill that has the backing of the whole Parliament will give business the certainty that it needs for it to invest in order to put us at the forefront of a new low-carbon global economy. The virtue of annual targets and steady progressive policies is that they give advance warning to the market of the scale of the task and provide a spur to specific innovation.</p><p>I want the Government to ensure that the eventual legislation includes these key issues: maintaining the 80 per cent emissions reduction target; insisting on annual targets; measuring the whole basket of greenhouse gases; and providing strong incentives and sanctions for public bodies to ensure that all the measures work. All emissions must be accounted for in the targets that are set out in the climate change bill. The exclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions from those targets would mean that a significant and growing percentage of emissions were going uncounted. The bill must also ensure that the Government of the day is held to account through scrutiny of forward plans as well as through proper reporting back.<place-holder colnum=\"10396\"/></p><p>There has been a range of comments about budgeting periods, but there is one clear message from scientists: we need emissions reductions of at least 3 per cent per year to keep on target. Without annual targets, there will inevitably be a drift, and the longer we leave it, the more punitive will be the measures that will have to be imposed. Friends of the Earth recently said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There are two ways society can get a grip on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The best approach is to make a steady, achievable cut every year. The alternative is to wait until we have no choice but to do something, and then make drastic cuts&#8212;which may turn out to be too little, too late. It's like choosing a gentle path down the cliff or going over the void.\"</p><p>The SNP has argued that it is not practical to have annual targets, and it cites the lag of 20 months before greenhouse gas inventories are available, but is the real reason why the Government has backtracked on annual targets not more prosaic? Annual targets will be uncomfortable for the Government&#8212;they would be for any Government&#8212;which will from the outset be held to account here in Parliament. Grand gestures about an 80 per cent emissions reduction by 2050 need to be underpinned by real action.</p><p>I believe that it is possible to speed up the data collection process. Currently, provisional estimates are available after only three months. If it is to be taken seriously, the Government must commission research now to identify and remove the barriers to shorter reporting times for the various inventories. Giving evidence to Westminster's Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last year, Dr Alice Bows from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research explained:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I would say that the likelihood is that if you wanted to make that quicker, I am sure that that would be possible because we have not actually been doing it for that long ... If people were more used to collecting emissions data on a monthly basis and submitting them more rapidly, then you could speed up that process.\"</p><p>Support should be given for more research into the sociological aspects of climate change. So far, technology has received far more research attention than have socioeconomic, cultural and political factors, and energy supply far more than energy demand.</p><p>I recently attended the Macaulay Institute's open day and was interested to hear from a social scientist about a new project that is examining behavioural change in relation to climate change. It is increasingly clear that, although technological innovation can reduce the energy requirement for specific activities and make low-carbon energy sources economically and environmentally viable, the impact on reducing carbon-intensive energy use will, critically, depend on broad public and political commitment to such a reduction. <place-holder colnum=\"10397\"/></p><p>Otherwise, increases in energy efficiency could simply raise demand for energy-intensive products and services.</p><p>Much of what needs to be done to tackle climate change does not need legislation, so I am disappointed that valuable time has been squandered over the past year. Opportunities have been missed, particularly in relation to renewable energy and energy efficiency. Achim Steiner, the United Nations under-secretary-general and the executive director of the UN Environment Programme, has said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Energy efficiency, along with cleaner and renewable forms of energy generation, is one of the pillars upon which a de-carbonized world will stand or fall. The savings that can be made right now are potentially huge and the costs to implement them relatively low if sufficient numbers of governments, industries, businesses and consumers act\".</p><p>The potential for de-carbonising modern economies is huge. Energy efficiency measures can be taken and wind, solar and hydro power are carbon-free energy alternatives that are available today, but there is a lack of clarity about the Government's overall direction on renewables, which must be addressed. After 15 months in power, why does the Government have no energy strategy? Will the Government introduce policies immediately to tackle energy efficiency issues in the existing housing stock in a sustained way? When will there be a new biomass support scheme?</p><p>The Government has announced 15 bills today. I have no doubt that the one that could make the greatest difference is the proposed climate change bill. The response to the consultation on the proposed bill gives the Government a clear mandate to be bold. It identifies that, although everyone in Scotland must play their part in tackling climate change, we need leadership, direction, clarity and certainty on the way forward.</p><p>The First Minister said this morning that the legislative programme on climate change and the environment will propel his Government into a new leadership role, but that that is a role in which he will be comfortable. I do not particularly care whether Mr Salmond is comfortable but, on the climate change issues, I would like him to be bold and to show leadership.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wish to use my time to talk about the proposed climate change bill.

Indeed, just nine pages out of 85 in the consultation deal with supporting measures. Setting an emissions target is important, but taking action that will allow that target to be met is where the real work lies, and that work should have started already. The climate change bill must be robust enough to result in specific actions across government, industry, and organisations, and to encourage individuals.</p><p>While the SNP has dithered over its plans, the Liberal Democrats have taken the lead. In Opposition at Westminster, we set out comprehensive policies on climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as specific measures that will work towards our goal of making the United Kingdom carbon neutral by 2050. In the previous Administration at Holyrood, we led the way by investing more in renewable energy and support for energy efficiency measures than in any other part of Britain, and by ensuring that Scotland's first target on renewables generation was met three years ahead of schedule. Such strategies have seen the Liberal Democrats praised by environmental groups as the greenest of the main parties.</p><p>Given that the SNP's actions are falling so short, perhaps it is worth asking if it is getting the framework right. Unfortunately, the answer is again no. I welcome the fact that the Government has set an ambitious long-term target of an 80 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050. That was a positive move but, as so often seems to be the case, the SNP's commitment goes only so far. By going back on its pre-election pledge to introduce binding annual targets, it has demonstrated that it <place-holder colnum=\"9032\"/> is willing to put political coverage ahead of achieving reductions.</p><p>It is not just the Liberal Democrats who see the necessity for annual targets. We have been listening to consultation responses and WWF Scotland says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Climate Change Bill should include statutory targets of at least 3% per year. This is the absolute minimum annual reduction needed to ensure we do not emit more than our fair share of greenhouse gases.\"</p><p>Oxfam and Friends of the Earth Scotland agree with that view.</p><p>By rejecting its own policy of annual targets and instead opting for targets over five-year budget periods, the SNP has set not-in-my-term-of-office targets. Even with annual reporting, five-year budget targets will make it impossible to hold ministers to account for their actions or, indeed, their inaction.</p><p>By contrast, the Liberal Democrats want to increase ministerial accountability.

Although no time should be wasted in taking the shorter-term steps that the review identifies, it is vital that we simultaneously give appropriate attention and thought to the longer-term challenges that Lord Sutherland has laid out. In particular, a compelling case is made for future demand to be reviewed and remodelled regularly so that it can be accurately reflected in future local government finance settlements. A degree of uncertainty is currently associated with the projected costs of the policy, which clearly makes capacity planning difficult. I ask the minister to say in her closing speech how regularly the <place-holder colnum=\"8720\"/> Government intends to review and remodel demand.</p><p>More important still is the last of Lord Sutherland's recommendations, in which he speaks of the need to establish a long-term vision for dealing with the challenge of demographic change. Some members will feel that challenge to be more urgent than others do, but there is undoubtedly a broad consensus on the need for such a vision. Pensions, housing and transport are but a few of the issues that must be considered as part of an integrated and comprehensive approach to changing demography. Will the minister assure me that the Government will seek to involve all interested parties and relevant stakeholders in producing a long-term vision?</p><p>During last week's statement, my colleague Jamie Stone made the point that different parts of Scotland face different demographic pressures and that it is vital that such differences are taken into account as free personal care and its funding are reviewed. Divergences of that kind must also feature in deliberations over how best to respond to the broader questions that are posed by demographic changes in Scotland. Liberal Democrats will ensure that that is the case.</p><p>I thank Help the Aged for its briefing for the debate and will refer to a couple of points that it raises. It is clear that many older people, their carers and their relatives are confused about the policy and what it covers. I agree with Help the Aged that much more needs to be done to ensure that older people have access to clear and transparent information about the policy, the process and their entitlement.

Therefore, it was disappointing to discover the variation in provision of that small but valuable aspect of personal care. Older people should not have to turn to expensive private podiatry services to have their toenails cut, nor is it appropriate for the NHS and councils to wrangle over who is responsible for it. I ask the cabinet secretary to undertake to write to all councils on that matter.</p><p>The review of free personal care by Lord Sutherland provides a clear route forward for building on the benefits and successes of the policy while seeking to ensure that it serves, as fully as possible, the purposes for which it was designed&#8212;purposes that continue to enjoy the support of all members. Nevertheless, that way <place-holder colnum=\"8721\"/> forward must be built on firm financial foundations, which is why I support vigorous efforts to recover funding that is due to Scotland.

I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter and I thank all the members who supported my motion.</p><p>A couple of months ago, I attended a fringe meeting at a party conference. I do not know about other members' experience but, for me, fringe meetings, although undoubtedly enjoyable and informative, do not always spur me to action. However, I left that one determined to do what I could to highlight a problem. I was particularly inspired by George McLaughlin, a young man who spoke at the meeting. George has been blind since birth because of retinopathy. He shared his experiences of being at Uddingston grammar school, which has a special resource unit for pupils with a visual impairment. He was in no doubt about the value of accessible study materials or that they had allowed him to keep up with his sighted peers. He praised his school for the way in which it made his learning inclusive.</p><p>George was followed by a speaker from RNIB Scotland who described an alternative experience. We heard about pupils waiting months for text books to be transcribed into a readable format; students' computers and equipment breaking down and not being replaced for weeks; a lack of absence cover for specialist staff; and young people studying for exams without access to past papers or study aids. I was shocked. As about 80 per cent of our learning is visual, it is not difficult to imagine how disruptive and frustrating it would be to have only limited access to study materials. Through discussions with teachers and specialist support staff, I have learned that an individual's understanding and acceptance of their visual <place-holder colnum=\"8519\"/> impairment is vital to educational progress, as is developing self-image and confidence. However, progress can easily be hindered by a lack of resources, and anything that singles out a pupil as different can undermine their confidence. Good resources minimise the frustration of the impairment.</p><p>In my region, Craigiebarns primary school in Dundee has been praised for its highly inclusive approach to supporting pupils with visual impairment&#8212;I am looking forward to visiting it soon. The school provides a child-led learning experience with a whole-school policy that supports the visually impaired's right to be treated equally. Unfortunately, local authorities in Scotland vary in their approach to and success in producing accessible curriculum materials. In some areas, provision is excellent and of a high standard but, in others, services are not as well developed.</p><p>It is estimated that a pupil will require about 375 educational textbooks in primary school and 750 in secondary school, and that is not counting recreational reading. To transcribe those textbooks is an enormous task for authorities to undertake, which perhaps explains why the picture throughout Scotland is patchy. As a result, in some areas, blind or partially sighted children often have to wait months for materials and, in some cases, the material never arrives. That severely inhibits their ability to learn and further reduces their life opportunities.</p><p>I understand the problems facing local authorities. It can take hours to produce a Braille version of something that might take only 15 minutes to teach. When pupils study for highers, it can take all the time of support staff and more to prepare material for them. Aberdeen City Council, in explaining the matter to me, stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"When the student was taking standard grades the volume of work that had to be adapted and the timescales within which we had to work meant that a significant amount of the work was adapted by the (specialist) teacher in her own time\".</p><p>RNIB's campaign for the establishment of a national transcription service to co-ordinate the provision of learning materials in alternative forms to all blind and partially sighted school pupils offers a cost-effective solution to the problem. A national service would help to address inequalities and provide consistency in the quality, timescales and choice of provision, as well as freeing up teaching time. Most important, it would bring about a step change in those young people's experience of school. For some authorities, the number of blind and partially sighted pupils who require alternative formats is so small that it is not economically viable to provide the service. It would surely be more cost effective and efficient to produce those centrally. If materials are already <place-holder colnum=\"8520\"/> adapted and held electronically, little time or effort is required to provide additional copies, whether they are in Braille, large print or DAISY&#8212;digital accessible information system&#8212;format.</p><p>Ideally, the national transcription service would also hold a stock of equipment for use by blind and partially sighted pupils. In that way, if a child's equipment broke down, a replacement could be available immediately.</p><p>I have written to all four councils in my area, and all of them would welcome a transcription service. I would like to quote a couple of comments. Aberdeen City Council said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Time scales are crucial and work has to be individualised to suit the student. Maths and science work is particularly difficult and time consuming. If there were a bank of materials made available this would considerably reduce workload and stress and free up valuable teacher time which could be spent in the class room.\"</p><p>Aberdeenshire Council commented that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a national transcription service would be supported by our sensory support service as current practice is dependent on networking at meetings and conferences, informal discussions and extensive research by our vision support teachers. As visual impairment is a low incidence disability a national resource would ensure improved curricular access for all blind and partially sighted pupils across Scotland.\"</p><p>Currently, more than 75 per cent of blind and partially sighted adults in Scotland are unemployed. Recent research indicates that almost 1,100 pupils across Scotland are blind or partially sighted, so let us make sure that they do not face the same prospect. The best way to equip young Scots with employment opportunities is through education and skills training. However, the opportunities will be extremely limited for visually impaired Scottish children if they cannot access curriculum materials.</p><p>The right to learn is a principle that is woven into our society. Where there is concern that visually impaired schoolchildren are not getting materials in time, or in the format that they need, Parliament has a duty to examine the issue and offer solutions.</p><p>My solution, and the RNIB's solution, is the establishment of a national educational transcription service. Such a service is overdue. Each year's delay means scores of young people not being able to reach their full potential.</p><p>I hope that tonight's debate will demonstrate cross-party support for taking a fresh look at this problem; I hope, too, that the Minister for Children and Early Years is able to give his support in principle and that he will agree to work with stakeholders to make the service a reality.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13649096", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Right to Read Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is the first time that I have had a motion selected for a members' business debate.

I add my voice to the call for much-needed improvements on the A96 and state my support for a bypass for Elgin.</p><p>Today, the Government published its infrastructure investment plans. However, the only piece of work on the A96 that I could find in the plan is the bypass at Fochabers and Mosstodloch. Residents, businesses and public transport operators along the route will, no doubt, react with disappointment to that news. The minister will say that other schemes are being considered as part of the strategic transport projects review. Although I recognise the need to consider how transport projects fit within the wider context, the fact that the review does not conclude until the summer, at the earliest, leads to uncertainty. Perhaps the minister can give us an assurance that the strategic transport projects review will not be delayed beyond the summer and that the prioritisation of projects will include criteria that ensure that there is a fair geographical spread of investment across Scotland.</p><p>The A96 suffers from low average speeds, poor journey time reliability and, of course, a mix of traffic, including quite a lot of slow-moving agricultural traffic. Road safety is often compromised when drivers become frustrated. I urge the Government to develop a programme of improvements that increases safety at accident black spots, provides unambiguous overtaking opportunities and tackles bottlenecks. Elgin is one of those bottlenecks and is in great need of a bypass. That need is something that it shares with other towns along the A96. Keith, Elgin and Nairn would all gain significantly from such infrastructure investment. My colleague Danny Alexander has campaigned vigorously on Nairn's behalf.</p><p>The Highlands and Islands strategic transport partnership and the north east of Scotland transport partnership jointly commissioned the A96 corridor study, which led to a series of recommendations for all modes of transport. Flowing from that, a further piece of work was commissioned by HITRANS recently to consider road improvements specifically, including bypasses for those three towns. That objective work is now almost complete, and I believe that it <place-holder colnum=\"7529\"/> will give further valuable ammunition to the local campaigns.</p><p>I am disappointed that the regional transport partnerships' role in helping to bridge national and local strategies in a coherent way has been a little undermined. It is not too late for the Government to reconsider the value that it places on RTPs.</p><p>For local residents in towns along the A96, the congestion, pollution and noise are a real headache. Even crossing the road has become a challenge for elderly residents. Further, the congestion also prohibits the opportunity to introduce more sustainable transport modes, such as cycling and walking within the towns. However, the congestion in those towns is not only causing local problems; it is clear that it is beginning to act as a break on the economic growth along the whole corridor. The economy of Elgin is more fragile than any of us would like it to be, and I would like to emphasise that good transport links help to build a stronger economy.</p><p>It is also worth noting that shorter and more reliable journey times can have benefits for the provision and take-up of bus and coach services, particularly long-distance ones.</p><p>I commend the local community, the council and the <em>Northern Scot </em>on their persistence, which I am sure will pay off. These bottlenecks are strategic constraints that need to be addressed sooner rather than later, so I urge the minister to bring forward plans to tackle them.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13401950", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elgin Bypass"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Mary Scanlon for affording us the opportunity to debate this matter this evening.

In fact, the minister said last week that its cost benefit ratio has increased even further.</p><p>The Government's laudable aim of leading the way on tackling climate change must be backed up by action. Transport contributes significantly to climate change, and it is one of the fastest-growing sources of emissions. We can take a big stride forward in respect of carbon reduction by facilitating modal shift, but only if the country invests in high-quality public transport services. If our country is to meet its climate change responsibilities, the Government must deliver a number of key transport projects without delay.</p><p>In developing Scotland's transport network, it is important to break the link between economic growth and transport growth. Reducing carbon emissions without damaging economic performance will be critical in the future, when economic success will depend on attracting and retaining talent. The Borders railway project will facilitate economic growth without concomitant transport growth. The railway will bring significant modal shift benefits. It will reduce car dependence, and it is expected to cut car journeys by more than 700,000 a year, which will reduce emissions and reduce traffic levels on the A7 and the A68. The project will also improve safety for travellers, as <place-holder colnum=\"6895\"/> rail travel is around ten times safer than car travel. Much of the Borders is not currently served by efficient transport links, so the benefits of the railway should not be underestimated. It will facilitate new housing&#8212;including affordable housing&#8212;reduce congestion and address the predicted labour shortfall in the Lothians.</p><p>There is no doubt that the delivery of major transport projects needs broad support from the Government, local councils, the community and the private sector, and long lead-in periods. Successive Governments' certainty and willingness to press on with projects whose genesis was under a different regime are needed. At this stage of the development of the Borders railway project, it is not helpful to introduce uncertainty. Losing time through prevarication is damaging, because people lose confidence and investors think about going elsewhere. In the meantime, the opportunity to take early action to reduce emissions is lost, which makes it harder each year to contain damage. From what we heard last week, I believe that the Borders rail project is losing momentum. It risks stalling completely as a result of a lack of genuine commitment from the Government. We now have no start date and no clear funding mechanism.</p><p>Last week, the minister said that the non-profit distributing vehicle would operate as a private firm under Government control, which raises governance issues.

We should be deeply concerned about the levels of drink-driving throughout the country. In 2005, 30 people were killed and there were 990 casualties from drink-driving related accidents in Scotland. Figures for the four week campaign to tackle drink-driving and drug-driving at Christmas, which was backed by ACPOS, show that 839 drivers were arrested during the period for numerous drink-driving or drug-driving offences throughout the eight police force areas. That figure is unacceptably high and represents only a small reduction from the previous year&#8212;by 69 from 908&#8212;and it demonstrates that there is no room for complacency.</p><p>We know that drink-driving is dangerous and socially unacceptable, but a percentage of men and women continue to ignore the risks that are associated with that dangerous course of action. Although there has been a general downward trend in the number of drink-driving related accidents of all severities, that trend has not been reflected in the number of fatalities, which remains the same as it was 10 years ago.</p><p>Liberal Democrats believe that reducing the drink-driving limit will save lives and we support the British Medical Association's campaign to lower the limit to 50mg. There is clear evidence that such a change will reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries that are caused by drink-driving. Drivers' reaction times and motoring <place-holder colnum=\"6876\"/> skills deteriorate after even a small amount of alcohol. Drinking and driving is a poisonous cocktail. Drinking can give drivers a false sense of confidence, but it impairs their abilities significantly in a number of ways, including slower reaction times, poorer judgment of speed, time and distance, increased thinking and stopping distances, and poorer co-ordination.</p><p>Why has the UK persisted in sticking to a limit that was set in 1965? The system needs to be overhauled. There is much that we can learn from our European neighbours on the matter. Many people confess to being confused about the limit and how it relates to the stronger alcohol that is consumed nowadays. Often, people still think that one unit of alcohol equals one glass, but that is no longer the case. With the trend for much stronger wine, and with wine being sold in larger glasses, one glass can push a person over the limit. With a reduced limit, one pub measure of alcohol is all that would be allowed.</p><p>As people can be affected differently depending on their body weight and when they have eaten, the safest option will always be not to drink and drive. However, replacing the current limit of 80mg with a 50mg limit is a simple and effective step that will be easy for most people to understand. As Mr Thompson said, the 50mg level is the norm in 23 European countries.</p><p>I am concerned by the recent statistics that show that, although women still represent only a small percentage of the overall figures, the number of women who are convicted of drink-driving offences is rising. In the light of that, we need a review of the traditional anti-drink-driving campaigns. Targeted educational campaigns and better labelling on alcohol would also help to reverse that worrying trend.</p><p>Changing the permissible alcohol level is only one part of the story. We also need proper consistent enforcement and prosecution, so adequate police resources should be available to enforce any new limit. Without compromising judicial discretion, we should look to our courts for more consistency in sentencing for drink-driving offences.</p><p>Co-operative working is the key to reducing the drink-driving limit. As the issue is reserved, it is critical that the Administrations at Holyrood and Westminster work together.

It will be cold comfort six or nine months down the line, when councils will be struggling to cope with the demands that are made of them. Councils will be pulled in two opposing directions. On one hand, they will have to make adequate provision for demand-led local services, such as home care <place-holder colnum=\"6036\"/> and special educational needs; on the other, they will have to deliver SNP election pledges that we know were uncosted and unrealistic.</p><p>Accepting funding for a council tax freeze this year will make councils ever more dependent on central Government largesse in following years, because they will have raised an even smaller percentage of their total budget directly from their electorate. Any council tax freeze must be fully funded from central Government, and it must not impact on the other budgets for local government services this year or in future years.</p><p>The funding package that is on offer is conditional on local authorities' agreement to all elements of the concordat.

Perhaps that has been done to hide the fact that there is not enough money to deliver all the things that citizens expect from local government.</p><p>I am not a great fan of ring fencing, but the unseemly haste to do away with it, the lack of real dialogue with local authorities and their partners&#8212;especially those in the third sector&#8212;and the fact that local outcome agreements have not yet been negotiated are causes for concern. More than 40 specific grants have disappeared. The removal of ring fencing might make council budgeting more flexible, but by its nature it will put at risk successful initiatives. Many local community groups have expressed concern to me that budget cuts are looming. We might not find out for some time, but we know that when they happen this Government will refuse to admit the part that it has played.</p><p>I have two specific concerns. First, the settlement has no provision for revenue support or level playing field support to continue the school building programme. What a let down that is for the young people, parents and teachers in my home town of Ellon, which, incidentally, is in Mr Salmond's constituency. Plans for a new academy have been knocked back.</p><p>Councils cannot possibly be expected to take the strain alone when it comes to investing in capital expenditure for schools: they must have support from the Scottish Government. The Scottish National Party must accept that its futures trust model is impractical and possibly illegal, and will almost certainly never take off. The previous Administration got on and built new schools. Unfortunately, confusion and delay are the hallmarks of the Government's approach. What provision is there for new schools in the budget? None whatsoever.<place-holder colnum=\"6037\"/></p><p>Secondly, the hand dealt to regional transport partnerships is particularly poor. The decision to end direct capital funding to RTPs is deeply regrettable. It will, without a doubt, prejudice their ability to deliver quickly and effectively on already agreed objectives.</p><p>At a recent Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee meeting, the cabinet secretary said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the strongest and clearest lesson that I have learned about any major transport or other infrastructure project in the brief time that I have been in government is that governance arrangements have to be crystal clear before a project gets under way. If a project gets under way with any uncertainty as to its direction or where the responsibility or power lies, it will be a difficult project.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee,</em> 15 January 2008; c 361.]</p><p>That makes his decision on regional transport capital grants all the more contrary.</p><p>I could not speak in a debate on local government finance without referring to Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council's fair share campaign. Those councils have historically had a poor share of the overall budget. The previous Administration had started, albeit slowly, to turn that around, and the councils were edging towards receiving a fairer share of the Scottish budget. This year, that has been reversed and Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire have received the worst settlement that they have ever had: respectively 85 per cent and 88 per cent of the Scottish average. That is grossly unfair. I ask Mr Swinney to explain how that has come about and to examine the distribution elements within GAE to bring about a fairer settlement.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13398295", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2008"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry; I have only just started.

We see cuts in the bus service operators grant and concessionary fares and the ending of schemes such as the DRT grant, the rural public transport grant, the bus route development grant, the public transport fund and the integrated transport fund. Over the next three years, the Government is cutting funding for bus services by 9.2 per cent in real terms.

It is part of the global energy market. It will have to work within the powers reserved to the UK government ... The Scottish Executive will need to work in harmony with the UK\".</p><p>Working in harmony with the UK Government is not something that the SNP has yet perfected. Can we hope that it is prepared to give it a go on such an important matter?</p><p>The right strategy will have to be effective in tackling climate change, but it will also have to promote sustainable economic growth, deliver security of supplies through a diversity of supply, and eradicate fuel poverty. I am disappointed that the UK bill is silent on fuel poverty.</p><p>I believe that the UK Government is wrong to press forward with a new generation of nuclear power. Nuclear power remains unwanted, unsafe and uneconomic. The market is rigged in favour of the nuclear industry. Billions of pounds of public money have gone into research and development for nuclear energy, compared with the tiny amounts that have gone into research for other forms of energy. There is a real risk that focusing on new nuclear plants will undermine attempts to find a cleaner, greener, more sustainable and <place-holder colnum=\"5152\"/> secure solution. We should be concentrating our efforts on renewables and greater energy conservation.</p><p>Urgent action is needed now at Westminster, here in Holyrood and throughout the country at local authority level. We must unite to ensure that cleaner energy sources have a competitive edge. I would like to see a step change in funding for research and development in and the demonstration of renewables and low-carbon technology.</p><p>We have seen what can happen when Governments put their minds to it. The previous Scottish Administration transformed the prospects of renewables in Scotland. I want that good work to be built on. Our manifesto proposals&#8212;which were independently assessed as being the greenest&#8212;were ambitious. We support investment in renewables, demand reduction, energy efficiency, decentralised energy and microgeneration. We need look no further than Denmark and the Netherlands for good examples of using energy production to energise regional economies and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p>I would like to take a few moments to highlight north-east Scotland's contribution. Forty years of experience in oil and gas has built Aberdeen into one of the most influential, innovative and proactive energy cities in the world. Many leading international energy companies are headquartered there, and there are around 900 energy-related businesses, agencies, government bodies and research institutes in Aberdeen city and shire. A total of 16 per cent of the region's employment is in the energy business. There is a massive bank of knowledge and expertise, which is just as important as the oil reserves that we still have. The north-east is rich in natural resources&#8212;forests, wind and wave. Harness those resources with that knowledge and the north-east will continue to be the powerhouse not only of Scotland's economy but of our future energy needs.</p><p>The north-east understands the need for action and the potential economic advantages that investment in energy research and production can bring. Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group was established six years ago. That private-public partnership was set up to identify and promote renewable energy opportunities for businesses in Aberdeen city and shire. It has around 100 members drawn from energy businesses, research institutes, oil service companies, professional consultants, economic development agencies and local authorities. That collective diversity extends into every source of renewable energy&#8212;onshore and offshore wind, wave and tidal, biomass, fuel cell, photovoltaic and <place-holder colnum=\"5153\"/> geothermal. Incidentally, the group was set up using money from the previous Administration's cities growth fund&#8212;funding that is no longer available for such initiatives. Support must continue to be provided to such initiatives. It is clear that government at all levels can be the catalyst for change by creating a supportive environment and developing markets.</p><p>What action can we take in Scotland? The SNP has not yet taken forward an energy efficiency strategy. The previous Executive drew up a draft energy strategy with a comprehensive package of measures, but the SNP Government is refusing either to publish it or to come up with one of its own. The Government should act quickly to remedy that.</p><p>We need more efficient financial instruments to support the move away from a reliance on fossil fuels. For example, the biomass industry has been disappointed that, until now, renewables obligation certificates have not covered the production of heat. I understand that things are changing, but there is not yet a commitment to the provision of heat ROCs. I hope that that will be resolved soon. It would help to encourage sensible and sustainable solutions for generating heat in off-gas areas.</p><p>I want the SNP Government to commit to a second round of the biomass support scheme. The first round, which was introduced by the previous Government, was a great success. The grants that were given generated an investment of around &#163;6 million in the north-east alone, without counting the jobs that were created and the safeguarding of existing businesses such as sawmills. The multiplier was around three times the grant funding.</p><p>As many have said, we need to promote sensible microgeneration. That must involve a review of the planning processes. At present, small schemes for a single turbine can be subjected to the same scrutiny as megawatt wind farms, which discourages people from trying to make changes.</p><p>Liberal Democrats are ambitious for Scotland. The previous Administration transformed the prospects of renewable energy. The new SNP Administration is giving mixed messages and lacks clarity, which is risking confidence in Scotland's renewables industry. The key to success will be continuing the close partnership of Government, industry and academia that is represented by FREDS&#8212;the forum for renewable energy development in Scotland. I ask the minister to confirm his commitment to that forum.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395878", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There are compelling reasons for ensuring that we have a coherent and comprehensive energy strategy for the UK, including the need to tackle climate change, the ever-increasing demand for energy, higher prices, and the decline in oil and gas resources.

From 2 June, the business that would have been heard in Inverurie will be transferred to Aberdeen city, which will leave Grampian without a court to serve the rural area.</p><p>The simple fact that the population of Aberdeenshire is steadily increasing while that of Aberdeen city is on the decline seems to have been overlooked when the decision to close the court in Inverurie was taken.

However, as a result of the decision, people will be forced to travel back into the city to attend court, often when there is heavy traffic on the roads. Many people will be forced to rely on infrequent and unreliable public transport. The decision also apparently ignores the recent trend in the court business: as the consultation paper showed, far from steadily declining, court business has climbed back in recent months to the level at which it was five years ago.

The members who have spoken so far have articulated the scale of the problem that faces our society and have highlighted the range of inequalities that still need to be tackled. Recently, I have been glad to support Patrick Harvie's proposed member's bill on hate crime and Shirley-Anne Somerville's motion supporting the women's coalition's statement of intent, each of which, in its own way, sets out to tackle important areas of inequality.</p><p>In the brief time that I have this afternoon, I want to focus on gender inequality&#8212;perhaps it is just as well that Mr Rumbles has left the chamber. There is still great gender inequality in Scotland. Men are still paid more than women, thousands of pregnant workers are treated unfairly and thousands of women are sexually harassed at work every year. Although half of us want to work more flexible hours, many of us are denied that. One woman in five faces domestic abuse, conviction rates for <place-holder colnum=\"3823\"/> rape are at an all-time low and power is still mostly held by men. We will not fix that this afternoon.</p><p>In 1975, when the Equal Pay Act 1970 came into force and the Sex Discrimination Bill was passed, I was a student at university. I remember the sense of excitement and the feeling that things were really going to change. Now, more than 30 years on, with my own daughter at university, I have a growing sense of disbelief at the lack of progress. My daughter and her friends face many of the inequalities that my friends and I faced in the 1970s. As the Equal Opportunities Commission said in its final report, there is an \"unfinished revolution\".</p><p>In 2028, we will mark the centenary of the Equal Franchise Act 1928, which was passed on 2 July 1928 and gave women the vote on equal terms with men. The Fawcett Society is campaigning to ensure that equality comes of age in the next 21 years. I commend its equal votes, equal power campaign, which seeks to close the gaps between women and men in access to power, money and justice. However, surely we must not wait another 21 years&#8212;another generation, with my granddaughter at university&#8212;before women gain real equality. The Fawcett Society says that the 21-year target reflects the scale of the current equality gap. At the current rate of change, it will take 200 years to achieve equal representation of women and men in the Westminster Parliament, although we have a better record here, as Marlyn Glen pointed out. It will take 40 years to achieve an equal number of senior women in the judiciary, 60 years to achieve an equal number of female directors of FTSE 100 companies, 80 years before the full-time pay gap closes and 140 years before the part-time gap closes.</p><p>We must still mind the gap&#8212;the UK has the biggest pay gap of all European Union countries. Women working part time earn on average 36 per cent less an hour than men working full time. Women working full time earn on average 17 per cent less an hour than men working full time. That is a disgrace. As Unison says, it is the equivalent of men getting paid all year and women working for free from 30 October. The problem affects us throughout our lives, because lower pay means that women also face a pensions gap&#8212;their retirement income is 53 per cent of men's.</p><p>Although I know that there is a need to tackle all inequalities, I am concerned about the umbrella nature of the new Equality and Human Rights Commission. There is the potential for a loss of focus on gender equality issues. The Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland's final report outlined the changes that are needed here to bring about greater equality and which should be used as the blueprint for action. Gender equality is not just good for individuals&#8212;it is good for business <place-holder colnum=\"3824\"/> and for social well-being. Equal Opportunities Scotland said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Change is about doing what makes sense for our social health and financial wealth, as well as doing what is right. Whilst our own lives are made more difficult by these inequalities, Scotland will also lose out economically if we don't tackle them. A country that doesn't use its full potential by channelling women into low paid work, forcing families to struggle to cope and losing the skills of those who cannot work and care will fall behind.\"</p><p>I note that the Government has increased the budget for equalities, but what will it do to ensure that the money is properly targeted and effective? The UK still works longer hours than other developed countries and has a culture that views the hours that someone puts in being a measure of a person's commitment to their job. Our long-hours working culture means that those who want to balance work and home life find it hard to get on in the workplace and can face discrimination. That is despite the fact that there is clear evidence that, when an employer offers flexibility in respect of working hours, everyone&#8212;female employees, male employees and the employer&#8212;benefits. In such circumstances, men get to spend more time with their families, which is important as we know that seven out of 10 dads are concerned that they do not spend enough time with their families. For women, greater sharing of caring and work enables them to thrive in the workplace. Furthermore, employers who implement such policies report higher morale, lower turnover of staff and greater productivity.</p><p>We need practical measures to ensure that everyone can benefit from such flexible working. Why is it that, in 2007, having children or becoming a carer means economic inequality for women? Why is it that flexible working is not available in all types of work, including senior roles? Why is it that pregnancy discrimination, sexual harassment and other forms of workplace discrimination are not yet eliminated? Until we transform Scotland's workplaces, our choices will remain limited. Men and women will not be able to lead family lives in a way that works for them, older women will continue to be less independent than men and our country will become less productive.</p><p>The problem is not with the limits that people have but with the limits that society places on them. We need action now and society needs to catch up. We need to close the income gap, give better support to families, modernise public services and work to deliver equal power. The EOC has spoken of an \"unfinished revolution\".

Surely all of us must be determined to see improvements to health, education and social care services for children and adults with autistic spectrum disorder.</p><p>The Scottish autism service network, which I think is unique in the United Kingdom, was developed with a &#163;300,000 package of funding from the previous Executive. It offers diagnosis information, advice and support to a number of groups, including people with autism, their families, carers and practitioners. The intention in establishing the network was to help support local agencies throughout Scotland to deliver better services for those who are affected by ASD.</p><p>I turn to the work that Robert Brown took forward when he was the Deputy Minister for Education and Young People.

I ask the minister to commit tonight to carrying forward the network's work, through continued funding, and to support fully the implementation of the make school make sense recommendations.</p><p>I want further improvements in education provision for children in Scotland with autism.

It provides a range of specialist, targeted services. The organisation runs on a shoestring. It has relied on commissioning bodies, such as councils, recognising that it offers a specialised service and funding it appropriately.</p><p>I am concerned that Aberdeen City Council has reduced the available funding for those specific services. The effect is that, in my region, a matter of miles can determine what support is available for people. That is despite the fact that Aberdeenshire Council deals with significantly more people with ASD than Aberdeen City Council deals with, which cannot be right. The Government must ensure that adequate resources are provided to ensure that councils are not forced to reduce services because of budget pressures. I have real worries about the Scottish National Party's proposed council tax freeze and the impact that it might have on similar services in the next few years.</p><p>Several issues would benefit from early discussion in the autism parliamentary network, from the general issue of how to tackle the lack of understanding of the syndrome&#8212;which exists not only among the public but, worryingly, among education, health and care professionals&#8212;to more specific issues, such as the lack of support for adults with ASD.

It is essential that the manifesto commitments that were made on extra police numbers are delivered, but the extra numbers must be distributed fairly across Scotland. The SNP must see the levelling-up process through to its conclusion, thereby ending the traditionally higher proportion of funding that is channelled to forces in the central belt.

Additionally, we are now seeing longer periods of royal court residence that require more frequent staff abstractions, as no additional resources are being made available for royal protection. The area also has lower levels of block community safety funding, much of which is currently being used to pay for police officers.</p><p>The SNP is not only backtracking on its commitment, but threatening the legacy of the previous Administration, which was a steady increase in police numbers. The offer from the SNP now seems to be a more visible police presence and additional officers through redeployment, but that is manifestly not the same as 1,000 extra police officers. Yesterday, Joe Grant, the chief executive of the Scottish Police Federation, said that the incoming nationalist Administration had made a clear promise on the issue.</p><p>People across Scotland are looking to the SNP to honour the promise of 1,000 new police officers.

I am a great supporter of buses as a means of transport&#8212;buses are one of the most flexible systems we have&#8212;but, as Malcolm Chisholm pointed out, we have the opportunity to use trams and buses to even greater effect in Edinburgh, complementing each other to cut congestion and bring about the kind of modal shift that we can only dream about with buses.</p><p>We are more ambitious than the SNP. We want Scotland to have a world-class transport system that is fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. In government, we increased transport spending to record levels and put 70 per cent of that &#163;1 billion spend into public transport. That investment was welcomed throughout Scotland. Certainty was needed to give Scotland the sustainable transport system it required. That is why national, regional and local transport strategies were developed and why they must be given due regard.</p><p>The Auditor General's report acknowledges that the Edinburgh projects</p><p class=\"indent\">\"have been through the Parliamentary approval process to obtain statutory authority to proceed and have been developed in response to national, regional and local transport strategies.\"</p><p>That is more than can be said for the SNP's transport plans. The Government is being thrawn over the Edinburgh transport projects, and showing an obstinacy that is born out of over-generous promises made during the election&#8212;promises that the SNP did not think it would have to deliver.</p><p>As Tavish Scott said, the SNP has dug itself into a hole with a series of ludicrous U-turns and misinformation. It has wasted time and untold amounts of money with its futile attempts to justify its unpopular political decision. As Sarah Boyack <place-holder colnum=\"1170\"/> said, trams are more than just an improvement to public transport&#8212;they will give rise to new jobs, new homes and many new opportunities. They are critical to delivering 35,000 new jobs in the city, and a comprehensive transport infrastructure needs to be in place to ensure that the current bus system can cope. The trams will link new communities and make a major contribution to much-needed community regeneration.</p><p>City business leaders believe that halting the trams projects would undermine economic growth and inward investment, and threaten other infrastructure proposals that are predicated on the trams going ahead. For example, we know that Telford College and Scottish Gas based location decisions on forecasts about the trams.</p><p>I am not sure that the minister has been reading the same report as me. He said that there is a litany of unfinished work and incomplete governance, but the report I read concluded that the trams project demonstrates a \"clear corporate governance structure\" with</p><p class=\"indent\">\"clearly defined project management and organisation ... sound financial management and reporting\"</p><p>good risk management procedures and a</p><p class=\"indent\">\"procurement strategy aimed at minimising risk and delivering successful project outcomes.\"</p><p>In so far as there are any problems, the report says that they are largely caused by uncertainty about whether the new SNP Administration will allow the work to go ahead. The stated utilities diversion work risk would exist in any large project.</p><p>On EARL, the report concluded that the project demonstrates sound financial management and reporting, costs</p><p class=\"indent\">\"based on a thorough estimating process\",</p><p>sound project management arrangements and good risk management. Because EARL is at an early stage, the estimated cost and time targets remain uncertain and more progress needs to be made before definite conclusions can be reached. There are issues to be addressed, but the project's foundations are unassailable.</p><p>Contrary to the claims from the SNP's front bench that costs are overrunning and out of control, the Auditor General concluded that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The cost and time targets for the Edinburgh trams project have been developed using robust systems\".</p><p>The Government has no evidence from the report to cancel the projects and it must commit to funding immediately. No major transport project is without risk, but the risks must be managed. Is the Government saying that it is not up to the job? Margaret Smith reminded us that the SNP's election slogan was, \"It's time.\" It did not tell us that it meant that it is time for uncertainty, time to <place-holder colnum=\"1171\"/> backtrack and time to unravel.

However, the Scottish Liberal Democrats believe that we must have a much wider debate than that. I remind the chamber that the previous Scottish coalition Government introduced the first-ever Scottish climate change target, which sought to exceed the Scottish share of the UK target by an additional 1 million tonnes by 2010. I believe that such a move should be applauded.</p><p>At best, when it is carried out by a reputable organisation, carbon offsetting is a short-term approach; at worst, it is a dangerous diversion from the real problem and an excuse for inaction. Organisations, businesses, and individuals striving to tackle climate change should be encouraged to consider other actions first.</p><p>It might be useful to compare the issue with what happened many years ago when waste management issues started to come to the fore. Many of the early discussions and actions focused on how and what we should recycle, and it took some time to reach a proper recognition of the fact that some key steps were being missed out. Now we have all become used to the waste hierarchy of reduce, reuse and then recycle.</p><p>We must take the same rigorous approach in tackling climate change. Indeed, before we even think about carbon offsetting, we need to take two significant steps: first, we must reduce direct emissions; and, secondly, we must work with others to reduce indirect emissions and establish markets for low-carbon energy products. Only then will it be appropriate to consider carbon offsetting and, as other members have pointed out, the integrity of the offset must be guaranteed. Offsetting must be the last resort, not the first thought. In that respect, I commend the work of the Carbon Trust, which has helped to bring about change by working with local government and the public and private sectors.</p><p>I note the Scottish Government's intention to introduce a climate change bill. We believe that such a bill and other Government action should set challenging targets for reducing carbon emissions of at least 12.5 per cent by 2010 and 60 per cent by 2050. Also, the SNP manifesto commitment to annual targets will need to be complemented by an annual report to Parliament.</p><p>However, it is imperative that, as the climate change bill is drawn up, we do not find ourselves deflected from taking action now. After all, a great deal can be done without requiring new primary legislation. We believe that early action must be taken before the bill is introduced to reduce energy use, improve energy efficiency and support <place-holder colnum=\"739\"/> microgeneration. If we are to achieve a sustainable future, energy use reduction must come first. The issue is as much about reducing energy demand as it is about generating new clean energy.</p><p>Early action brings opportunities. For example, by tackling energy efficiency and building zero-energy houses we can help to reduce fuel poverty. Given the clear link between fuel poverty and poor health, such investment can bring both direct and indirect benefits.</p><p>The development and commercialisation of new technologies must be accelerated, which is why the Scottish Liberal Democrats have proposed the establishment of a carbon challenge demonstration fund to support innovative low-carbon developments. Scotland can be a leader in this field. The country is certainly well placed to take advantage of the economic opportunities in renewable energies, biofuels, forestry and construction. Moreover, the public sector must take the lead in ensuring that all Scottish government buildings and transport become carbon neutral by 2012.</p><p>Although energy production and use are the greatest producers of greenhouse gases, transport, too, has a significant impact on the environment, and we will never truly tackle climate change if we do not address the problem of carbon emissions from and energy use of transport.</p><p>Under the previous Government, investment in public transport was at record levels. Such transport accounted for 70 per cent of funding, and that high level of investment should be retained. However, I am sad to say that the new Government's comments in the chamber over the past couple of weeks suggest that it will not be. It is simply not credible for the SNP to talk about a climate change bill while at the same time claiming that it will ditch the Edinburgh trams scheme. Scrapping major public transport projects will render existing and future plans to reduce carbon emissions unattainable.</p><p>Robin Harper's motion does not go to the heart of the issue. As a result, I move amendment S3M-173.3, to leave out from first \"notes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"applauds the introduction by the previous Scottish Government of the first-ever Scottish climate change target to exceed the Scottish share of the UK target by an additional one million tonnes by 2010; notes the intention of the current Scottish Government to introduce a climate change Bill; believes that this Bill and other government action should set challenging and achievable targets for reducing carbon emissions of at least 12.5% by 2010 and 60% by 2050; further notes the SNP manifesto commitment to annual targets to reduce carbon emissions; welcomes the commitment to a climate change Bill but believes that early action should be taken in advance of the Bill to <place-holder colnum=\"740\"/> improve energy efficiency, reduce energy use and support microgeneration; further believes that the public sector should take the lead by ensuring that all Scottish Government buildings and transport become carbon neutral by 2012; considers that carbon offsetting should normally be viewed as a last resort as a carbon reduction measure, and is concerned that the SNP Government's transport plans and opposition to public transport plans will render existing and future plans to reduce carbon emissions unattainable.\"</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384991", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carbon Offsetting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I find it interesting that the Green party has brought a debate on carbon offsetting to the Parliament.

The north-east of Scotland has been taking part in a three-year pilot project with the WWF to measure its footprint, the results of which were announced at an event in my home town of Ellon a few months ago.</p><p>We are taking far more than our fair share of the world's resources. If everyone in the world consumed resources at the rate at which we in Scotland do, we would need three planets to support us. However, none of the people who attended that event was down heartened by the results; those people were galvanised by it and are determined to tackle some of the issues that contribute to that big footprint. Local schemes that involve the whole community are now being developed in Ellon and Huntly. It is commendable that the people at the event did not say that the problem is too big for us to do anything about, but I am clear that they expect us here in Parliament also to pay heed to it and to face the fact that a three-planet lifestyle is not sustainable We can work on three main areas to shrink our footprint: energy use, food production and transport. Given that around 15 per cent of carbon emissions are land-transport related, we can make a difference: we can reduce the impact of transport. We know what the solutions are: faster trains, second-generation park and rides, new railways, trams and demand-responsive transport. There are lots of sustainable transport solutions, but they need consistent support and some certainty to make them a reality.</p><p>For decades, Scotland suffered because of a lack of vision, co-ordination and investment in transport, which the previous Government took bold steps to counter. During the previous session, there were radical changes to transport delivery, a step-change in how transport was planned for and a new optimism and growing ambition throughout Scotland as local authorities worked with other stakeholders to plan ahead. I thought that the SNP shared that ambition, given that its manifesto said, \"let us build a more successful Scotland\", \"Let Scotland Flourish\" and that it is time to move Scotland forward. However, we are not moving forward; the SNP is taking us backward to the old stop-start, will-we-won't-we school of transport planning, which I thought was a thing of the past.<place-holder colnum=\"476\"/></p><p>The Liberal Democrats recognise that planning for a sustainable Scotland needs us all to work together.

We will support the removal of tolls on the Forth, but only if the Government provides answers and clear assurances on its impact. The minister must make clear how the Government will fund the deficit; how it will resource repairs and maintenance; how it will service the debt; how it will manage congestion and deal effectively with traffic management and road safety; how it will finance the new crossing; and how it will handle the sensitive matter of the staff who are currently employed at the bridges. Those are important issues. The Liberal Democrats support Des McNulty's amendment, which is designed to ensure that the Government provides answers.</p><p>It is crucial that the Government takes action to address the increase in congestion that the removal of tolls from the Forth bridge will cause. The Liberal Democrats believe that progress on Edinburgh transport schemes such as the trams and EARL must be the foundation of that action. Scrapping tolls will increase pressure on Edinburgh's congestion levels and cutting other <place-holder colnum=\"350\"/> Edinburgh public transport projects would only add to that pressure. That is why it is so important that we consider trams and tolls in tandem. We need an integrated transport system for our capital city.</p><p>Bridge tolls became an issue for many people, especially in Fife, during the election campaign, but the priority of the Scottish Liberal Democrats is to keep Scotland moving. We want Scotland to have a world-class transport system that is fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. In Government, we increased transport spending to record levels and put 70 per cent of the &#163;1 billion transport spend into public transport. We want that level of investment to continue.</p><p>The financial consequences of a decision to terminate the tram project at this late stage would be &#163;114 million. Business leaders in Edinburgh think that halting the project would undermine economic growth and inward investment and threaten other infrastructure proposals, which are predicated on the tram project going ahead.</p><p>Mr Swinney said yesterday that he would order a financial review of all major transport projects. The message from the new Government is that no transport project&#8212;however far ahead&#8212;is safe with the SNP. That is no way to plan for the future of Scotland.</p><p>The Forth bridge is not only a local bridge but a strategic link for those of us who live in the north-east. It would be remiss of me not to refer in my first speech to the region that I represent, which includes Mr Stevenson's constituency. North East Scotland is large and diverse. It stretches from the Buchan coast to Dundee, taking in Aberdeen, Dundee, many towns and villages and extremely remote rural areas, such as Strathdon. It faces many transport issues, which are often tackled with imagination, in true north-east pioneering spirit. For example, Aberdeenshire Council has developed many excellent initiatives, such as the A2B demand-responsive transport service.</p><p>The north-east has a well-developed voluntary sector and many rural partnerships are involved in transport provision. Last weekend, Buchan Dial-A-Community Bus was named charity of the year in the <em>Third Force News </em>awards. The organisation runs a range of services and is a brilliant example of community action. I congratulate Rachel Milne and her team.</p><p>Transport is high on the agenda in the north-east, as it is throughout Scotland. Regional transport partnerships were set up to allow major transport projects to move forward in a more consensual and planned way. The partnerships have demonstrated what can be done when people work together. There is no doubt that the delivery of major transport projects needs broad support from Government, local councils, the <place-holder colnum=\"351\"/> community and the private sector. It also needs a long lead-in period.</p><p>The regional transport partnerships have worked hard during the past year to prepare strategies that plan for the next 15 years. The strategies have been consulted on, clear priorities have been developed and cross-party support has been gained. Seven finalised strategies are on Mr Stevenson's desk, awaiting approval. Therefore, I am disappointed that the first motion that the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change has lodged in the Parliament is not about pressing ahead with the Edinburgh tram project or the Edinburgh airport rail link, or about approval of the seven regional transport strategies. I am disappointed that the minister came to the Parliament not to talk about how we reduce our global footprint or about the role of transport systems in attracting inward investment to Scotland, but to talk about dialogue about removing tolls on two bridges.</p><p>Transport is fundamental to our daily lives, our economic future and the quality of our environment. Major issues must be tackled and difficult choices must be made. However, there has been no sign so far that the Government is prepared to face up to that. We have heard only populist promises from the Government. For example, on Tuesday we heard the proposal to dual the A9 all the way from Perth to Inverness. Although Liberal Democrats agree that there is a need to invest in the A9, it is an irresponsible Government that makes such grand gestures, especially when funding for the dualling will come from shelving other, well-advanced projects.</p><p>In developing Scotland's transport network, it is important to break the link between economic growth and transport growth. Reduction of carbon emissions without damaging economic performance will be critical in a future in which economic success will depend on our ability to attract and retain talent. That is why the Edinburgh tram scheme, with its projected modal shift and linking of key employment centres and travel nodes, is so important.</p><p>I am delighted that the Government has been forced to support the amendment. Mr Salmond's mantra, \"the new politics of Scotland\", must apply not just to the Opposition parties but to all members of the Parliament. We have given the Government a clear message. There is no support in this chamber for a halt to the tram project and the Edinburgh airport rail link. Mr Stevenson says that he intends to bring proposals to the Parliament soon, but prevarication will not help. It would be better if the Government acknowledged that a majority in the Parliament is in favour of the tram and EARL projects and agreed today to allow those schemes to continue as planned.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384049", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bridge Tolls"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Liberal Democrats will support the abolition of tolls on the Tay and the Forth, on which the people of Fife have made their views clear.
