It is only an opportunity and whether we take advantage of it we will know sometime in the future.</p><p>There is no doubt that those events could inspire and motivate young and old to get involved and to become more active not only over those two or three weeks but as a long-lasting legacy. If we work at it, it can be transformational. A transformation is required if we are to get people of all abilities, ages and groupings&#8212;irrespective of their background or gender&#8212;involved in sport and, of course, participating and volunteering in community sport and physical activity in the future under the banner of sport for all.</p><p>The health benefits of an active lifestyle are well known. In previous debates, the minister reminded us&#8212;I have said it before and I will say it again&#8212;of the 50 people a week in Scotland who die from inactivity and a lack of exercise. That costs the health service &#163;94&#160;million a year so, irrespective of the Commonwealth games and any other opportunities that we have to motivate and inspire people, we already have a big issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>That annual cost of &#163;94&#160;million and the accompanying death rate are an old legacy, but if we examine some of the areas in which many organisations, whether individually or collectively, are striving to increase activity among all age groups, but particularly among young people, we find that the figures on getting children active are flatlining, that children&#8217;s participation in sport has declined from its peak in 2009 and that there has been no real change in the level of adult physical activity since 2008. Therefore, the challenge is clear. If only a small proportion of the &#163;94&#160;million were spent on prevention, what a difference that would make. There is no doubt that the increased participation in sport and physical activity that would result from that would make a tremendous difference to lifestyles here in Scotland.</p><p>Of course, there are other aspects to the issue, as Liz Smith and Alison Johnstone said. Having the opportunity to participate is important in many other areas apart from health. It is important for social cohesion. James Dornan gave us an example of that when he mentioned his engagement with Tom Harris. That those two can get in a room together represents progress and shows that engagement works and can bring people together, which is important for fractured communities.</p><p>It has been argued that giving people the opportunity to participate in such activity can be particularly important in tackling crime. Midnight league football and other diversionary activities steer young people away from breaking someone&#8217;s hedge or being a general bother and help them to develop their self-esteem. From the point of view of the health agenda, they are even more important in enabling many young people to establish an interest in an activity that they can take through the rest of their lives. Investment in such activities is important and can be made regardless of the Commonwealth games; indeed, we need to make it anyway if we are to change the lifestyle of people in Scotland fundamentally.</p><p>On the legacy, the first thing that it is important to do is to understand clearly what we are trying to achieve. Are we trying to make the fundamental change that is necessary, or are we having activity for activity&#8217;s sake? I do not mean that to be pejorative. We have heard about many events that will take place, but we cannot just have a list of one-off events, even though they are important and are complementary to the games. It is necessary to put on such events to provide the welcome that we want to provide to visitors from abroad, but they cannot be taken seriously as things that will sustain activity in the longer term, which is what the preventative agenda needs to do.</p><p>If we want the legacy of the Commonwealth games to have the widest possible benefits, we need to recognise that it is not just a case of the Government putting in money and that it is not just the health and sport portfolio that has responsibility in this area. I know that there are difficulties with doing all the things that I have outlined. It is not for the Government to do all of them, although it provides a lot of the infrastructure. Sportscotland accounts for around 10 per cent of the budget, but many opportunities are delivered by other people.</p><p>We heard in our community sport inquiry about the role of local government, and we can layer on to that the leisure trusts and the community clubs, which want to protect their integrity and their influence. Joined-up working with those clubs is needed to offer facilities. The private sector delivers a lot of activity and opportunities for individuals to participate. Lessons can be learned from all that.</p><p>The foremost point is that the legacy will be delivered by people and communities. If the Government has a role, it should be to promote and support the strategic approach. What we can do to increase volunteer numbers is important. I am afraid that, as in political parties and everywhere else in life, volunteers are harder to find and retain.</p><p>A strategic approach needs to be taken to that fundamental workforce. We need to value, nurture, support and sustain it in every possible way. We need to understand where the workforce is and who the volunteers are and we need to do workforce planning to estimate the decline in numbers and the number that we need to replace annually, never mind what we need to grow the number of volunteers.</p><p>We recognise the additional challenge. Many areas with a high rate of participation in sport have a high number of volunteers, whereas nearby neighbourhoods have insufficient volunteers. We are talking about deprived communities, which have fewer volunteers. Of course, there are poorer areas such as Port Glasgow, which has a boxing club that the minister may wish to visit. Young women are involved in that club and are leading it, which is in complete contradiction of what normally happens.</p><p>All this is possible, but we need to get more strategic about what we do.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games and Legacy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are all agreed that we have an unprecedented opportunity, as someone said earlier, in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth games and, indeed, a summer of sport with the Ryder cup and other events.

As has been mentioned, that has brought some success, but it has been limited because although we have set out a plan to prevent more people from becoming involved with payday lending companies, too many are already caught in the trap.</p><p>The information that was provided by StepChange Debt Charity shows a dramatic rise in the number of people in my constituency who are seeking help with payday loans. In 2012, 16 per cent of the charity&#8217;s clients in the Inverclyde Council area had payday loans. That figure jumped to 31 per cent in the first three months of 2013. Between 2011 and 2012, the average amount owed by my constituents who were involved with payday loan companies increased by &#163;728 to &#163;1,957.</p><p>Mike MacKenzie mentioned some of the issues about getting into debt, but this is a different type of debt. It affects people who suffer financial exclusion. People in this country happily live with &#163;60,000 or &#163;100,000 of debt, but those who use payday loans do not have a credit rating. They are excluded, which is why they have to go to payday loan companies to get the help and credit that we all take for granted to get us through our lives. The clue is in the name: payday loans. It is not a coincidence that, this week, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation told us that those people were the group with the biggest increase among those who are in poverty.</p><p>The wider issues must be recognised. Although we can control and regulate the industry, we cannot control and regulate the need for people to get access to credit. What we can do with credit unions, for instance, is good, but the fundamental problem is that even people in work cannot escape the poverty of benefits or create job security for themselves. They cannot even create security for a single shift because of the inappropriate use of zero-hours contracts.</p><p>Is it any wonder that, because of the situation that such people face, they are powerless to get from a Monday to a Friday?

We had PE teachers in my day, although PE was not very exciting. On a rainy day, they used to run us up Lyle Hill from Rankin park and run us back down again. It was not very inspiring. It is important that we listen to young people and, as Stewart Maxwell says, that we prepare for the legacy from and the enthusiasm that will be focused on the Commonwealth games. We need to harness that&#8212;and I will return later to what we need to do in order to do that. There is no doubt that such preparation could be an important step in developing a lasting legacy beyond 2014&#8212;as long as we listen to young people and we put in place the things that can provide encouragement.

There is no doubt that the competitive experience as described by members such as Ken Macintosh and Colin Keir can be inspiring and can motivate young people to improve their skills.

I also thank the clerks and the team from the Scottish Parliament information centre for all their help during the process. Members of the committee undertook fact-finding visits to West Lothian and the Highlands, to see integration in action, and we appreciated the welcome that we received. I am also grateful to Lothian Centre for Inclusive Living, which hosted an event for service users and carers representing a wide range of disabled people&#8217;s organisations. Finally, I thank the cabinet secretary for his engagement with the committee and for his written responses to our report.</p><p>The bill will bring about big changes in how health and social care services are structured and managed. It will require a change in working practices among front-line staff, who must identify new ways of working across teams and departments. The committee has considered the area before. Two years ago, our inquiry into the regulation of care for older people highlighted the increasing shift to the provision of care in a person&#8217;s home rather than in a care home setting. In anticipation of the integration process, we called for a review of the national care standards, which would embed principles of independent living in the framework for the delivery of care services. We would welcome progress on that.</p><p>The bill reflects the shift in emphasis from acute care to community-based care. The Royal College of General Practitioners recognises the need for integration in responding to the growing older population. However, there remains a good deal of concern that general practitioners might not have adequate resources to enable them fully to participate in the design and planning of the new joint-working arrangements. The cabinet secretary is currently engaged in discussions on a renewed GP contract, and I ask him to report back to the committee in due course on the role that the contract will play in encouraging GPs to immerse themselves in the integration process.</p><p>I note the Scottish Government&#8217;s intention to introduce legislation to support carers through integration, but I would like more detail on that in the bill.</p><p>The bill has been drafted in the spirit of the Christie commission in that it seeks to tackle what Christie referred to as the</p><p>&#8220;unduly cluttered and fragmented &#8230; public service landscape&#8221;.</p><p>All that comes against a backdrop of an older population and the increasing demand on our public services to deliver more with less. In a healthcare setting, that marries with the objective of reducing bed blocking.</p><p>Christie also suggested that</p><p>&#8220;changes need to be driven by how we can achieve more positive outcomes&#8221;.</p><p>That is a theme to which I shall return.</p><p>Our report highlighted a number of issues on which we seek clarification from the Government on the effect of the legislation. Andrew Eccles of the Glasgow school of social work suggested a need for</p><p>&#8220;More subtle and complex engagement with some of the issues&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 10 September 2013; c 4193.]</p><p>The themes of strong leadership and cultural change came up repeatedly in evidence to the committee. There is a clear need for committed engagement among all involved in the processes. Health boards and local authorities are required to identify the structures that best suit their circumstances. Most areas have opted for the body corporate; so far, only the Highland region has adopted the lead agency model.</p><p>The vast majority of evidence has been supportive of both approaches. However, further clarity is required on how the body corporate model will operate. How will the health boards, local authorities and the new joint boards work together in practice? In particular, there appear to be concerns about a transfer of funding from acute budgets to social services. Concern has also been recorded among recipients of social care services about charging for care services when national health services are free at the point of use.</p><p>The committee has heard that around half of the total health board budgets will be under the scope of integrated plans, but there is concern about the potential for cost creep in obtaining social care services. It is important that users of the services receive assurance that they are not going to be hit with additional charges.</p><p>The bill contains significant powers for Scottish ministers. In evidence to the committee, the cabinet secretary noted his intention to lodge amendments at stage 2 that would seek to mitigate the fear&#8212;held by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and others&#8212;that too much power was being given to ministers. That is a helpful and constructive offer, and I look forward to those amendments.</p><p>I will now move on to what I consider to be the most important aspect of the bill. The legislation seeks not only to encourage health and care providers to work together more closely, but to improve the outcomes available to patients and service users. It is those outcomes that are crucial.</p><p>The legislation is to be commended for closing the gap between the provision of health and social care. It is paramount that the bill makes it easier for patients and their carers to access the services that they need. For that reason, our report highlighted the need for a</p><p>&#8220;continuous commitment to improving these individual outcomes.&#8221;</p><p>I look forward to seeing more detail at stage 2 on how that important aim will be achieved.</p><p>Although the bill rightly focuses on the provision of services, we should never forget the important role played by the third sector and independent providers. We heard repeated pleas from providers and their service users for assurance that they would be represented in the new integrated board structures. We accept that that is by no means a straightforward issue and that the Government has set out good reasons why that might not be possible. However, I call on the cabinet secretary to give due consideration to how the involvement of the third and independent sectors can be strengthened in the bill.</p><p>The process of integration is already well under way, and the committee agrees that we are heading in the right direction. However, the Parliament has a duty to ensure that the bill delivers for all those individuals and organisations that contributed to our report, for all the staff who are affected by the changes and, most important, for the patients and carers whose quality of life depends on high-quality health and care services. We will ensure that its implementation receives appropriate scrutiny.</p><p>On that basis, the Health and Sport Committee recommends that the general principles of the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill be approved.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22763087", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As convener of the Health and Sport Committee, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate.

The shipbuilding industry was not the industry that we knew. It did not employ the tens of thousands of people that it had employed in the past, due to some of the things I have referred to: we could not compete effectively and we never invested effectively. We used to build out in the rain, whereas others built inside. Shipyards across Europe and in other countries now import the steel hulls. There are no steelworkers working in the shipyards in Germany. They import from Poland and exploit the cheap labour there. We have missed those chances to keep up, so we have a small number of people building ships.</p><p>We used to call it the rent book on the Clyde.

It would make a nice start if those who receive the services, those who provide them and the Government, which develops the policy and legislation, could all agree on a clear definition of the purpose that we are chasing.</p><p>What is not in dispute is the action that all parties are taking on developing policy that will move in the direction of the personalisation of care, although that concept might still be ill-defined. We could also agree that progress on the journey has been slow and frustrating.</p><p>Some speakers here believe that we are bounding ahead and that there are no problems at all. That borders on complacency. I believe that the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013, which we supported and welcomed, and the Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Bill, which we are working on now, are both evidence of that shared frustration about how we move this agenda on.</p><p>We have come up against many barriers, which we describe generally as the need for a culture shift, the lack of leadership or whatever, but there is no accusation against this Government or indeed others that they have not tried to tackle the issue. As a group of politicians supporting the Government, we are looking for more sustained action and outcomes.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee inquiry into elderly care some 18 months ago highlighted many of the issues raised in the debate. Although the inquiry brought about a U-turn in the inspection of care homes, which we welcome, we also made recommendations on the impact of procurement and commissioning&#8212;something that was described by one of the members today as having nothing to do with the debate. There have been two committees in the Parliament that I have convened&#8212;one was the Local Government and Communities Committee. When we were confronted with a Panorama programme about e-procurement and its disastrous impact on the care of the elderly, we had an inquiry and e-procurement did not survive a week&#8212;it did not survive the session.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the world in which we live, procurement and commissioning have consistently impacted on the day-to-day care that is provided. Our ambition is to deliver more and more health services at home, which people clearly want. Whether there are pots of money or whether the budgets are shrinking, that is the right thing to do, irrespective of budgets. How do we sustain that move when we have commissioning and procurement policies that bring about the 10-minute visit&#8212;something that is bringing great reputational risk and damage to care in our communities?</p><p>There is a complete absence of continuity of care, which is a recognised principle right across the provision of care. People might get six, seven, eight, 10 or 28 carers coming into their home over a month and they do not know who is coming to visit&#8212;that issue needs to be dealt with.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee also called for a review of the national care standards in that elderly care inquiry. As I said, that inquiry was 18 months ago. The national care standards are now 12 years old. The cabinet secretary may want to respond to the points about procurement and the review of care standards. When the minister winds up, he may want to say something about that.</p><p>The lack of progress and the lack of impact on policy, standards, guidelines or legislation are not dry matters; they are very personal indeed. One of the other outcomes of the inquiry into elderly care was the announcement by the previous cabinet secretary of the inspection of elderly care services in our hospitals. The inspections produced by Healthcare Improvement Scotland have emphasised the lack of personalised healthcare plans that meet the needs of patients in the acute hospital setting.</p><p>Indeed, the most recent inspection report, for St John&#8217;s hospital in NHS Lothian&#8212;it was an unannounced inspection that came a full two years after the test inspections that showed the same things and highlighted the very same issues&#8212;states in relation to the care that is provided to dementia patients:</p><p>&#8220;Care plans were generic, pre-printed documents which were not specific to the needs of individual patients. This does not provide a clear record of the care required and given to a patient and does not demonstrate evaluation of that patient&#8217;s care.&#8221;</p><p>Two years on, despite report after report and the push or direction from the Government that was announced by the cabinet secretary on the ground, there is still an issue there with delivery.</p><p>Yesterday, I met David Robertson of the learning disabilities advocacy group, which is doing a really good job of working with health boards, with the Government&#8217;s support, to ensure that publications are fit for use by people with learning disabilities. Those campaigners are still campaigning for a voice with GPs. We know that people are entitled to an annual health check, but people with learning disabilities still have problems when calling or visiting the GP. For example, they complain about GP staff such as GP receptionists&#8212;I reminded him that many of us have had cause to complain about GP receptionists&#8212;who lack the training to engage with people with disabilities. Although the Government&#8217;s policy and drive is to create change there, their experience tells a different story.</p><p>Obviously, we also need to recognise the challenges that we face. As others have said, this is a journey and we all hope to arrive successfully, but there is a dramatic increase in demand and less public money. Governments past and present have made efforts, with cross-party agreement, to introduce change funds to provide changes in direction for budgets.</p><p>However, one thing that is missing is that the people who are in receipt of services are not at the table. The people who are debating person-centred care are the politicians and the budget holders. It is time that people power came to the table, so that we can ensure that we get a change of culture within organisations. People must have positive rights to ensure that there is the change that they deserve.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Person-centred Healthcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will begin in the same way as many other members have begun by quoting some definitions of person-centred care.

We were also aware of the Scottish Government&#8217;s short-life working group on the delivery of effective patient transport to healthcare services. The group did not report in time for the committee to reflect its work, but I detected similar themes to those that were suggested by our witnesses, and to those in Audit Scotland&#8217;s 2011 report. To recap, the findings of that report were inequity of access, poor integration, lack of leadership and planning, and poor recording of data and spend.</p><p>We conducted our own scrutiny under three headings&#8212;co-ordination, cost, and issues for remote and rural communities&#8212;and I will touch on each of those in turn.</p><p>Audit Scotland&#8217;s report said that transport should be an integral part of care planning and co-ordination. However, the tone of the evidence that we heard suggested that that is more an aspiration than a reality. The Royal Voluntary Service said:</p><p>&#8220;it needs to be built into the systems that are being created for health and social care integration.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 28 May 2013; c 3900.]</p><p>An initiative to improve the patient transport system was highlighted by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

We recognise, of course, that local variation and circumstances must be taken into account, but is now not the time for piloted and proven good practice to be applied more widely?</p><p>The auditors also found that data on transport costs for health and social care were poor. Transport on medical and mobility grounds tends to be funded by the NHS, while the cost of transport for those of limited means or who are living in remote areas is met by councils. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said that a different approach was needed but, so far, such efforts have not moved beyond small-scale projects. As the Royal Voluntary Service told us, the costs that are involved in community transport are relatively small when compared to the costs of missed appointments.

It is just as important to thank all those people who came forward over the period of the committee&#8217;s inquiry at a difficult and vulnerable time in their life and spoke out about the failings in terms of the patient experience. I am speaking on behalf of the Juszczak family in my constituency and the family of Anne Fisher, who is sadly deceased, who spoke out at a very difficult time. All those contributions ensured that the Health and Sport Committee approached the whole issue with sensitivity and consensus.</p><p>Access to medicines is a big, complex and deeply emotive issue. The committee first looked at the matter in March 2012 when we received a trio of petitions on orphan medicines. Now, as they say, for the science bit: orphan medicines are those used to treat very rare diseases. We have learned a lot in the past 18 months and I hope to share some of it with members in the next 13 minutes.</p><p>I want to retrace our steps as a reminder of why we are discussing the issue today. Along with the usual who, what and when, I will set out the main findings of the report that we published in early July, which is the how. I shall also offer some thoughts on yesterday&#8217;s statement from the cabinet secretary in the where-we-are-headed bit.</p><p>My colleagues on the Public Petitions Committee deserve credit for their role in this story. It was with their committee that the petitioners first raised their concerns. The petitioners were Alastair Kent, Allan Muir, Lesley Loeliger and Professor Peter Hillmen, individuals working on behalf of Rare Disease UK, the Association for Glycogen Storage Disease, and PNH Scotland, respectively. I am sure that they would all acknowledge the work on an earlier petition of January 2008 by Tina McGeever, on behalf of the late Mike Gray, which resulted in revision of the guidelines to the end-to-end process, which is the licensing of medicines through to individual patient treatment requests, or IPTRs.</p><p>The petitioners argued that the revision had not resulted in improved access to orphan medicines for patients with rare diseases. The committee took evidence last March from the petitioners and then from the Scottish Medicines Consortium, the SMC, and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the ABPI. I apologise for all the acronyms&#8212;it is like a secret services convention.</p><p>We followed up the earlier evidence with evidence from clinicians and patient representative bodies. On 14 November 2012, the cabinet secretary announced the Routledge and Swainson reviews. The committee heard from the authors of the reviews and from the cabinet secretary and the chief pharmaceutical officer on 7 May 2013. On 21 May, we held a further round-table session with interested parties to gauge reaction to the twin reviews. The report of the committee&#8217;s findings was published on 3 July. The committee found that there is enthusiasm from all quarters to work together to improve the system for accessing new medicines and create a system that enables a wider assessment of their value with more of what might be termed a societal dimension.</p><p>Our report welcomes the recommendations from Swainson and Routledge, but we want both the IPTR and the SMC processes to be improved to ensure that we have a more transparent system for accessing new medicines. In short, we want more yeses. Many of the suggestions in the reviews are welcome, including those on meetings being held in public, the standardisation of paperwork, the monitoring of applications and the publication of decisions, but they are about process and would do little to improve access.</p><p>One of the difficulties with the IPTR system lies in establishing the exceptionality of the patient&#8217;s circumstances. We said that the Scottish Government must outline the steps that it will take to improve the system. Decisions on whether to recommend a medicine for use in Scotland depend on the cost of the additional quality-adjusted life years&#8212;a system known as QALY. I hope that the official reporters have a glossary, because there are a lot of acronyms in this area. Nobody told us of a better system than QALY for assessing the value of competing treatments. Who knew that an equation could be as brutal as cost divided by the number of weeks for which a life might be extended?</p><p>However, the way in which so-called modifiers are applied is crucial in determining the cost effectiveness of medicines. We asked the SMC and the Scottish Government to review how modifiers and thresholds are applied to take better account of orphan and ultra-orphan conditions, end of life and innovation. After all, our work began with the petitions on orphan and ultra-orphan medicines.</p><p>We welcomed the interim &#163;21&#160;million rare conditions medicines fund, but questions remain about the extent to which it can improve access to medicines. The committee said that clear guidance should be published and that decisions about specific cancer medicines should be made on the same basis as decisions on medicines for other conditions. We said that cancer should not be singled out in comparison with other life-shortening conditions. The committee accepted that this was a difficult issue. Nevertheless, we did not believe that a cancer drugs fund was the Scottish answer.</p><p>The committee recognised that there were concerns about the impact of innovative medicines not routinely being available in Scotland and we asked the Scottish Government to investigate. Likewise, we said that developments with value-based pricing, or VBP, should be monitored.</p><p>I am afraid that I do not have time to tell you about ADTCs, which are area drug and therapeutics committees, about PPRS, which is the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme or about NICE, which is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. I could say &#8220;NICE but naughty&#8221;&#8212;speaking of which, I note that it was only yesterday morning when we received a copy of the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to our report. That is a shame, as we would have liked to have fully considered it and come to a view as a committee.</p><p>What I can say is that I appreciate the language and the intention of what is proposed. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing wants to move to a more flexible approach to the evaluation of medicines for end-of-life care and rare conditions and he wants to increase access to new medicines, which is good. The committee and the cabinet secretary are on the same page, but we need to see the detail, which is where the devil lurks, as always.</p><p>The Scottish Government says that value-based pricing will not be delivered. It believes that the pricing element of pharmaceutical price regulation is a reserved matter but medicines assessment is devolved, and it will develop a new value-based assessment, or VBA, process for Scotland.</p><p>As a first step, the SMC has begun to look at the evaluation of orphan, ultra-orphan and end-of-life medicines. That is to include a review of the wider aspects of value and QALYs to increase access to those medicines. The report states that the SMC is due to report its findings to the cabinet secretary before Christmas. As somebody once said,</p><p>&#8220;I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by&#8221;.</p><p>Let this please be one of those deadlines that we are able to stick to. That is particularly important for those who have been diagnosed with these conditions last week or today, or who will be diagnosed with them tomorrow or next week. Some consideration should be given to how the system operates in the transitional phase, but we need to stick to the deadline.</p><p>The IPTR system is being replaced with a new peer approved clinical system&#8212;PACS. We are told that guidance will be published shortly and I seek assurances that the old double act of &#8220;postcode&#8221; and &#8220;lottery&#8221; are not reunited by PACS.</p><p>In all honesty, it is hard to tell whether the committee&#8217;s recommendations will be matched by the new systems, as we are short of information. I would be grateful if the cabinet secretary could offer some clues about timescales.</p><p>We are told that the rare conditions medicines fund will continue until 2016, but it is still unclear whether the &#163;20&#160;million is an annual budget or total funding until 2016. I would be obliged if the cabinet secretary could elaborate.</p><p>The Scottish Government agrees that there should be scope for a temporary pause in the appraisal process to permit further dialogue with the manufacturer. That was a recommendation from Routledge and the committee welcomed it. The Scottish Government says that a pause would allow a confidential discussion with the manufacturer about cost through a new or improved patient access scheme. However, no picture has yet emerged of how the scheme will look.</p><p>I have another one for the cabinet secretary, who I appreciate is listening patiently&#8212;I hope that he is not getting writer&#8217;s cramp as a result of taking notes.</p><p>There is to be &#163;1&#160;million of funding for the SMC&#8217;s engagement with the public and the pharmaceutical industry, but it is not clear whether more money would be required following the development of VBA.</p><p>Scepticism is a good thing, but let us give credit where credit is due. I sense that the direction in which we are heading is the right one. The frustration, for me, is that we have yet to arrive.</p><p>I want to say something more about the cost side. It is clear that the Scottish Government considers there to be a devolved element in that regard, and I want to make a couple of observations. In March, the chief executive officer of GlaxoSmithKline described the often-mentioned $1&#160;billion research and development price tag as</p><p>&#8220;one of the great myths of the industry&#8221;.</p><p>I think that that is significant and interesting. Doctors Without Borders said:</p><p>&#8220;It is true that innovative new drugs can change the way we treat people and we need more of them. But innovation is of little use if people cannot access new treatments because they are so expensive.&#8221;</p><p>The pricing of medicines is, in many ways, a global issue. The issue is big, complex and deeply emotive&#8212;we had better believe it.</p><p>I commend the inclusive and listening approach of the person who will speak next in the debate. We have come a long way, policy-wise, in the past 18 months. Things have moved relatively quickly since the committee took evidence, and we welcome announcements. However, things can never move quickly enough for people who are diagnosed with rare conditions and terminal diseases. Three months is a lifetime to such people.</p><p>I hope that the cabinet secretary will report back to us on progress by December. Perhaps he can give us that undertaking. The committee believes that we can improve the processes. We can remove some of the bumps in what clinicians call the patient journey, and we can devise a system that is fair, objective, transparent, robust and within our means.</p><p>We need to ensure that there is access for all people who have orphan and ultra-orphan and life-threatening diseases. That is what people petitioned the Parliament for. We owe them nothing less and they deserve nothing less.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698796", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to New Medicines"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I thank the clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre and all those who contributed written evidence and gave of their time to participate in the committee&#8217;s public sessions.

It operated from a small backroom in the RCPE buildings with just two part-time staff&#8212;its medical director, Dr Eileen Crofton, the wife of Sir John Crofton, and its secretary, Alison Hillhouse, who became ASH Scotland&#8217;s chief executive in 1984.</p><p>The world was very different then and smoking was accepted as the norm in Scotland in public and private. People then were just as likely to see somebody smoking in hospital as we are to see people smoking outside a hospital entrance now, since action has been taken. ASH Scotland campaigned to limit the influence of the tobacco industry through advertising and sponsorship, to increase tobacco taxation, to create smoke-free places and to provide advice to smokers who wanted to quit.</p><p>ASH Scotland worked hard to communicate to policy makers the evidence of the harm that smoking does. Many of us will remember the successful publication in 1982 of the facts constituency by constituency&#8212;that is almost the norm now&#8212;to influence politicians and to make the Scottish epidemic more vivid to parliamentarians.</p><p>By the late 1990s and into the new millennium, ASH Scotland had grown from two people to nearly 20 and offered the public specialist tobacco information and smoking cessation services. It also developed and delivered projects to reduce the health inequalities resulting from tobacco.</p><p>The 2000s saw a raft of strong controls on tobacco from Holyrood and Westminster. Scotland led the United Kingdom by introducing smoke-free public places in 2006. We also saw a UK-wide ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship and a rise in the minimum age of sale from 16 to 18, along with graphic warnings on each pack and the expansion throughout Scotland of free national health service support for people who want to stop smoking.</p><p>Forty years of action on smoking and health is the proud boast of ASH Scotland. Although it would not claim to have done all that on its own, it has worked with organisations such as the British Heart Foundation and the Government to achieve a legacy of which to be proud in highlighting the hazards and risks of smoking for individuals, groups, children and young people.</p><p>Since ASH Scotland was formed more than four decades ago, the number of adults in Scotland who smoke has more than halved, from 50 per cent of the population in the early 1970s to less than 25 per cent today. That means that about a million fewer adults in Scotland are now smoking.</p><p>We cannot discuss the ASH Scotland story without mentioning the impact that it has had in the Parliament. No one who was in and around the Parliament in the lead-up to and during the passage of the bill that introduced the ban on smoking in public places could have been unaware of the campaigning zeal of ASH Scotland&#8212;it could not be ignored. Its impact in the Parliament was significant as it pushed and encouraged us to make decisions that, it must be conceded, resulted in what some people described as a ban too far, although others described it as the single biggest public health measure that we could have taken to improve the health of the people of Scotland.</p><p>That was when I and many others came across the organisation up close. I confess that, as a member of the then Health Committee, which scrutinised the bill, I was sceptical about what the ban could achieve and what was possible. I was unconvinced not about the harm of smoking but about what we could achieve. I asked many tough questions of organisations and others throughout that process.</p><p>It was a tough gig to be on that committee. The then convener, Roseanna Cunningham, was uncompromising. She dragged us off to Dublin on a fact-finding mission. We visited bar after bar in the Temple Bar area long into the night, with many hours given to the examination of the impact of the smoking ban in Ireland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: ASH Scotland&#8217;s 40th Anniversary"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been a long day and I thank all the members who have been able to stay behind and, of course, all those who signed the motion.

It is worth noting that the justice aspects of the forum posed some difficulties as we took evidence. On one hand, our committee&#8217;s focus was clearly on health and wellbeing. On the other, a number of witnesses suggested to us that the absence of accountability itself proved detrimental to the health and wellbeing of some survivors. There was a difficulty in that.</p><p>We did not ignore the justice-related issues as we heard and listened to them, but we had to make it clear to the witnesses that we were not considering in depth issues such as the time bar and consultation. We heard, listened to and recorded their evidence on them and we respectfully suggest that, if those matters need to be dealt with, that should be done by the Justice Committee.</p><p>Therefore, I will concentrate my remarks on the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s work, with a particular focus on the national confidential forum.</p><p>Sorry is the hardest word and even more difficult than saying the word is acting upon it. Nine years ago, Jack McConnell stood where the cabinet secretary is sitting and offered a full apology to adult survivors of childhood abuse. The then First Minister said:</p><p>&#8220;we in the Parliament, on behalf of the people of Scotland, recognise that they were wronged and that we will do more to support them in the future than we have ever done in the past.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 1 December 2004; c 12389.]</p><p>The national confidential forum will provide a voice to some who, until now, have been denied the right to have their say. One participant in the time to be heard pilot forum told of their experience of abuse in a children&#8217;s home in the 1940s. They had to shoulder that burden alone for 70 years. It is unimaginable.</p><p>The forum will certainly meet the needs of some people but it will not satisfy everyone. The expectations of the survivor community are high and anyone who has spent time with survivors, as we did in our engagement, can tell members that they place great value on trust. However, their trust is fragile. People have been promised help in the past, only to be let down.</p><p>Therefore, we were pleased to hear that the Scottish Government is contributing to the interactive process. There is also activity on the civil litigation time bar and other justice-related issues. I am sure that we all agree that that momentum must be maintained if the interests of all survivors are to be served.</p><p>The committee heard evidence at stage 1 from individuals, survivors groups, children&#8217;s organisations, care providers, regulators and human rights experts. One witness told us:</p><p>&#8220;Survivors will judge the process, the bill, the act and the national confidential forum on the personal outcomes for them.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 23 April 2013; c 3640.]</p><p>For those who choose to participate in the forum, it is crucial&#8212;we heard it time and again&#8212;that support be provided before they take part so that they know what to expect out of it and what the process will be. An element of support is also needed during and, indeed, after the process because, as we heard, there is a real risk of retraumatisation as a result of it.</p><p>Another issue on which we took evidence was the exclusion of those who had been in foster care. We would like that part of the eligibility criteria to be given further consideration. Kathleen Marshall, who was involved in the time to be heard pilot and was formerly Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, told us that it was an area from which there was most to learn, and learning lessons was something of a theme in what we heard.</p><p>The Care Leavers Association said that measures and outcomes were all fine and well, but that</p><p>&#8220;A life in care and beyond care is much bigger than that ... this debate brings in the emotional side&#8212;the love, care and support that are seriously lacking in our current care system&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 23 April 2013; c 3659.]</p><p>How the work of the national confidential forum will inform in practice that care system now and in the future is not entirely clear from the bill. The centre for excellence for looked after children in Scotland asked for more detail; perhaps the minister will be able to elaborate later. The Church of Scotland raised the point about exploring links between the forum and the care providers, and we took other evidence on that, so I hope that that point is taken up.</p><p>We acknowledge the wider approach that is being taken by the Scottish Government via its survivors strategy. We recognise that access to counselling, support, mental health services and advocacy is crucial. From the evidence that we took, we saw the need for a choice of accessible services, long-term support and a skilled mental health workforce. The Health and Sport Committee welcomes the therapeutic value that the national confidential forum will bring. We recall that apology from the First Minister in 2004 and pledge to do more to help those who were abused as children in the care of the state. There is a moral imperative here. A tailored choice of therapeutic supports and other remedies should be available to survivors.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694151", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, express my thanks and appreciation for all those who allowed us to do our job in support of the Justice Committee in considering the bill, with a particular focus on the national confidential forum.

The World Health Organization and others have stated that, unless we shift power and wealth, we will not deal with health inequalities. The conditions that people have to put up with also have an impact on their wellbeing. The heart disease rate is 50 per cent higher in lower-grade employees, and mortality rates for temporary workers are 20 per cent higher than those for permanent workers. Those are the hard realities of what people face.</p><p>Some people say that the situation has never been any different and that, if employers get a free hand, they will exploit workers.

The SCVO submission continued:</p><p>&#8220;There is nothing in the current budget structure - on the face of it - that would serve as the necessary catalyst for this change.&#8221;</p><p>Another concern was mentioned by the BMA, which stated:</p><p>&#8220;The reduction in eHealth funding is concerning given that the Government is expecting IT integration between health and social care&#8221;.</p><p>We need to be clear that, as part of that process, investment in information technology is carried through.

Men and women can commonly expect to spend, respectively, about seven and nine years in poor health. Scotland&#8217;s national dementia strategy tells us that approximately 71,000 people in Scotland have dementia and that the figure is likely to double in the next 25 years. On Tuesday, the Finance Committee was the latest parliamentary committee to highlight the significant demographic change, which the Office for Budget Responsibility has identified as the key source of long-term pressure on public finances.</p><p>Local authorities, which are contending with increased demand and less money, and health services, which are having to deal with and manage unplanned admissions, clearly need no reminding of the task or the situation that we face. Despite the recognition of the challenge of delivering health and care services at a time of rising demand and reduced finances, despite the work of committees of the Parliament&#8212;through my convenership of the former Local Government and Communities Committee and the Health and Sport Committee I, like others, have been on the case for a considerable time&#8212;and despite the work of Beveridge and Christie, and the Government and others, progress has been slow and patchy.</p><p>It is good that we have arrived at the current point, because we cannot continue as we are. It is important that we move forward and instigate significant cultural change in the delivery of services. If we are to address the huge challenges that are to come, as the cabinet secretary recognises, the integration of health and social care must be at the heart of that change. However, as he knows and has referred to today, the barriers are significant. Reform of public services is difficult. If it were easy, we would have done it.</p><p>It is worth recognising that sustained cultural change can be achieved best through working in co-operation, however difficult that can sometimes be. If we are to achieve change, it cannot be seen to be done simply because of financial pressures. The truth is that we should have been doing this many years ago when there was more money. The objective is to improve services, and we must be careful not to lose the focus on that. As we have seen with self-directed support, change cannot be perceived as a cheap option. If the major budget holders&#8212;the Government, the health service and local authorities&#8212;are still wrestling with one another and do not trust one another to share or shift budgets, is it any wonder that the minor parties in the process, the third and independent sectors, feel put upon, as my Health and Sport Committee colleague Aileen McLeod referred to?</p><p>That tension seeps into the workforce and into public perception. People are sometimes fearful about change and think that the process will lead to a decline in standards or working conditions. Although the Health and Sport Committee of course wants the focus to be on putting the person first&#8212;we all agree on that&#8212;we need to address such fears and concerns.</p><p>We have had the current national care standards for 10 years. Before the bill is introduced, we need to produce a new set of national care standards, which has human rights at its heart, to reassure all the people who use and work in the health service that the main objective of the integration process and the bill is to maintain and improve the services that we provide.</p><p>We need to ensure that we have good regulation when those rights are established. If we are to ensure that rights and standards are properly implemented, maintained and monitored, it is essential that we bring together and properly resource and fund the care inspectorate and Healthcare Improvement Scotland.</p><p>We must deal honestly with a commissioning and procurement process that is predatory and causes great mistrust and pain in the third sector, where we see people shuffling along their problems. It is unfortunate that the process is often regarded not as improving services and efficiency but as a crude attempt to drive down costs at the expense of quality. Committees of the Parliament have dealt with some of the worst excesses during the past few years.</p><p>If we are saying that the integration of health and social care is the most important issue, we cannot ignore workforce planning in the area. The people who work in the area deserve and must have our respect.

However, as Jackson Carlaw pointed out, that is not the point. Significantly, the budget is not keeping pace with the increasing cost of health service inflation, which, as everyone knows, is a serious problem. It is difficult to keep pace because of the increased demand for staffing resulting in increased staffing costs and&#8212;as has been highlighted over the past few days&#8212;an increase in prescription costs. Those are all demands on our health service.</p><p>We are also well aware of the projected 67 per cent increase in the population with a disability over the next 20 years, of the fact that the number of over-85-year-olds will double over the same period and of the estimated 40 per cent increase in heart disease, stroke and dementia by 2025. It is in that context&#8212;not the context of one year to another, or of one Government to another&#8212;that we must ensure that our health service sustains and maintains its reputational value to us all.</p><p>Warning signs abound. There is a &#163;1 billion maintenance backlog. I concede that perhaps half of that is more serious, but even half of that figure is an indication that we are unable, at this time, to maintain the fabric of hospital buildings.</p><p>There is an amber warning from Audit Scotland about financial planning. Boards are selling off the family silver to get from one year to another. We understand what will happen if that is allowed to continue. The Argyll and Clyde NHS Board is no longer here because it tried to sell off land to survive and pay its bills, which, of course, got larger and larger. Audit Scotland also points out the significant high risk relating to the efficiencies that need to be made in our health service. The risk of health boards not meeting the efficiency savings is another warning sign.</p><p>To return to Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s point, the warning signs have been well recognised and they are accepted across the board. They must be addressed. There are concerns that were not addressed as they should have been during the period of the previous cabinet secretary. We have not heeded Campbell Christie&#8217;s warning to radically change the health service strategy to one of prevention. We have not made a fast enough change in pace to integrate health and social care. We still do not have a clear understanding of how the budgets work between local government and the health boards, or of what they do and what they are expected to do. There are big gaps.</p><p>Plaudits are given to the health service staff&#8212;we have done that in all our speeches&#8212;but they are used as a shield so that no criticism can be made. Let us listen to them. The Royal College of Nursing said quite clearly that there is a difference between protecting the budget and protecting the quality of services; the British Medical Association says that we cannot go on as we are; the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations says that we cannot continue in the same way; Unison says that salami slicing of the budget cannot go on forever; and RCN-BMA says that the lack of joined-up thinking in the workplace is not acceptable.

As we know&#8212;actually, we cannot believe it&#8212;Greenock has turned into a gateway to Scotland for more than 60,000 passengers every year. We are constrained only by the physical resources. We have had positive discussions with Scottish Government ministers about a bid to extend the quay and the quayside. This week, I had an update from Scottish Enterprise and the urban regeneration company on that project, which should increase the number of passengers.</p><p>The passengers flow out of the area, because they come to visit Glasgow and Edinburgh, but there are significant benefits for us locally. We look for a bit in return. We are the gateway. The visitors flow into Glasgow and other places and we will never be able to compete with the bigger venues for conferences, but we ask Glasgow in particular to recognise the wider offer.</p><p>The experience that people have in Scotland should not be bound to the cities. We should make connections out into places such as Inverclyde where, 20 minutes away, people can sail on the Firth of Clyde in conditions that Chay Blyth considers some of the best sailing in the world. It is less than an hour from the SECC.</p><p>People could come down and have lunch on one of those massive cruise liners that come and visit. They could also visit the film set of &#8220;Waterloo Road&#8221;, which is one of the most popular dramas in the UK, with 5 million viewers every week. The important point is that we recognise that getting people into the area transforms their mindset that this is an old shipyard town and allows them to see the area&#8217;s potential for the future. Of course, there is also the effect on the sense of pride of local people, who will welcome visitors to the area.</p><p>Finally, we are also giving notice that we want to break into the small conference business market. The new Beacon arts centre, which has been supported by successive Governments here in the Scottish Parliament and by the lottery, will open shortly. With that 500-seat theatre, we will have an opportunity to work in that market and to make a claim for small conferences. Maybe a new hotel will spring up to support that initiative and will work alongside the existing budget hotels as well as Gleddoch House, which has all the leisure facilities&#8212;golf and everything else&#8212;with spectacular views over the Clyde. That is all only 20 minutes from Glasgow airport.</p><p>Although I recognise that we will never compete with the big boys, it is important that people recognise the wider offer and the facilities that are on their doorstep that will enhance the experience of those who attend conferences. Although my comments today might be ambitious or speculative, I think that I can say with certainty that all those who have had the experience of visiting Inverclyde will recognise that there is nothing uncertain about the warm welcome that visitors will get when they arrive in Inverclyde.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677602", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Business Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I ask myself why I am speaking in a debate about business tourism.

At a time of disinvestment, it is even more important to plan that disinvestment. It is up to Scotland&#8217;s policy makers, as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has said, to secure social justice and sustainable economic growth. The real test will be achieving fairness in the midst of cuts. Deciding how to cut spending and who should take more of the strain is even more important than deciding how much that cut should be.

We hear the minister&#8217;s justifiable claims for improvement in investment, but we must also recognise that the strategy has serious challenges.</p><p>A point that I need to make, which has not been made too often, is that the issue is not just for the addicts. The families and communities that live with the problem should not be forgotten, and the enforcement aspects cannot be forgotten. There are low seizures of heroin in this country, which indicates where more work can be done. There are genuine worries about increasing use of cocaine, there is recent evidence of widespread use of so-called legal high drugs, and more evidence is coming forward on the long-term harmful effects of cannabis use. We should not forget that.</p><p>Obviously, one issue that we are focusing on is that drug deaths in Scotland are at a 10-year high&#8212;the figure is as high as or higher than that in any other European country. Tragically, problem drug users have increased in my constituency since 2006. The current estimate is that there are 1,400, which is up from 600 in 2006. I have raised that issue not only today; last year, I had the opportunity to discuss with the minister last year&#8217;s peak of drug deaths. There are also the 20 deaths that we have faced this year. They are all tragedies.</p><p>We must conclude or concede that topping up with methadone is a high-risk activity, and it should be recognised as that. In more than 50 per cent of the deaths in Inverclyde, methadone and topping up with it were issues. As I say, it needs to be recognised as a high-risk activity, and we need to implement measures to deal with it.</p><p>We are not talking about the investment or the strategy today; rather, we are talking about outcomes. The strategy&#8217;s focus on the benefits of a focus on recovery was clear, but we still do not know how many drug users are being prescribed methadone across Scotland, how many are leaving the programme drug free, or how long they have been on the programme. There are no benchmarks for recovery that are based on the drug strategy, so we have no way of knowing how far down the road to recovery we are or how far there is to go before the goal of recovery-focused treatment for all drug users is realised. Until we get those benchmarks, we cannot examine what works and does not work.</p><p>We must recognise that not all the 60,000 drug users whom Willie Rennie mentioned are recoverable. That is a horrible and hard thing to say, but some people take drugs because they enjoy them. They are in a particular age group, and will continue to take drugs and the top-up of methadone. That is the tragic reality. We also need to face up to the fact that some grandparents, who have been mentioned, have been heroin users for many years. They now take drugs just to feel normal&#8212;not to socialise or to have a party, but just to feel normal. It is unlikely that we will move those people on, so some radical strategies probably need to be applied to that group. They are not interested in or committed to recovery and are expending or soaking up money that could be used to support those who are committed to the programme. We cannot ignore that. That is one of the issues that we need to face up to.</p><p>We need to test people&#8217;s commitment. People who are on the methadone programme should be tested regularly for topping up in order to identify their commitment, keep them safe and ensure that they are complying with the programme. If they are not complying and are not committed to recovery, appropriate action needs to be taken. If they are not committed to the programme, we cannot extend our commitment. The precious resources need to be shifted to ensure that those who are committed to recovery get the best treatment to ensure the best opportunity for recovery.</p><p>I see that the minister is not in her place, but I hope that she will read the Official Report of the debate, take on some of those ideas and feed them into the review of the strategy that is under way.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676313", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I give notice that I want to make a number of points and do not have enough time to take interventions.

The mention of Black&#8217;s in the motion caught my eye. and I thought that there was an opportunity for me to lead into scouting in Inverclyde. Black&#8217;s of Greenock was established when Thomas Black gave up his seagoing and established a sailmakers in Greenock in 1861. It is good to see that his name goes on long after him.</p><p>Remembering scouting in Greenock and district gives me the opportunity to say that scouts there will recognise the efforts and achievements of the 5th Fife scout group of Kirkcaldy because, in the past 10 years, scouts in Inverclyde have won the championship in 2002 and 2009. I suppose that we are here to boast as well and share the congratulations.</p><p>Scouting in the Inverclyde area has been long established. Members may know the Everton campsite, which was established in 1923. However, the scouting movement is not just a historical fact, of course; it is alive and surviving&#8212;indeed, it is thriving&#8212;and it has a future. There are just over 1,600 Inverclyde scouts, which is an increase of more than 100 per cent since 2007, among the communities of Wemyss Bay, Inverkip, Gourock, Greenock and Port Glasgow right up to Quarrier&#8217;s Village. They must be doing something right.</p><p>Although he would deny it, the scouts are ably led by the irrepressible and ever-enthusiastic district commissioner, David McCallum, who makes not only scouts but MSPs work. I do not know how many events we have attended this year. There was the presentation of the millennium awards in St Patrick&#8217;s school in February. Apart from the Queen&#8217;s visit, of course, the single biggest event in the jubilee celebrations in Greenock was the scouts event. I joined them for that in Westburn church in June. The gang show will take place in November&#8212;David McCallum is organising it as we speak. Those events happen only because of the commitment of the volunteers. David McCallum would probably reject my mentioning him only, but I cannot mention all the volunteers and he represents an enthusiasm and commitment to serving the scouts well.</p><p>In all the events, activities and achievements that have been mentioned and will, it is hoped, be accomplished, one of the proudest achievements that the scouts talk about is the initiative at Glenburn special needs school. There are 40 beavers and cub scouts there, supported by a dedicated team that ensures that even the most vulnerable children in our community can participate in scouting.

That inspiration, bounce and energy is something that we all want to continue into the build-up to Glasgow 2014. It was well described by a witness from Active Stirling, who told the committee about Andy Murray tweeting his 400m &#8220;split time&#8221; as compared with Mo Farah&#8217;s. It caused quite a stir online, apparently. The witness also said:</p><p>&#8220;It is not about someone trying to be a gold-medal tennis player or 10,000m athlete, but it is vital that we capture the motivation that performance sport can give to physical activity.&#8221;</p><p>There was mention of a &#8220;double-strand pathway&#8221;, which sounds high-falutin&#8217;, but just means both focusing on the elite side and ensuring that my granddaughter will still want to go swimming when she is a teenager.</p><p>Our inquiry addresses three policy strands: the contribution of volunteers, the impact of sports clubs on their communities, and the importance of facilities&#8212;or, if you prefer, people, participation and places. It is people&#8212;the volunteers and the can-doers&#8212;who make community sport what it is.</p><p>A gentleman from Argyll and Bute Council told us:</p><p>&#8220;community sport hubs are not about buildings ...

He also said:</p><p>&#8220;If the netball girls said, &#8216;We&#8217;d love to get new tunics, but we can&#8217;t afford them,&#8217; we would get them tunics.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 11 September 2012; c 2585, 2586.]</p><p>He said that small things made a big difference.</p><p>Other witnesses spoke of the social value of local clubs. We were told that the clubs provide a network of volunteers, foster a sense of belonging, and bring people together through a sense of pride and collective purpose. It was even suggested that their strength can provide an indication of the levels of wellbeing in our communities.</p><p>Development of community sport hubs is the prevailing direction of policy, and we heard much that sounded positive in that regard. However, several witnesses advised us not to overlook the clubs and individuals&#8212;who we all know about&#8212;that do valuable work outside that model.</p><p>It is crucial that we increase participation, particularly among hard-to-reach groups such as young people in deprived areas, teenage girls, black and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, those who have been put off sport at school and the older generation.</p><p>It was Mark Twain who said:</p><p>&#8220;I am pushing 60.

NHS Scotland therefore chose to try something different in putting together the fit for girls project. Rather than seeing the girls as the problem, it asked whether it might not be better to seek their buy-in at the point of design. The Robertson Trust echoed the approach, pointing to the success of its girls on the move initiative, which it said was achieved by allowing the target group to have a say in the development of the programme in a way that ensured that the girls were able to take part in activities that were of interest to them, such as dance, boxercise and yoga. The result of that approach was an impressive rate of continued participation, promoting personal development alongside the girls becoming more active.</p><p>We frequently hear that there are not enough facilities, that they are expensive, that they are difficult to reach, or that they are of poor quality. Access to the schools estate and the facilities that are springing up appears to be a recurring theme in our evidence. Sportscotland is to report on the matter, and that report will be keenly read, even if it is published outwith the timeline of our inquiry.</p><p>Schools are part of what is out there&#8212;or, perhaps, what is not out there.

Some concerns occur again and again. Patients are not being routinely assessed for dementia or cognitive impairment upon admission. Indeed, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh recently reinforced that concern by stating that almost half of elderly patients on wards have dementia but have not been diagnosed. Care plans are not always put in place; health records are often incomplete; the number of times a patient is moved from one ward to another is not monitored; and the environment in the wards is not suited to the needs of patients with dementia.</p><p>The result of those failures is that there will be elderly patients who, during their stay in hospital, will feel confused, frightened and isolated, which culminates in, as described earlier by Jackie Baillie, a loss of dignity to them as individuals, upset to their families and great reputational risk to the national health service. Those patients will not only feel a sense of helplessness, but be put at risk. The Royal College of Physicians has warned that the 1,600 patients with dementia who are in Scotland&#8217;s hospitals at any one time are &#8220;highly vulnerable&#8221; and at higher risk of death while in hospital.</p><p>Now that I have covered some of the issues and concerns that have been raised by the reports, I will say a few words about the role of the health boards and Healthcare Improvement Scotland. Health boards need to understand the reasons for the poor level of care that has been identified by HIS, to ensure that they develop action plans that fully address the problems. However, at this time, I do not have full confidence that that is happening. HIS recently confirmed to me that it does not ask the health boards to examine the reasons for the inappropriate care that has been identified. Furthermore, HIS does not appear to monitor the action plans produced by the health boards. Moreover, it does not have the power to enforce action if the boards are failing to meet their own standards. It also appears that HIS does not have to validate the claims in the health boards&#8217; self-assessments.</p><p>I could go on and on.

Omar is an intelligent young man with his life and career ahead of him. He graduated a couple of years ago with a masters degree in human resources management and is currently looking for work. Employers take note.</p><p>Omar Haq has cerebral palsy and he spoke eloquently to the Health and Sport Committee during its stage 1 consideration of the bill about the positive impact that access to self-directed support has had on his life. The bill has four options for self-directed support, one of which is the use of direct payments to employ a personal assistant. That is what Omar does. He described his personal assistant as fulfilling a personal need by enabling him to go about his day-to-day activities, including travelling on a bus and filling out application forms. Ultimately, the flexibility that is offered by direct payments enables Omar to take more control over not just his care but his life. It raises his ambition to what is possible and drives him on to greater levels of independence. That striving for independent living is at the heart of the aims of the bill.</p><p>The committee received compelling evidence from Pam Duncan of the independent living in Scotland project that we should not be too focused on the process of self-directed support as an end in itself; instead, we were urged to look at its ability to empower those who use it to lead independent lives so that they may participate in society and live a full and ordinary life. As in Omar Haq&#8217;s case, it is not just the system of support that is important but what the system enables people to achieve. The committee believes that the core principle of independent living should be more explicit in the bill. I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to explore the possibility of such an amendment.</p><p>There are high expectations that the bill will bring greater freedom, choice, dignity and indeed control for people like Omar Haq, who require social care to maintain a quality of life and fulfil their potential. However, in the course of our scrutiny, the committee heard the changes that will be required of local authorities and independent and voluntary sector providers to ensure the success of the policy described as dramatic, wide ranging and difficult in every area. We heard evidence from practitioners about the individual, rather than collective files that will need to be kept. The changes were described as &#8220;seismic&#8221;.</p><p>Local authorities seem to be in a variety of states of readiness. Some are further down the line than others in areas such as decommissioning group services, creating individual budgets around packages and embedding the concept of self-directed support in their assessment and care management processes. Concerns were raised with the committee about the approach of some councils to implementing self-directed support, and the impact of that on service users. The issue appears to get very complex at that level, although the problems are no less for that.</p><p>We drilled down below the usual suspects as we took evidence. We found invaluable the insight that was provided by service users and carers at discussion sessions co-ordinated by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and the independent living in Scotland project. Strong views were expressed by individuals about the implementation of self-directed support alongside reassessment processes in Glasgow. Bob Doris touched on that. That negativity was put into context by service users who had been on the receiving end of cuts to their budgets. For them, self-directed support had got off to a bad start and was not an empowering process.</p><p>Self-directed support cannot be seen as camouflage for cuts&#8212;I was pleased to hear the minister recognise that. The perception of the bill is important in terms of poisoning the process at an early stage. If things seem to be imposed on people, the bill could be seen as having a cuts agenda&#8212;that denies the opportunities that the bill would offer people.</p><p>The Scottish Government must ensure that the system is robust and that service users are offered a package that meets their needs. I understand that officials are working with COSLA to assess whether there is merit in establishing a national threshold for access to formal support. Perhaps the minister can say something about that later.</p><p>The committee believes that the statutory complaints procedure is inappropriate for dealing with disputes that arise regarding an individual&#8217;s social care assessment . As the Law Society of Scotland told the committee:</p><p>&#8220;An appeals procedure is about saying that we think that something has not gone right and asking where we want to get to and what we want to put in place. Complaints procedures tend to be backwards looking&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 15 May 2012; c 2269.]</p><p>and focused on apportioning blame.</p><p>Local authorities need to make a clear distinction between complaints and appeals. The committee urges the forthcoming Scottish Government working group on social work complaints procedures to endorse the need for such a distinction. I heard the minister&#8217;s comments earlier that that work is going on.</p><p>As well as focusing on service users, the committee&#8217;s scrutiny took into account the views of unpaid carers, because without Scotland&#8217;s army of unpaid carers our health and social care system would grind to a halt. They play a vital role in the provision of care in Scotland. We heard first hand from carers of their desire for the proposed discretionary power to become a duty on local authorities to provide support following an assessment.</p><p>Florence Burke of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers suggested:</p><p>&#8220;Potentially, a small investment for carers ... who want to take up self-directed support in their own right&#8221;</p><p>could go a long way. She told us that it could even</p><p>&#8220;help to maintain the &#163;10 billion savings to the public purse that carers provide by giving unpaid support.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 22 May 2012; c 2325.]</p><p>The committee recognises that it is vital that carers are given support to protect their physical and mental wellbeing. The bill should underline that most moral of imperatives.</p><p>Another key strand is the cost of the bill&#8217;s implementation, particularly at a time of reduced budgets. There is a major discrepancy in the estimates of how much the bill will cost to implement, with COSLA estimating that it could cost double the amount claimed by the Scottish Government. That difference is so great that it cannot be explained simply as the result of different methodologies. COSLA&#8217;s failure to share with the committee the details of individual cost estimates by local authorities is unacceptable&#8212;it is not acceptable for it to come to a committee and not be prepared to back up its argument, because the committee cannot determine whether the funding gap that was identified is real or imaginary.</p><p>I am keen to seek assurances that there are sufficient resources to ensure that the bill can be implemented effectively. I look forward to hearing further updates from the minister on the on-going discussions that he described. Seriously, those discussions need to be out in the open&#8212;this is not something for back rooms. The committees exist to enable such open discussion.</p><p>The bill holds challenges for service users and service providers alike. However, the committee believes that legislating on the policy of self-directed support should ensure uptake and promote greater consistency of approach across local authorities.

However, as the subject is the rights of victims, I will follow Mark McDonald&#8217;s lead and discuss the stories and experiences of constituents who have come to me because, as victims, they have felt let down by the justice system.</p><p>A woman came to me who had suffered domestic abuse, harassment and violence for many years at the hands of her former partner. He appeared in court but was let off by the sheriff with the warning that, if stitches had been required following the latest assault, he would have gone to prison. Within months, he was back in court. He had gone to her house and stabbed her, as a result of which she required an emergency procedure and hospitalisation. The stabbing also took place in front of an infant. Despite the brutality of the attack, however, he did not receive a custodial sentence. Given that the woman&#8217;s previous experience was of another sheriff saying that if she had required hospitalisation he would have gone to prison, she was amazed that the process could lead to such an outcome.</p><p>My constituent made representations and we spoke to the procurator fiscal. We argued that the decision was unduly lenient. Most people are not aware that there is an appeal process that can be followed by the Crown if it believes that a decision is unduly lenient, but the time in which such discussions can take place is very constrained. My constituent has appealed, but how long the appeal will take and whether it will be successful is another test for the courts.</p><p>We all know that people who have been convicted of serious crimes have the right to appeal&#8212;we frequently read about such cases&#8212;and that some appeals are dealt with relatively quickly. I ask the cabinet secretary whether the consultation will address the imbalance in the system, and whether he will ensure that victims are not passive participants in the process, as he suggested, and are made aware of their right to make representations to the fiscal and the court if they think that there has been undue leniency.</p><p>Another constituent, who raised his head above the parapet after witnessing a murder, has been badly let down. After giving his witness statement in court, he and his family were subjected to systematic intimidation. In direct breach of their bail conditions, the accused would stand outside my constituent&#8217;s house, looking into the property, threatening physical violence and threatening to petrol bomb the home.</p><p>Despite the threats of physical violence&#8212;which are hard to prove, of course&#8212;and the fear and anxiety that they caused the witness and his family, the court did not enforce the bail conditions. That surprised my constituent, given that the police had thought it necessary to install a panic button in their home. That is another example of the disconnect between services that Mark McDonald mentioned. Such inconsistency does much to affect people&#8217;s confidence in coming forward as witnesses to less serious crimes.</p><p>I could go on, but this will be my final story from my constituency. Many members will be familiar with John Muir, who campaigned for tougher sentences for people who are convicted of knife crime. His son Damian was stabbed to death in Greenock nearly five years ago by someone who had numerous convictions and who had been let out on bail but had breached the bail conditions. I am sad to say that in my 13 years as an MSP that is not the only murder case that I have come across involving a perpetrator who was out on bail. There is an issue there.</p><p>I know that it is difficult to address such issues&#8212;if it was easy we would have sorted them&#8212;but I wanted to talk about the issues that victims have raised with me and about the inconsistencies in the system. The responses from the justice system cause confusion and uncertainty and sometimes add insult to injury, compounding the trouble that victims face. What is more, such inconsistency undermines people&#8217;s faith in the justice system. People lose faith and stop reporting crimes, and criminals go free as a result.</p><p>I welcome a number of the aims in the Government&#8217;s consultation paper, such as improving the information that is available to victims and witnesses about the cases that affect them, involving victims more in the judicial process and giving victims the opportunity to make oral representations to the Parole Board. I also support the principle of</p><p>&#8220;Requiring the courts to consider compensation in every case where a victim has suffered injury, loss or distress&#8221;,</p><p>although I heard what Christine Grahame said about the practical problems in that regard.</p><p>I also take the point about how such an approach might relate to the criminal injuries compensation scheme. However, there are anomalies in the scheme. If someone has the misfortune to suffer a serious assault, as another of my constituents did, the loss of earnings for the first 28 weeks is discounted and is not compensated for. For a low-paid worker who has a temporary contract at Amazon, the financial impact is immediate, whereas someone who works in the public sector will not have the same concerns during that period, because under their contract they are normally provided with help.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Improving Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This has been an interesting debate, and it has been interesting to listen to the expert views of many solicitors who have participated in it: the majority of members who have spoken up to now are or were legal practitioners.

When change is not part of the culture, as in this institution, it is often difficult to create the necessary change. Thankfully, we had the consultative steering group, which has been mentioned. Henry McLeish, the late Campbell Christie, Joyce McMillan, George Reid and Jim Wallace among others foresaw the need for on-going change in the Parliament, and they recommended that there should be self-assessment, monitoring and a taking stock of our policy and performance on an annual basis, set against the principles of power sharing, access, participation and equal opportunities.</p><p>I welcome the committee&#8217;s work: although the changes have been long in coming, that is no reflection on the work of the current committee. I look forward to its on-going work, which has particular relevance for the business of the committees.</p><p>The consultative steering group envisaged powerful committees that would ensure that our Parliament would not simply focus on debates in the chamber. The committees would have powers and responsibilities to initiate legislation, scrutinise the Government of the day, conduct inquiries and play a pre-legislative role in the development of policy. By any assessment&#8212;self-assessment, monitoring or taking stock&#8212;and balancing the results against the principles of the Parliament, the committees are sadly unable to meet that expectation.</p><p>Why has that happened? Perhaps the expectations were too high. In our desire to be different from Westminster, we created committees with both standing and select functions, but we have been more successful in the area of scrutinising legislation than we have been on policy development. Perhaps the steering group was too optimistic in the degree and level of cross-party co-operation that it expected to take place.</p><p>There are other practical intrusions such as the loss of institutional knowledge&#8212;which is sometimes referred to as churn&#8212;when the members of committees change, which does not add to the strength of those committees in some instances. There is limited time in which committees can be independent and proactive, and set work programmes with those who have an interest in them.</p><p>We have lost out institutionally to an Executive, to its desire and drive, and to its policy and manifesto. None of those is a crime in itself, but I am suggesting that there are imperatives in that regard that work against the stature of our committees. Political parties are reluctant to share power on policy&#8212;indeed, they think that only they should be developing policy.</p><p>Given the focus on the chamber and the set-piece debates, the Parliamentary Bureau, with its need to get the job done in the squeeze of time, impacts on committees and what they are able to do. The SPCB, with all its responsibilities to run the Parliament efficiently, naturally works with those powers in the Parliament to achieve that aim. It is clear that the 15 committees of this Parliament are no match for that collective, but that situation has led to an unequal balance of power within the institution, which was clearly not the consultative steering group&#8217;s intention.</p><p>The committees have been passive in that process, which has happened over a period of time. They now reflect the majority in the Parliament, which is an added complication that we need to examine. The system was never designed for a Government with a majority, but the process has been happening over time. Committee members and conveners have been too passive and too willing to accept the pressure of time; too willing to toe the party line; too slow to accept innovation and change in the committees; and too ready to discuss issues in private rather than in public.</p><p>I say that as someone who has some understanding of all the committees. I have been a whip in the Parliament, so I have had responsibility for ensuring that others toed the party line. I served two terms on the SPCB, I am currently serving my second term as a convener of a committee in the Parliament and I have served on the Parliamentary Bureau. I am therefore complicit in the process, but I am afraid that our committees have lost out.</p><p>Many of those issues have been recognised, and the Presiding Officer recognises them too. Many solutions have been discussed, but although they may improve the situation in the short term, we now need to ask the hard questions about whether we as parliamentarians want to fulfil our ambitions for our committees.</p><p>I now&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22668583", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Parliamentary Reform (Changes to Standing Orders)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on parliamentary reform.

Alcohol Focus Scotland told us:</p><p>&#8220;It is very easy to point at young people and say how antisocial and irresponsible their drinking behaviour is, but all they are doing is reflecting the adult society that they see ... an environment that promotes access and excess and which saturates them in images of alcohol&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 10 January 2012; c 760.]</p><p>That Scotland&#8217;s relationship with alcohol can rightly be described as unhealthy, damaging, problematic and dysfunctional is beyond question. The Health and Sport Committee is not alone in that conviction. Along with the Scottish Government, the medical profession, academia, the police, children&#8217;s charities, the drinks industry, retailers, civic society, media commentators and others, the committee believes that we must act to counter the generational harm that is caused by drink, for our misuse and abuse of alcohol are problems that not just merit our attention but demand our remedy.</p><p>Some people consider minimum pricing to be an integral part of that remedial action, while others are not so readily persuaded. The committee agrees that a range of initiatives must be pursued, from awareness-raising campaigns for young people and parents to interventions with individuals and packages of intense support. We believe that such a multifaceted approach is essential if we are to challenge and overcome Scotland&#8217;s booze culture.</p><p>A majority of the committee&#8212;boosted by one since last Thursday, or so it would appear&#8212;is persuaded by the assertion that the bill will help to reduce alcohol consumption. The members in that majority considered the evidence we heard to be overwhelming and compelling. In their view, minimum pricing can cut alcohol consumption by harmful drinkers and reduce the impact of alcohol misuse on public health, crime, productivity and the economy. Professor Stockwell told the committee:</p><p>&#8220;You will be doing something that&#8212;from the scientific point of view&#8212;will without a shred of doubt save lives, reduce healthcare costs, prevent death and injury on the roads, prevent birth defects, and reduce public violence&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 10 January 2012; c 786.]</p><p>That majority believes the bill to be a significant contribution to the package of measures that is necessary to curtail Scotland&#8217;s dangerous affinity with alcohol.</p><p>A minority of the committee remains sceptical but is hopeful that the health and social benefits suggested by the Scottish Government may transpire. Some are still unconvinced by the ability of minimum pricing to produce the desired result, and they believe that a universal approach could have an unfair impact on moderate drinkers and those on lower incomes.</p><p>Among other concerns is the market response&#8212;&#8220;the big unknown&#8221;, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies puts it. It was not covered by either the Sheffield modelling or the evidence from Canada. We simply do not know how producers or retailers will react to minimum pricing, nor do we know the extent to which profits will be accrued from the policy by some businesses. As the Centre for Economics and Business Research told us:</p><p>&#8220;The retailers stand to make windfall profits at the expense of poor consumers&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Health and Sport Committee, 10 January 2012; c 742.]</p><p>The question of legality in a European context is also an issue in the minority view. Much depends on the level at which the cabinet secretary decides to set the price and on the balance struck between market intervention and health benefits. I welcome her letter to me last week stating that she intends to notify the order setting a minimum price to the European Union. I shall file the correspondence under &#8220;P&#8221; for progress. The cabinet secretary&#8217;s recent pronouncement on the merits of a sunset clause was similarly encouraging, and the committee will no doubt consider that matter at stage 2.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

We speak as one in stating that Scotland&#8217;s relationship with drink must change. A number of committee witnesses spoke about the link between social deprivation and drink and substance abuse.

When life becomes a daily struggle, as it does for many, drinking can be seen as a coping mechanism in dire circumstances. This is a complex social and cultural problem, and all of us on the committee recognise the need for a range of actions.</p><p>We acknowledge the public health motivations behind the bill and endorse the wider programme for tackling alcohol misuse detailed in the Scottish Government&#8217;s framework for action. Certainly, what the committee heard in evidence, opinion and argument&#8212;a good deal of it alarming, most of it cogent and not all of it consensual&#8212;made clear that the time has come to throw off the stereotype of the drink-sodden Scot, to embrace the word &#8220;moderation&#8221; without fear of ridicule and to work towards the goal of a healthier and happier society.</p><p>Our stage 1 report details the committee&#8217;s consideration of the bill and sets out our conclusions and recommendations. I hope that it will also provide a solid contribution to the work that lies ahead to achieve the desired goal. There may be differences of opinion on the policy, but supporters and sceptics alike welcome further debate. We look forward to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s decision before stage 3 on the level at which she will set the minimum price.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I regret the intervention and the inference that I am not responding correctly or appropriately to the committee&#8217;s report.

We wanted to ensure that the system was fit for purpose and that it was delivering the appropriate scrutiny of and improvement in all our care for the elderly.</p><p>The inquiry was the committee&#8217;s first of the parliamentary session. I thank the 51 organisations that submitted evidence to the inquiry, the clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre and, in particular, the service users and carers whom we met on our fact-finding visits.</p><p>The committee&#8217;s report is a consensual one, and it is all the stronger for that. It enables us to provide the Government with a clear steer on areas for improvement in the regulatory system, because although we found the system to be sufficiently rigorous to identify care services for older people that are failing to deliver high-quality care, there are some areas that the Government needs to address. I will cover those that relate to inspections of care services by Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland&#8212;the care inspectorate&#8212;complaints, the national care standards, the workforce, and commissioning and procurement practices. I am sure that other members of the committee will pick up other subjects.</p><p>A key issue that was raised right at the start of the inquiry was the proposed reduction in the frequency of inspections of care homes conducted by the care inspectorate. That was criticised, and we were pleased that the committee&#8217;s inquiry prompted the Government to address that concern by increasing the frequency of inspections.</p><p>Inspections are conducted against four grade themes, but not all the themes are covered in each inspection. That approach was criticised by Age Scotland, which felt that each theme should be assessed as part of a &#8220;whole care service review&#8221; whenever an inspection was conducted.</p><p>There seems to be some contradiction between the Scottish Government and the care inspectorate on the issue of inspecting against the four themes. The Government states that the care inspectorate is assessing whether efficiency savings can be made and resources redirected to inspecting all four themes in all inspections. However, in its response, the care inspectorate states that that will not happen and that although all four themes will be inspected in medium to high-risk assessments, only a sample of 10 per cent of better-performing services will be inspected against all four quality themes. Therefore, the care inspectorate will not provide a blanket approach involving inspection against all the themes in all inspections.</p><p>Does the cabinet secretary believe that, to provide maximum assurance of the quality of care, all four themes should be covered in every inspection? The committee calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the care inspectorate has all the necessary support to fulfil its role.</p><p>We heard evidence that the complaints system should be bolstered by greater support for whistleblowers. Our recommendation is that the care inspectorate should publish guidance for all care staff who wish to raise concerns confidentially. The Government&#8217;s response refers to the Scottish Social Services Council guidance on whistleblowing, but that guidance does not make specific reference to the whistleblower&#8217;s confidentiality being protected. I therefore seek the cabinet secretary&#8217;s views on confidentiality as it relates to whistleblowing.</p><p>Another key recommendation of our report called on the Government to conduct a review of the national care standards. I am pleased that the Government has accepted our recommendation by announcing that it will conduct a review of those standards, but I ask it to tell us when that review will get under way.</p><p>The committee felt that, as well as being in need of an update, the national care standards should have equality and human rights issues at their very heart. The Scottish Human Rights Commission has told me that it believes that the care inspectorate should be encouraged to develop its understanding of human rights standards as they apply in care settings.</p><p>Those are not simply dry words. They include, for instance, the right to be free from unintended or careless neglect; the right to be protected from pharmaceutical or medical abuse; the right to live as independently as possible; respect for privacy; and the right to modesty when dressing and bathing.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s response to our report made no explicit reference to human rights, and I am keen to hear an assurance from the cabinet secretary that human rights will be embedded in the national care standards. That can only help to improve people&#8217;s understanding of how those rights can be delivered in practice.</p><p>Another area that the committee considered was the care workforce. Its members are vital to ensuring that our care services are of the highest quality, but for many years, the social care workforce has been undervalued and often poorly paid, poorly treated and poorly trained. Its members must be registered, invested in and paid at least the living wage.</p><p>We heard from Lord Sutherland during our evidence sessions that there were instances in Edinburgh in which care home staff had left their jobs during the summer to take on casual jobs at the Edinburgh festival because those jobs were better paid. What does that say about the value that we place on the social care workforce?</p><p>Good commissioning and procurement practices go hand in hand in determining the quality of care that is delivered by a care service. The committee supports the view of the Coalition of Care and Support Providers in Scotland&#8212;CCPS&#8212;that the care inspectorate has &#8220;far fewer teeth&#8221; to challenge commissioning practice in comparison with its powers of intervention in service delivery.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s response is at odds with that view. The CCPS has reiterated its position on the issue, and it points to a number of issues to support its view. First, there are no national standards for commissioning and procurement against which to assess an authority&#8217;s performance. Secondly, there is no minimum frequency of inspection of those functions. Thirdly, there are no provisions under which the care inspectorate can issue improvement or condition notices for poor practice in commissioning.</p><p>In addition to the CCPS&#8217;s comments, &#8220;Commissioning social care&#8221;, which Audit Scotland published last week, states:</p><p>&#8220;Councils ... have been slow to develop strategic commissioning. Only 11 of the 32 council areas had commissioning strategies covering all social care services.&#8221;</p><p>It also notes that</p><p>&#8220;there is a risk that councils focus too much on reducing costs when procuring services and give insufficient regard to the range and quality of services and their impact on individuals.&#8221;</p><p>Given the CCPS&#8217;s position and the Audit Scotland report, will the Government explore further the merit in extending the care inspectorate&#8217;s powers in that area?</p><p>I am sure that I speak for all my colleagues on the committee when I say that I do not view this debate as the end of our work on the issue. Our current inquiry into the integration of health and social care services will doubtless raise issues about the assessment and monitoring of different services. We will also explore in further detail the provision of care-at-home services during our forthcoming scrutiny of the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>I believe that we all recognise that the commitment to elderly care has been promoted across Governments, across parties and across the Parliament. We must maintain that commitment and never lose sight of the fact that dignity, compassion and kindness should always be at the heart of care for the elderly. I believe that our inquiry has been about doing just that.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s 3rd Report, 2011 (Session 4): Report on Inquiry into the Regulation of Care for Older People (SP Paper 40).</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662481", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulation of Care for Older People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Today we are to debate&#8212;not for the first time, nor, I suspect, the last&#8212;the age-old question of how we care for the elderly.

My experience is that the work ethic is strong in my constituency. In welfare reform, we are not talking about simply forcing people back into work and people chasing jobs that no longer exist. I accept that work is the best route out of poverty and that it has a higher value than does simple provision of an income, but I meet people who are in work in my constituency who are struggling with the system. Some of them have more than one job. They have part-time or temporary work and are not clear of poverty. Their children will suffer and the proposals will, of course, make their plight even more difficult.</p><p>We cannot answer questions against that backdrop of fear and apprehension. As a constituency MSP, I am unable to answer questions from kinship carers and from people who receive council tax benefit about how they will end up, and I am unable to confirm whether free school meals will continue. That is the case for all members in our constituencies.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee began its work informally over the summer. Many of us engaged with campaigning groups outwith the Parliament and listened to their concerns, and that work progressed to the committee inquiry later in the year, the report on which we have completed. I thank everyone who participated in the process, including our clerks. We gave ourselves increased time to ensure appropriate scrutiny by the committee. Members of the committee did not always appreciate the all-day sessions, but they stuck with it and were determined to give views a hearing.</p><p>We heard evidence from the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, the Poverty Alliance, Citizens Advice Scotland, Action for Children Scotland, Children 1st, One Parent Families Scotland, Inclusion Scotland, Capability Scotland and SAMH, all of which brought us stories of fear and apprehension. It was clear that they did not know how things would work out.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were not able to get a minister from the Department for Work and Pensions, and we expressed regret about that. We believed that it was important to have a UK Government minister at the committee, but it was decided that one would not be sent, and officials were sent instead. I thought that it would have been important to the UK ministers to come to the Scottish Parliament to defend the policy and the implications that it might have for many of our most vulnerable people. It would also have been interesting to get some insight into the discussions and negotiations that were taking place between the Scottish Government and the UK Government, but we were unable to get that.</p><p>Much of what we concluded has been put on the record today. We concluded that</p><p>&#8220;the legislative consent memorandum did not contain a draft motion, but rather set out in detail the five areas of the Bill, as it stands now, which would require consent from the Scottish Parliament.&#8221;</p><p>We said that the committee was clear&#8212;as, I am sure, Parliament is&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;that voting against a motion which seeks legislative consent for the provisions of the Bill which fall within the competence of the Scottish Parliament would not prevent the Welfare Reform Bill from completing its passage at Westminster and receiving Royal Assent.&#8221;</p><p>The committee considered that</p><p>&#8220;in respect of the provisions regarding data sharing and industrial injuries disablement benefit there is little controversy and consent should be given.</p><p>However, the Committee has heard from witnesses many strong criticisms&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>how could we ignore them?&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;about the changes &#8230; proposed in the Welfare Reform Bill. These legitimate concerns centre on the proposals for Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payments. The Committee acknowledges that many of these concerns arise from a lack of detailed information but, nevertheless, believes that they cannot simply be ignored. It is appropriate for the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise these changes, particularly where they will impact directly on areas of devolved policy.</p><p>The Committee notes that an alternative to giving consent in relation to Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payments would be for the Scottish Government to introduce a Bill to the Scottish Parliament. The Committee considers that this approach may be preferable as it would allow the Scottish Parliament time to consider more fully the implications of the forthcoming welfare reforms and the appropriate Scottish policy response to them. However, the Committee is uncertain whether&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>and, obviously, it looks for reassurance that&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;such a Scottish Bill could be drafted, scrutinised and passed by the Parliament in sufficient time to ensure that the Scottish statute book reflects the changes introduced by the Welfare Reform Bill prior to their implementation. The Committee therefore invites the Scottish Government to consider whether this is a practical alternative to allowing the UK Parliament to legislate on behalf of Scotland in these areas and to report its view to the Parliament.&#8221;</p><p>We accept that that is unprecedented. It is the first time that a committee has recommended that course of action and we did not take that decision lightly. We reached that conclusion after a lot of consideration and really serious and impressive evidence.</p><p>I commend the report to Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657862", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I deal with the committee&#8217;s response, I should do the political broadcast and say that I appreciate the opportunity to record our thanks to the people who participated in the work of the committee.

It must be recognised that the Government is trying to address an imposing and complicated problem. I believe that it is an extremely worthwhile cause.</p><p>Jackie Baillie referred to cost-shunting issues, as did the cabinet secretary earlier this week. As Jackie Baillie described it, there is pass the parcel between the national health service and local authorities. That is a good example of a serious failure of the current separated system, which all too often leaves elderly people with the short end of the stick.</p><p>Delaying elderly people in hospital beds at a cost of &#163;2,000 a week when residential and nursing home services can cost a fraction of that is not only a blatant waste of funds but offensive to the high standards to which we hold our health service.</p><p>The integration of health and social care is a way in which to spend precious funding more effectively, and it should also be a way in which to provide higher-quality services to the elderly. As I said, it is an extremely worthwhile cause, but we all understand that it is not a cure-all for the issues that face the health and social care system as it applies to the elderly.</p><p>In 2002, the Parliament made the bold decision to provide free personal care for the elderly men and women of Scotland, and for nearly 10 years the Scottish Government, in one way or another, has paid the health and social care bills for nearly every Scot over the age of 65. However, as has been mentioned, much has changed in those 10 years. Scotland&#8217;s demographic has been ageing and the cost of providing people with that healthcare has nearly doubled to a staggering &#163;370&#160;million a year. At the same time, we have seen the economy crumble around us. Budgets across the board are on the chopping block and the personal care funding gap has grown to about &#163;40&#160;million a year.</p><p>So far, the Scottish Government has stepped in to plug the gap, but the reality of Scotland&#8217;s ageing population and the Government&#8217;s diminishing funds in these difficult economic times have put the sustainability of the system under question. Experts challenge us with warnings to Government. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the independent budget review group, the Association of Directors of Social Work, the Centre for Public Policy for Regions and Lord Sutherland, who was the architect of free personal care, have all called into question the sustainability of the policy. Against that stark backdrop, those of us who support affordable, good-quality care for the elderly recognise that progress must be made and that the status quo is not an option. We also recognise that the integration of budgets is a step in a long but necessary journey, but that is not the only area in which we need integration in order to improve services.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee recently produced our &#8220;Report on Inquiry into the Regulation of Care for Older People&#8221;, in which we welcome moves towards greater integration of health and social care, and with it, the integration of the regulatory regimes that oversee those services. In recommending a review of the national care standards, we believe that there is an opportunity to include</p><p>&#8220;the introduction of joint inspections of care pathways&#8221;,</p><p>which Bob Doris mentioned,</p><p>&#8220;including clinical care in the community and the inspection of social care for older people in ... acute services.&#8221;</p><p>The committee also recommends that the Scottish Government should consider establishing</p><p>&#8220;a single point of entry&#8221;</p><p>into the complaints procedure,</p><p>&#8220;with a view to greater integration in future.&#8221;</p><p>We all want to ensure the best outcomes for elderly people, but the integration and securing of care will be easier said than done. That is the challenge that the policy presents. However, I am sure that I speak for all members of the Health and Sport Committee when I say that we look forward to working with the Scottish Government to make progress in this challenging area and, through that, to keeping our focus on improving care for our elderly people in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Integration of Health and Social Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Those who usually come to the chamber on a Thursday morning for a Donnybrook will be disappointed this morning, because there is a great deal of consensus.

It is sad for my constituency and I hope that he does not come to regret it.</p><p>The consensus in the debate gives me an opportunity to highlight, despite its disappointing outcome, some positives from the campaign, which I hope has not ended this week. We should never have had to fight the campaign, never mind lose it. The workers at Clyde coastguard centre are proud of their work, the knowledge and skills that they have acquired and the lives that they have saved. They have approached the adversity with great dignity. Although 31 jobs are under threat, that has never been at the centre of the workers&#8217; campaign. They are committed to their work and to what they have achieved over the years.</p><p>Stuart Atkinson, who is the PCS members&#8217; rep at the Navy buildings on Eldon Street in Greenock, has presented a compelling and forensic case for retaining the Clyde coastguard and has exposed many of the myths and the political posturing that are at the decision&#8217;s heart. I am sad that it took the threat of closure before many people realised the importance and range of the work that the coastguard service does. The workers have got on with that quietly for many years and have delivered consistently. They have not looked for medals and have done a wonderful job.</p><p>Another positive is that the campaign has brought together levels of government&#8212;the Scottish Government and local authorities&#8212;and has gone across party-political divisions and local authority boundaries and rivalries. A year ago in the Parliament, I was pleased to gain the First Minister&#8217;s support for the campaign. He made good on that. At my request, he met the campaigners at Bute House earlier this year, prior to the Scottish Government&#8217;s response to the UK Government being submitted.</p><p>A year ago, when the announcement was made and we had a debate in the Parliament, I feared that it was already a done deal. Despite the compelling case that has been made, that has come to pass. Local knowledge has been dismissed. We have arrived at a decision that will ensure that traffic on the west coast of Scotland is managed outside Scotland&#8212;traffic that includes significant cargo traffic, MOD traffic, including nuclear submarines, 30 cruise liners a year with a large number of passengers, and significant ferry traffic with more than 4 million passengers, in waters whose dangers were vividly described by Mike MacKenzie.</p><p>The decision undoubtedly increases the potential for human, environmental&#8212;and, for Mr Penning and his Government, political&#8212;disaster. We now move to a new stage of the campaign&#8212;that of vigilance. Closure cannot be rushed; it cannot be taken forward&#8212;or taken for granted&#8212;without robust testing of the proposed network. The commitment to that has to be more significant and honest than the commitment to an open and transparent consultation, which we do not believe that we have had. I hope that the Scottish Government will continue to work with the PCS members, the coastal communities and the wider emergency services to ensure that those networks are tested robustly and that the UK Government thinks again before it puts our coastal waters and the people who use them at further risk.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655473", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Maritime Safety and Coastguards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The consensus in the debate is welcome, but it is a bit disconcerting, because it makes it hard to find something to argue about or to say something that has not been mentioned already.

However, the real result has been the dashing of expectation and ambition in communities, wasted talent and destroyed communities.</p><p>Adam Ingram mentioned some figures. Over the years, many quick fixes have been tried in an effort to replace the large number of jobs lost from the shipyards and the engine works. We have learned over time that we cannot simply reverse the decline by replacing industries with something that is not sustainable. We cannot put a Band-aid on a problem that has been caused by years of neglect and decline.</p><p>The sunrise industries were a classic example. Electronic manufacturing took up a lot of the slack in places such as Inverclyde and North Ayrshire. Employment in such manufacturing was plentiful but, of course, it was low paid, there was increased casualisation and the legacy, because we did not get the cycle right, is empty factories.</p><p>During that process, we created a new class of people who are known as the working poor&#8212;those who work for what is now the minimum wage and who cannot provide for their families without state aid. The quick fixes involved big announcements followed by even bigger disappointments. We had the failure of the enterprise zones and the failure of Government and the enterprise agencies to work together. Ambitious community plans were left to gather dust and we could not move on because of disputes about planning and who owned land.</p><p>At times during that period, the challenges that we faced in Inverclyde appeared to be almost insurmountable, and it seemed that we could not move on at all. However, at last, we moved on from the quick fixes. They were replaced with a longer-term model&#8212;the urban regeneration company, which has a tight focus on the community and is tasked to work across it. The URC model is long term and recognises that we need to invest not just in business, but in the community. Thanks to the URC Riverside Inverclyde, those advances have come to the Inverclyde area. The changes are there for everybody to see. There are new businesses and there has been wider investment in colleges, housing and new schools, which I believe is the result of the thinking and ambition in the URC.</p><p>Many members were in Inverclyde during the recent by-election and were confronted by the new Inverclyde and what has been achieved. It might have been a backhanded compliment, but many members took me aside in the Parliament to tell me about the changes that they had noticed, which were not what they had expected. A transformation has taken place.</p><p>I cannot argue with the overall thinking in the strategy and the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments, although I suppose that the devil will be in the detail. The benefit of that type of thinking in the URC and of its can-do attitude reaches far beyond the obvious physical improvements in facilities and infrastructure. Riverside Inverclyde has become a catalyst for change in the area and an infectious model for action that has been picked up by other agencies in the Inverclyde community, resulting in changes in schools and housing.</p><p>With the necessary support, Riverside Inverclyde can offer much more, such as the development of the famous sugar sheds and the James Watt dock area. Recently, the popular television drama &#8220;Waterloo Road&#8221; relocated to Inverclyde. That can be part of how we promote the identity of Greenock and Inverclyde.</p><p>Members would not expect me to say anything else but, sadly, we are fearful that that progress is under threat because of the deep cuts to the URC. The cuts to Inverclyde&#8217;s regeneration funding have been serious and we are worried that they put a question mark over the continuation of the steady progress that has been made. How can we expect long-term results when a crucial 10-year project is to be abandoned halfway through? How can the URC make good on its commitment to those deprived communities when the Government cannot even make good on its commitment to the urban regeneration companies? How do we look forward and commit to a new strategy, which needs to be long term, when our experience is that commitments are not being seen through?</p><p>My challenge to the Scottish Government and the cabinet secretary is to make good on the commitment to regeneration and to back a wider manifesto for the regeneration of Inverclyde. Our ambitions have increased. I say clearly to the Scottish Government that it must keep its side of the bargain and allow Riverside Inverclyde to see through its long-term plans by making good on previous commitments and ending the uncertainty about future funding.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654773", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am also pleased to be able to take part in the debate and I welcome the minister&#8217;s comments about focusing on the hard-pressed communities that are less resilient to the recession and downturn that we face.

I see members shaking their heads, but the experience was horrible.

However, as Stuart McMillan pointed out, I was a bit cynical and suspicious about the nature of the debate, given that we have had lots of opportunity to discuss the issue in a united way across the parties in the Parliament. I was delighted to take the opportunity to seek and receive the First Minister&#8217;s support on the issue at First Minister&#8217;s questions some time ago, and of course Alasdair Allan&#8217;s very good members&#8217; business debate on the issue was well attended, which clearly sent the message that the Parliament was united on the issue. I was therefore surprised to see the issue back on the agenda for this debate and was suspicious of the motives. However, I heard what Stuart McMillan said and I am happy with his reassurances that he is not using the response from David MacBrayne and his company as a political tool in the current by-election.</p><p>I make no apology for repeating some of the important issues about the Greenock coastguard station, which is better known as the navy buildings after the buildings that house the station. There are a wealth of experts in that station who are available to assist in times of difficulty. In these times, it is rare to find such a facility under one roof, and that needs to be recognised. It should not be given up easily. Some people would say that that type of capability should be the norm. I was glad to read&#8212;I will return to this&#8212;that the Transport Committee at Westminster is considering a radical rethink of the matter.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the Clyde coastguard manages Ministry of Defence traffic, including nuclear submarines. It also deals with significant cargo traffic at the Clydeport container terminal and manages the more than 30 cruise liners that arrive in Greenock every year, which each carry in excess of 1,500 passengers. The Clyde coastguard also covers ferry routes as far south as Arran and as far north as Mull, with estimated annual passenger numbers of 4 million to 5 million. The potential for human, environmental and political disaster is obvious. I hope that some of the political disaster can be avoided.</p><p>It is timely to welcome David MacBrayne&#8217;s submission to the consultation. As Stuart McMillan also recognised, the last piece of work of the late David Cairns MP was supportive of the coastguard station. I hope that submissions such as those from David MacBrayne and David Cairns have influenced the Transport Committee, which came out with its condemnation yesterday. I hope that those submissions were of assistance in its deliberations. The fact that current coastguard personnel were prevented from participating in the so-called consultation makes it even more important that those submissions were received.</p><p>There is no doubt that the Transport Committee at Westminster shares our concerns. The chairman, Louise Ellman, said that there is little support for the proposals and that the committee has no confidence that they would allow the coastguard service to perform as well as, or more effectively than, it performs now. She said that any future reorganisation of the service should be based on 24-hour centres rather than on stations that open only during daylight hours. She also stated:</p><p>&#8220;We accept there is a need for some modernisation, but the government&#8217;s proposals for the future of the coastguard service are seriously flawed.&#8221;</p><p>We agree. The Parliament agrees. There is a lot of U-turning going on just now.

It is necessary to realise that potential, but competition is fierce throughout Europe and, indeed, within the UK. That is our ambition, but we must realise that ambition.</p><p>At this point, I should apologise in advance because, in the previous session of Parliament, some of my colleagues heard my girns and complaints about Inverclyde&#8217;s position in that new market. However, that is my job and, with a new minister in place, I will not miss the opportunity to make the case.</p><p>In the face of the difficult competition that I mentioned, we worked to bring about the national renewables infrastructure plan, which was commissioned by the Scottish energy advisory board. The group was chaired by the First Minister, no less. The work was heavily influenced by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and supported by Scottish Enterprise.</p><p>The report&#8217;s task was to identify sites in Scotland that offered the greatest opportunities for development for use as construction sites. A matrix and weighting were applied to a number of sites in the process of selection for investment, but it is significant that little weighting was given to population. Is it really sensible, sustainable and cost effective to recreate the labour camps that we had with the offshore industry, which involved massive shifts of population and skills from the central belt? People travelled the length of Scotland, created such camps, left them and came back again. Why was no weighting given to population and skills capacity?</p><p>Is it really competitive to spend &#163;20 million or &#163;30 million to bring some sites to the market when we can achieve that objective for around &#163;5 million with a site such as Inchgreen dry dock in Greenock?</p><p>We must also recognise that the matrix included a 25 per cent weighting for proximity and geography. That is surprising. Things have moved on and there are sites up and running on the east coast of Scotland. They are competing in the market and doing work for the west coast of Ireland, so there is no competitive disadvantage. I wonder why that 25 per cent weighting was added to the matrix.</p><p>Those points are not insignificant for my area and constituency, because they lost out very narrowly indeed to those that made the list of preferred sites. The Clyde area, with its population, skills base, deepwater docks and infrastructure, stands to lose out given that it did not make the list. It is difficult to understand why, when the country came together to ensure that the UK Ministry of Defence contract resulted in jobs for the shipyards on the Clyde, a misguided plan proceeded that will diminish the opportunity that those Clyde facilities will have to take part in the renewables manufacturing industry in the future.</p><p>The significant potential of the renewables industry is surely an opportunity for the whole of Scotland. I hope that the Scottish Government will re-examine the matrix and weighting that were applied for the national renewables infrastructure plan to ensure that access to those significant opportunities is not hindered in any way.</p><p>In conclusion, I ask the minister to accept that we need to spread the gain, wealth potential and opportunity across Scotland. We must look again at the national renewables infrastructure plan to ensure that we are promoting effectively and aggressively the best of our physical resources and skills so that we can bring those green jobs to Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The motion, the amendments and the debate are characterised by common themes: a shared ambition to create a sustainable future; a determination to secure the maximum return on our investment and our resources; and a sense of expectancy&#8212;indeed, excitement&#8212;at what can be achieved to grow our economy and create the sustainable jobs of the future, to the benefit of all communities in...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Duncan", "last_name": "McNeil", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80478", "house": "4", "member_id": "80478", "person_id": "14061", "party": "Labour", "constituency": "Greenock and Inverclyde"}, "section_id": "22647891", "hpos": "12", "gid": "2011-06-02.0.11", "epobject_id": "22647902", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2011-06-02.0.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14061+section%3Asp#g0.11", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80478"}, {"body": "<p>I am interested in Hunterston&#8212;we built a power station not far from my constituency.

This is the latest piece of legislation and action by the Parliament and others in response to the difficulties and failures in the 2007 local government and Scottish Parliament elections.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is in complete contrast to the type of debate that we had after the 2007 election. In my constituency, 1,100 people were denied the vote and, in some polling stations, the proportion of spoilt papers was in excess of 10 per cent.</p><p>It might be useful to remind ourselves about some of that debate and the recommendations and actions that flowed from that time. The Gould report has been mentioned, and the Local Government and Communities Committee&#8217;s report of 2008 made recommendations and comments about a range of areas around the Scottish Parliament and local government elections. Many of the issues that gave us concern at that time have been mentioned this morning, such as e-counting, adjudication of ballot papers, the administration and co-ordination of elections in Scotland, and the absence of a parliamentary committee with clear responsibility or a scrutiny role. Many of those issues have been addressed and committees of Parliament will have a scrutiny role in the future. I hope that that role will be used to the full in the evaluation of the 2011 elections and the referendum that we face in a few weeks.</p><p>We addressed the issue of wider engagement in elections. In a good example of the Government of the day working with a committee of the Parliament, we held a major seminar in the chamber to address the challenges of voter turnout and registration.</p><p>Of course, we passed legislation to decouple the local government and Scottish Parliament elections. Also, deadlines for nominations for all elections were brought forward and are now set out in election law. Further changes&#8212;I hope that they are for the good&#8212;are expected in the Scotland Bill.</p><p>Like other members, I believe that the bill is another step in the right direction. It seeks to put in statute much of the good work that the electoral management board has under way on a non-statutory basis. In a recent evidence session, the Local Government and Communities Committee was given a flavour of that. We heard about the introduction of an annual publication of standards for returning officers, which is now in place. That will ensure good standards across Scotland. One consequence of the bill that will be passed today is that that will be extended to local government.</p><p>In its regular planning meetings, the electoral management board has agreed specific preparations and planning arrangements for the May elections. Counting officers and returning officers have submitted risk registers to the chief counting officer. Members will be pleased to know that none of that work indicates a level of risk that should worry us. Working together, parties such as the Electoral Commission and the Government have overseen the serious addressing and testing of the design guidance for voter material and the production of verification and count protocols for people to follow. All that should give help and advice irrespective of where it is needed in Scotland. We also have adjudication booklets and codes of practice on postal voting. Overall, the detailed level of planning and action in the bill gives hope for the future. It should address any lack of confidence in the general population about the election process in Scotland.</p><p>Before we get carried away with all that, I should mention the significant planning challenges that still remain. The UK referendum and the Scottish Parliament elections have different franchises and different rules on what should be counted, and how. That will impact on where the ballot can be counted. There is also the issue of postal voters receiving not one ballot paper on which to mark yes or no or to tick a box, but various coloured ballot papers and a whole range of information. We can only do our best to try to reassure people that they will be guided and supported through the process. I hope that we will be able to achieve that.</p><p>As I mentioned, the nature of the count will be affected. In recent evidence, the Local Government and Communities Committee was told that some declarations could be made between five and six o&#8217;clock in the morning. That made me wonder what the chamber wants by way of an overnight count. When declarations may not be made until five or six o&#8217;clock in the morning, is an overnight count still worth it? We may not be able to do anything about that now, having got to this stage. The various ballot papers have to be sorted out before the count on the Scottish Parliament elections can start. That is a significant challenge.</p><p>We may have an increased number of postal votes. That is not necessarily a bad thing. However, as the Local Government and Communities Committee heard in evidence, personal identifiers are an issue that impacts on the elderly in particular. At the last UK elections, more than 8,000 mainly elderly people in Scotland did not even have their ballot papers opened, perhaps because they got the day that they signed the form mixed up with their date of birth and put their date of birth in the wrong box.</p><p>There are other significant challenges, such as the impact of the Easter holidays and the royal wedding. However, I look forward to voting for the bill as yet another step in ensuring that we address the mistakes of the past, restore confidence in our elections and give voters, candidates and agents as good an election as possible.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646674", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be taking part in the stage 3 debate on the Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Bill.

That period had come to an end, and it was the company&#8217;s intention to move to Newtownards in Northern Ireland to take advantage of a similar grant that would be available there. The management confirmed the closure of the factory to the workforce on 5 February 1981. The response from those workers was swift and direct&#8212;barricading themselves into the factory and preventing stock and machinery worth around &#163;1&#160;million from leaving.</p><p>That response was completely understandable, given the background of the time. Scotland&#8217;s unemployment rate was 13 per cent. In Strathclyde region, it was 17 per cent and, in some areas of Greenock and Port Glasgow, it was as high as 25 per cent. The women had witnessed the effect of that on their communities and families&#8212;their fathers, their brothers and their husbands. Many of the women were the sole earners in their households. They were not working for pin money.</p><p>The women&#8217;s first task, of course, was to inform those families that they would not be home that night&#8212;no easy task before the advent of mobile phones. Indeed, it would lead to many difficult discussions. At the recent celebration, one of the women, Marie, told me about her call to her young husband to inform him that she would not be home because she was sitting in. He was incredulous; he had just got home from his work and demanded that she get home as well. However, she was equally determined to stay. &#8220;Who&#8217;s gaunae make my tea?&#8221; he asked. She would not be moved and spoke to her father, a trade unionist and Labour man, who intervened on her behalf. Her husband had to get used to making his own tea while Marie, with others, would go on to make Scottish labour history.</p><p>I am told that that first evening was exciting and fun. There were songs and stories and 240 fish suppers washed down with Irn Bru. David Whitton, who was an industrial correspondent at the time and who visited the factory regularly&#8212;he would have loved to be here, but he has a family celebration to attend this afternoon&#8212;claimed that he bought the fish suppers. Many people claim that they did that&#8212;I even think that we claimed it for a while.</p><p>It is fair to say that the women did not expect to be there for seven nights, never mind seven months. News spread quickly. It was the talk of the shipyards the next morning. I had known Helen Monaghan for a considerable time, attending the shop steward courses at the local college, and I and other colleagues went to the factory that morning with some money and messages of support. I can still recall speaking to Helen through those meshed windows that could not open properly. All the faces at the door made me feel like I was visiting prisoners.</p><p>I can also remember one of the first public meetings&#8212;a Clyde shop stewards meeting in Port Glasgow&#8212;at which we heard Stan McNee&#8217;s rallying cry that we would &#8220;not let these Yanks take the jeans off our women&#8221;. The remark proved very popular, given the traditional rivalry between the local young males and the United States navy personnel who were also based in the area, and we collected a lot of support as a result.</p><p>I also recall Helen Monaghan speaking at one of these traditional town hall mass meetings&#8212;other members will know what I am talking about. Confronted with a room filled from floor to gallery with all these shipyard bears, she choked with emotion during her speech and, of course, many heads went down. Noses were blown and handkerchiefs were common; there was not a dry eye in the house. When she finished her speech, the audience rose as one and supported the women in their industrial dispute for the duration of the fight.</p><p>Back at the factory, with its more female occupation, there did not have to be any warnings about bevvying or vandalism. Cleaning and cooking rotas were implemented; the place was spotless. Moreover, maintenance continued to be carried out on the factory machinery, because people fully expected to be working on it.</p><p>There were even babies in the factory, because some of the women had to take children there. Theatre groups performed for them; indeed, our own Sarah Boyack celebrated her birthday at the factory in a red revue performance. Helen Monaghan tells me that, during the difficult times when people started to drift away and morale inevitably began to dip, those performances greatly lifted the women who remained.</p><p>Of course, as with all families, there was some tension among the women. Margaret Wallace and Catherine Robertson were young and full of energy. They could not do enough and were demanding to do more; to put it bluntly, they were doing Helen Monaghan&#8217;s head in. An ideal opportunity came along in the shape of invitations to speak to a range of wild&#8212;perhaps that is a Freudian slip&#8212;and wonderful groups that had shown an interest in what they were doing, and they toured the country. Catherine and Margaret were sent away to tell their story and to raise support and much-needed finance. The money was distributed on the basis of the needs of families, not individuals, which is interesting and was a new approach.</p><p>That released some tension until Margaret and Catherine returned with their various reports. The final straw was when Margaret returned. As she describes, her appearance had changed dramatically over the couple of months. She had been transformed into a person with a cropped haircut, whose favourite colour was black and whose favourite footwear was a pair of Doc Martens. She reported meeting Vanessa Redgrave, who had suggested that armed insurrection was the only reasonable way of gaining success for the working classes. Helen quickly changed tack, and Margaret was redeployed to collect money from shipyards and pitheads, just in case her energy and enthusiasm led to a civil war.</p><p>That straightforward, honest and committed approach to saving jobs confounded and surprised many, and it certainly shocked VF Corporation and the local management, who had abandoned those involved early on. The trade union officials of those involved were bemused and confused by their single-minded determination and refusal to compromise, and the women certainly surprised the wider trade union movement, which was demoralised by the loss of militant car workers at Chrysler, red Clydesiders joining the dole, and shipyards closing. We witnessed the closure of steel plants and, of course, the mighty National Union of Mineworkers was on its knees and under attack.</p><p>In many ways, the people involved in the sit-in gave as much to the labour and trade union movement as they received. They provided a spark of light in a very dark time. Many shared a great sense of achievement with the victory in August 1981. Those people were an inspiration in their leadership under Helen Monaghan. Many who clearly remember the events and many who are MSPs today have told me that they were inspired by those actions.</p><p>While we celebrate the victory this year, I would like to think that the Scottish Parliament was brought about by the resistance of those involved and the resistance of those who fought and did not get victory. This year, we should use the example of their commitment and determination to fight for the right to work and to remind ourselves that the Parliament was set up to ensure that we protect the Scottish people from uncaring Governments that believe that unemployment is a price worth paying.</p><p>I look forward to the film of what happened, and suggest that Peter Mullan or even Ken Loach could make a great film. If Dagenham women can do it, our women can do it. I also look forward to the 40th anniversary of the sit-in and to having a pleasant lunch with Helen, Margaret and Catherine after the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646410", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lee Jeans Sit-in"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank everyone who signed the motion to celebrate this event and everyone who has stayed behind for the debate.

I had to be present at a meeting with a local colleague who faces a difficult situation, but I accept that there is no excuse for being late.</p><p>As convener of the Local Government and Communities Committee, I am pleased to take part in this debate on a bill that is designed to improve and benefit the administration of local government elections in Scotland. I thank all those who provided written and oral evidence to the committee. I also thank our committee clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre researchers and, of course, my fellow committee members for all their efforts during our stage 1 scrutiny of the bill.</p><p>As we have heard, the bill does two main things: establishes, on a statutory basis, an electoral management board for Scotland to oversee local government elections; and extends the Electoral Commission&#8217;s remit to cover local government elections in Scotland. We already have an interim electoral management board that operates on a non-statutory basis and there was widespread support for the next step: putting the board on a statutory footing. Of course, the Scottish Parliament already has powers in relation to local government elections, but not in relation to elections to the Scottish Parliament or House of Commons or European elections. Therefore, the provisions in the bill are restricted to local authority elections. As we know, the Scotland Bill makes provision for the Scottish Parliament to have control over its own elections. Therefore, it seems logical that the electoral management board&#8217;s remit should be extended to include other elections in Scotland, as and when that is appropriate.</p><p>When the minister gave evidence to the committee, he confirmed that the Scottish Government is considering the available mechanisms to extend the board&#8217;s remit once responsibility for Scottish Parliament elections is transferred. We welcome the minister&#8217;s comments in relation to those elections. We also acknowledge the UK Government&#8217;s role in bringing forward legislation to give the board a statutory role in relation to other elections. Therefore, we have called on the UK Government to consider further extensions to the board&#8217;s remit that would allow it to cover elections to the House of Commons, European Parliament elections and referenda. In addition, the wealth of electoral expertise that the board will have could be valuable in the administration of elections to institutions such as health boards and the crofting commission, and we have asked the Scottish Government to consider that.</p><p>There was a great degree of consensus on the bill&#8217;s provisions, but slight disagreement arose in one area. The convener of the electoral board will be a returning officer, will be appointed by Scottish ministers and will, in turn, appoint the other eight members of the board, five of whom must be returning officers or depute returning officers. The Electoral Commission expressed some concern about having depute returning officers on the board as, in its view, they would not be legally accountable for their actions in the same way as returning officers are. However, members of the interim electoral management board and the minister rejected those concerns, on the basis that depute returning officers provide much-needed practical experience and do their work on behalf of returning officers, who are ultimately accountable to the courts. Having listened to the arguments, we agree with the approach that is taken in the bill&#8212;that depute returning officers should be eligible to be full members of the board, especially given the expertise that they will undoubtedly bring to bear.</p><p>Under the bill, the convener of the board will be given a power of direction in relation to local government elections. The Electoral Commission expressed some concern that the bill did not provide for any sanctions if a returning officer failed to comply with a direction issued by the convener. Both the former and the current chair of the interim electoral management board envisaged that there would be a great deal of consultation and consensus and that there should not be any surprises. The former chair, Tom Aitchison, took the view that if a situation arose in which one direction was being issued after another, the board would have failed. However, we noted that the power was needed as a backstop against unforeseen eventualities.</p><p>Effective planning should reduce the need to issue directions. We also think that compliance with a direction will be dependent on returning officers and electoral administration officers adopting a consensual approach. In our report, we recommend that the Scottish Government monitor the effectiveness of the power of direction going forward.</p><p>The board will be required to produce an annual report. We agree with that provision.</p><p>Finally, the bill extends the function of the Electoral Commission to cover local government elections in Scotland. Again, that is a logical step, given that those are the only elections in respect of which the commission has no formal remit. As with so much in the bill, there was agreement on that provision, which will benefit electoral administration in Scotland by promoting consistency and good practice. We also welcome the requirement for the commission to lay an annual report before Parliament.</p><p>Although some of the bill&#8217;s provisions needed clarification, there was a high degree of consensus on what the legislation sets out to do. The committee is of the view that the main provisions will improve electoral administration in Scotland. We support the bill&#8217;s general principles.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643675", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to you, Presiding Officer, the minister and my colleagues for being slightly late.

We will support that expansion, which provides focus and direction to local authorities about the issues, especially antisocial behaviour, that they must take into account when assessing someone&#8217;s registration.</p><p>The bill also provides for all adverts for properties to let to include the landlord&#8217;s registration number. As the minister said, it was important that we had real discussion about the measure, if it is truly to be a means of and tool for enforcement. In the evidence that we received, there was general agreement that it was a good idea. However, as has been mentioned, a number of concerns were raised about how it would work in practice. As the minister said, one issue was that, generally, registration numbers are pretty long, so the number would probably not mean much to the public unless there was some kind of explanation. To let boards would be exempt from the requirement, apparently because it was thought that it would be impractical to have different numbers on different boards. We look forward to hearing more about all that.</p><p>The alternative of having a symbol or kitemark was suggested, but we recognised that there were concerns that any symbol would not be unique and might be too easy to copy. For that reason, the committee suggested that we replicate the system that trade bodies use, under which the kitemark denotes registration but is backed up by a list of registered organisations that are given unique registration numbers. We also thought that using such a system could get round the difficulties with to let boards, so that they might not have to be exempt.</p><p>The Housing (Scotland) Bill proposed increasing the fine for non-registration to &#163;20,000. This bill proposes that the fine should be &#163;50,000. Although we support increasing fines as a deterrent to rogue landlords, we were concerned about the lack of prosecutions, which we saw as, in effect, allowing bad landlords to continue operating outwith the system. We heard in evidence on the bill that the City of Edinburgh Council successfully prosecuted a landlord who had failed to register three of his seven properties, but that the courts imposed a fine of only &#163;65 per property. If we compare that with the amount that it cost, according to the council, to prosecute the case, which was about &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000, we find that there is hardly an incentive to deal with rogue landlords. The current level of fines is significantly lower than the current maximum, and there are a number of difficulties in pursuing prosecutions. That toxic combination left the committee doubting whether a fine could act as a deterrent whatever the level at which it is set.</p><p>Our report makes it clear that there can be a proper deterrent only if courts recognise and impose the higher fines so that local authorities are more prepared to pursue cases. It is vital that the courts give sufficient weight both to landlord registration and to HMO licensing schemes. The committee has suggested that it might be worth having either a dedicated housing court or a housing tribunal. That said, we support the increase in the maximum fine as a step in the right direction.</p><p>During our scrutiny of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, and again during our scrutiny of the Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill that is now before us, one issue that was raised time and again was whether the landlord registration scheme was working as it should, even with the improvements that were being made. There were also concerns that enforcement was not consistent across all local authorities. I am pleased to hear that the minister will be encouraging best practice in that regard, as we know that some schemes could be more proactive.</p><p>It seems that landlord representatives&#8212;the good landlords&#8212;were so disillusioned that they suggested that the registration scheme should be abolished. There was a worry about people not reregistering. We do not agree with that view, but we also do not think that the scheme is working as effectively as it should. When we scrutinised the Housing (Scotland) Bill, we said that we were not sure that the proposals in that bill were sufficient to tackle rogue landlords. We say that again with regard to the Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill.</p><p>We know that the Scottish Government&#8217;s private rented sector strategy group will review the current registration scheme, so we hope that the group will look at how to tackle those issues. We support the bill&#8217;s provisions on landlord registration, but we recognise that they will go only so far. Guidance that the Scottish Government will produce subsequently, and the review of the scheme, will be very important.</p><p>The substantive provisions on HMO licensing that were originally in the Housing (Scotland) Bill are replicated in the Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill. In our stage 1 report on the Housing (Scotland) Bill, we welcomed those provisions, as we felt that they could tackle the breaches of planning control that often result from landlords trying to maximise the letting potential of a property. We took the view that local authorities must use the tools at their disposal in housing and planning legislation to support sustainable communities and to maintain private sector housing.</p><p>The committee considered the Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill&#8217;s provisions to deal with overcrowding. We know that overcrowding is a significant issue in certain parts of Glasgow&#8212;there was a lot of discussion about Govanhill and about the migrant workers who live there, as the minister mentioned. Everyone who gave evidence to us agreed that overcrowding is an issue that needs to be tackled, but a number of concerns were raised about the approach that the Government was intending to take. For instance, some organisations suggested that there should be a duty to deal with anyone who is displaced as a result of their living in overcrowded conditions.</p><p>It became clear to the committee that this is a very complex area: existing legislation can already be used to deal with overcrowding and local authorities already have duties to deal with homelessness in certain situations. On that basis, we support the bill&#8217;s provisions in that regard, although we have concerns about their practical application. We certainly do not want situations to arise where an overcrowding notice is served, but all that it does is to make someone homeless. That would mean solving one problem, but creating another. Neither do we want undue pressure to be put on the social rented sector, with private landlords quite happily breaching the legislation, knowing that local authorities will have to deal with the problem.</p><p>We noted that the minister had given reassurances that the provisions in the bill were not intended to give rise to either of those situations, but I re-emphasise the fact that the current position is complex, and it is really not possible to predict with any certainty how many cases of homelessness there are likely to be across Scotland, and therefore whether or not there will be sufficient capacity in the private and social rented sectors to house people who have been displaced.</p><p>The powers in the bill will be used at the discretion of local authorities and are likely to be used as a last resort, but there is uncertainty about how things will play out in practice and we are concerned about that. That is why we recommended that the Scottish Government consult widely on its guidance on the factors that need to be taken into account before the decision is made to issue an overcrowding notice. We also recommended that the Government monitor the number of overcrowding notices and local authorities&#8217; reasons for issuing them. In that way we should be able to assess how effective notices are in dealing with overcrowding and what impact they have on levels of homelessness and the housing stock.</p><p>We need a fully effective landlord registration scheme to ensure that we weed out rogue landlords. We are not there yet. We welcome the improvements that the bill will bring, but it is clear that more needs to be done. Overcrowding is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. We acknowledge what the bill is trying to achieve, but we are concerned about the practicalities. With those caveats, we recommend that the general principles of the bill be agreed to.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643591", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to take part in the debate as convener of the Local Government and Communities Committee.

It is rare in these times to find under the one roof such an establishment of advice on stability, technical matters and safety, combined with expert, detailed local knowledge&#8212;and it should not be given up easily. Some would say that that type of facility and capability should be the norm, particularly on the Clyde, which is one of the busiest gateways to Scotland and the UK. The Clyde coastguard manages Ministry of Defence traffic, including nuclear submarines, and deals with significant cargo traffic at Clydeport container terminal. It also manages more than 30 cruise liners that arrive in Scotland every year, carrying in excess of 1,500 passengers. We must also remember, of course, that the Clyde coastguard covers ferry routes south as far as Arran and north as far as Mull, with estimated annual passenger numbers of 4 million to 5 million. The potential for human, environmental and, indeed, political disaster is obvious.</p><p>As has been said, given the influence that we have over the consultation, there is something ironic about calling it a consultation; the proposal to close the base was made when the start of the consultation was announced. The First Minister confirmed that there has been an absence of consultation when he confirmed in this chamber that the Scottish Government had not been consulted on the issue. We do not know how far the consultation has gone.</p><p>If the proposals go ahead, the service that is currently provided by the Clyde coastguard would be provided by Belfast, Stornoway or Liverpool. We should not be excitable in these times, but during an exchange with the First Minister during a recent question time I described the decisions as daft and dangerous. I welcome the cross-party support that the First Minister confirmed exists on this issue&#8212;its existence has been confirmed again during this debate. I hope that the minister will update us this evening on the progress that he has made with regard to his representations to ministers to ensure that we have some sort of influence on this so-called consultation.</p><p>In addition, we should bring the hapless Mr Penning, the minister who is responsible for these daft and dangerous proposals, to the committees of this Parliament. The least he should do is attend a meeting of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee&#8212;or whatever committee is deemed appropriate. We should all come together to assist the efforts of the minister and the First Minister to ensure that there is some form of consultation on this matter, to give Mr Penning an opportunity to justify his daft and dangerous proposals, to enable us to question him on his proposals and, I hope, to inject some reality and common sense into the situation so that we can reverse the proposals in the interests of the coastal communities of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643628", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Coastguard Centre Cuts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Alasdair Allan for giving us this opportunity to debate this serious issue this evening.

It knows that the consequences of Government politicians walking by on the other side of the street are high unemployment, low pay, depopulation, a higher dependence on public sector jobs, impacts on health and housing, poor educational attainment and a low skills mix.</p><p>As a community, we worked with the most recent Labour-led Executive and came together to address many of those issues. We invested massively in a new school estate and teachers to address underattainment. We increased the number of people who went through the college at the heart of our community to address and improve our skills base. We voted in extremely high numbers for a housing stock transfer that released massive amounts of money, which is being used to renew existing homes and to build new ones in our area. That is very important in encouraging people to stay. With that support, we also developed a wider range of private sector housing, the price of which was more appropriate for the area. In 2007, we confirmed the future of our local hospital. We set up an urban regeneration company to attract new jobs and to open up the area. We converted our brownfield sites to attract new businesses and jobs. We did all that over that period.</p><p>At this point, it should be said that, in these difficult times, we are not foolish enough to expect increasing budgets to address those issues&#8212;our community is not naive&#8212;but we do not expect to be hit disproportionately hard. In such times, hard-pressed communities should not be asked to pay a higher price than communities that are more resilient to the impacts of the cuts that are in store.</p><p>I thought that the cabinet secretary accepted that the issues that confront communities that are less resilient in the face of cuts should be recognised. When I asked him about that in the chamber on 9 September, he followed up his answer with a letter to me on that very subject, but we know now that what he gave me was no more than warm words. We know that the local government allocation will hit communities that have smaller numbers and which are suffering depopulation.</p><p>As a result, the schools programme will be delayed, if not worse. The cuts that will be made in the number of public sector jobs will have a disproportionate impact on communities such as mine that already have high levels of unemployment. In addition, of course, the housing budget will be cut by around 30 per cent, which will hit our ambitious local programmes for housing and new builds. Some housing associations are already considering rent increases. As we heard from Des McNulty, our local college has declared more than 90 redundancies, and the level of bursaries on offer is to go from the best in the country, recognising the profile of the community, to the worst. The college principal has asked how a total in-year funding shortfall of almost &#163;5.7 million can be bridged.</p><p>The biggest single cut in the SNP budget has been reserved for our successful urban regeneration company, Riverside Inverclyde, which faces a 70 per cent budget cut. No other budget line in the Scottish budget faces such a savage cut, which there can be no doubt goes way beyond any departmental norm and threatens current and future plans for the regeneration of our area.</p><p>The cabinet secretary has left the chamber. I hope that he will read the Official Report tomorrow.</p><p>That cut is a cut made in Scotland that will impact on a vulnerable community in Scotland. The Government has allowed Scottish Enterprise to renege on its commitments to URCs in Scotland, despite being barely halfway through a 10-year project. The decision has angered my community, and my local newspaper has mounted a campaign. The success of the regeneration company is being wasted.</p><p>Is that truly the cabinet secretary&#8217;s idea of a reinvigorating approach to regeneration, as recommended by Sir John Arbuthnott in his Clyde valley review and emphasised by Crawford Beveridge in the independent budget review?</p><p>My community still bears the scars of the previous recession. We have made considerable progress, slowly but surely, in rebuilding the damage created by the Thatcher years. The work of the urban regeneration company is an integral part of that recovery. I call on the cabinet secretary to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, to make good on his commitments to the URCs, and to reinstate Riverside Inverclyde&#8217;s budget so that it can continue the valuable work that it is doing in my community.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 5) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As you will know, Presiding Officer, as it is a community that we share and represent, Inverclyde knows all about hard times.

We were the lead committee that looked at Patricia Ferguson's bill. I thank all the witnesses who provided the committee with evidence and I express my thanks to my colleagues on the committee for their input. I also thank our hard-working clerks and researchers. I pay tribute to Patricia Ferguson for her work in bringing the bill to the Parliament.</p><p>As we all know from our constituency case load, problems with property factors are on the increase, and one of the problems is that the sector remains unregulated. The subject of the disputes that can arise between factors and their clients include the lack of financial transparency, hidden commissions and the unspecified charges to which Patricia Ferguson alluded. We have all heard of the &#163;30 replacement light bulb and other such charges. However, property factors face a <place-holder colnum=\"31296\"/> different set of problems, such as non-paying residents, absentee landlords who have little interest in their properties, and poor maintenance of common areas. Disputes can arise over relatively small matters, but they can escalate, occasionally as far as court proceedings.</p><p>One of the main proposals in the bill is that property factors will have to be registered. That will put them on the same footing as landlords in both the private and social rented sectors, who are subject to a statutory registration scheme. During its stage 1 consideration of the bill, the committee acknowledged the work that the Scottish Government and a stakeholder working group are doing to consider a national voluntary accreditation scheme for property factors. The stakeholder group believes that the voluntary scheme is so far forward in its development that it should be introduced, with a statutory scheme being delayed and implemented only if the voluntary scheme is unsuccessful. The counter-argument is that, unless a statutory scheme is introduced, factors who provide a poor service, who are the least likely to register, will continue to operate and provide an inadequate service to consumers, as no sanctions or standards of service will be set for unregistered property factors.</p><p>On the balance of the evidence, the committee agreed with the view that a voluntary accreditation scheme would ultimately be unsuccessful in dealing with the problem of so-called rogue factors. The committee therefore supports the introduction of a statutory framework as proposed in the bill.</p><p>We heard arguments that local authorities and registered social landlords should be exempt from paying a registration fee, but we recognise that, if those groups were exempt, more of a burden would fall on the remaining property factors. We also heard in evidence that RSLs are already subject to high levels of regulation and that the provisions in the bill would just add another layer of regulation. The committee took the view that, despite the continuing efforts to address the shortcomings in factoring services, tenants who live in social housing still have problems with RSLs and local authorities that provide such services, so they should be included in the definition of \"property factor\" in the bill. The committee also recognised that it is important that land maintenance companies are included in the definition. Although such companies manage, own and maintain land, the bottom line is that they are also property factors and have to be included.</p><p>The final sanction for property factors who continually fail to come up to scratch would be to take them off the register. However, the committee thought that that might lead to problems. Although <place-holder colnum=\"31297\"/> we recognised that such a move would be a last resort, we felt that issues arose with regard to the area where a factor was deregistered. After all, a factor might have a number of clients over a wide geographical area and might be in serious dispute with a client group in one area but not in another. In evidence to the committee, the Minister for Housing and Communities summed up the difficulty when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"if you deregister a local authority, which is quite possible under the bill, what happens? There is no answer.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 22 September 2010; c 3470.]</p><p>Moreover, deregistration poses a number of complex legal issues with regard to maintenance companies that own the land and can be responsible for providing factoring services for woodland areas, sustainable drainage systems and other items of infrastructure. As a result, we felt that the bill had to be sufficiently clear to ensure that there were no unintended consequences, such as home owners being left without a factor or issues arising from deregistering a land-owning maintenance company. Indeed, as we know from our case load, those who do not have a factoring contract also look to us to help them to resolve some of these issues.</p><p>We know that the bill gives Scottish ministers the power to set the time and date for a factor to be taken off the register. However, although we acknowledge Patricia Ferguson's argument that a date could be set that would give people enough time to make other arrangements to ensure they were not left without a factor and would allow anyone removed from the register to appeal the decision, we think that that might not be enough. As a result, we suggest that the member look at other solutions such as giving ministers the power to remove someone only when they are satisfied that transitional arrangements have been put in place. We look forward to representations being made and these issues being clarified by the member at stage 2.</p><p>A code of conduct will be key to improving property factors' performance and, under the bill, ministers will be able to prepare such a code to set out the standards that are expected of the industry. That will definitely serve a useful role and help to drive up standards. However, because the code will be introduced through secondary legislation, the bill contains nothing that witnesses could comment on, and we support the requirement for ministers to consult on a code before it is laid before Parliament.</p><p>The failure to resolve disputes has been one of the biggest problems between factors and their clients. The committee heard about factors not responding to letters or phone calls, unitemised <place-holder colnum=\"31298\"/> billing, unexplained charges and high insurance charges. Consumers are frustrated and feel that, unless they resort to court action, which as we know is unpredictable, very expensive and not very satisfactory, they are powerless. Property factors themselves feel similarly frustrated and, to break the cycle, the bill proposes a dispute resolution procedure through the creation of a home owner housing panel and home owner housing committee, which will be similar to the existing private rented housing panel and private rented housing committees. The minister said that he would prefer an ombudsman system to what is proposed in the bill.</p><p>There is clearly a need for some kind of dispute resolution procedure. However, in the current financial climate, we have to be aware of the costs to the public purse. Because the panel will be demand led, working out how much it will cost to set up has been problematic. That said, the same can be said of the ombudsman option and we have called on both the member and the minister to provide further information on both options.</p><p>Overall, we recognise that the bill's main purpose is to create a statutory framework to protect the interests of home owners contracted to property factors and agree with the member that legislation is needed for such a scheme to work. Although we have highlighted a number of areas that need further consideration or amendment, we recommend that the bill's general principles be agreed.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21129301", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Property Factors (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be taking part in the debate as convener of the Local Government and Communities Committee.

Subsequently, we were the lead committee for the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill, which decoupled the local government and Scottish Parliament elections. Only this week, we began scrutiny of the Local Electoral Administration (Scotland) Bill, which picks up on some of our recommendations.</p><p>Those who were at the committee earlier this week heard the Electoral Commission in Scotland speak about the challenges that it recognises that the combined referendum and elections and the combined Westminster and Scottish Parliament elections will present. They also heard from the interim electoral management board for Scotland about the concerns that returning officers have raised in respect of those matters, which have still not been resolved.</p><p>The committee worked closely with the Scottish Government in holding a voter turnout seminar in the Parliament in June this year. Also, as recently as 30 September, it held a meeting with the UK Parliament Scottish Affairs Committee to discuss common ground and share the work that both Parliaments have done on the issue. Although, as we have heard in the debate, there were differences of opinion, emphasis and concern about the risks, there was also consensus among the committee members who met the Scottish Affairs Committee that holding the AV referendum on the same day as the Scottish Parliament elections raised a number serious concerns and gave rise to serious reservations.</p><p>In July, on the basis that the Secretary of State for Scotland wanted to work with those who expressed an interest in the matter, we wrote to the Presiding Officer, expressing our interest. On 7 October, we wrote to the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, on the issue, outlining our involvement in these matters and expressing an interest in being <place-holder colnum=\"30668\"/> contacted and involved. To the Deputy Prime Minister's shame, he has not responded to the committee, despite the press reports that we read and the fact that ministers are dealing with Scottish MPs, Scottish Government ministers and party leaders on the matter. The Parliament needs to be brought back into the discussions; the fact that we have not been involved is not very satisfactory. Nevertheless, I hope that members agree that the committee has carried out a significant body of work that will help to inform our choices as we move forward on the issue.</p><p>Regardless of the impact on our elections, the decision to proceed with a referendum on a fixed-term UK Parliament was disrespectful not only of our practice and procedures, but of the principles of openness and transparency that we have in the Parliament. I know that the Parliament can do better. We know that we can make informed choices, as we have done, and learn lessons. The committee knows that it can work across the parties and with the Scottish Government. Parliament surely recognises that there must be an opportunity for scrutiny of those who have created this situation. There must surely be scrutiny of those who support the decision, and there must be scrutiny of those who will have responsibility for running the election, because they know about the practical differences that we heard about earlier this week&#8212;the practicalities of the postal ballot, the different registers, the three ballot boxes and the reconfiguration of polling places that will be necessary. Those are practical issues that the Parliament needs to understand before we come to a view.</p><p>Finally, there must surely be an opportunity for individuals and organisations that have long taken an interest in the matter to be heard.

It would be a mistake for the Scottish National Party Government and its supporters in the Liberal Democrats to regard John Muir simply as a bereaved father speaking out only for his family's loss.

On the committee's behalf, I thank all those who gave evidence to us. In particular, I thank the minister's officials for responding to our numerous requests for additional information. I also thank my fellow committee members for their hard work in considering the bill. Last but not least, I express my gratitude for the support that was provided by the committee's clerks and researchers.</p><p>The Housing (Scotland) Bill proposes to introduce another layer of housing legislation in Scotland. The bill includes a range of new provisions and amends a number of previous acts, but it seems that the Parliament will need to consider yet further housing legislation, as the minister has made a commitment to introduce another housing bill later in the session. The committee believes that it would have been preferable to have consolidated many of the provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Bill with those that will appear in the proposed private sector housing bill. We would have preferred to consider the changes to existing legislation in their totality. In our view, that would have been a far simpler approach than the one that the Scottish Government has pursued.</p><p>The committee acknowledges that the Government carried out an extensive and inclusive consultation with stakeholders in preparing the Housing (Scotland) Bill. However, the committee is concerned that there was no evidence of direct engagement with tenants other than through those stakeholders. We hope that the Scottish housing regulator will do better in taking up the challenge of consulting with tenants directly, because we believe that it is crucial that the views of tenants, not just of their representative bodies, are taken into account in determining social housing priorities.</p><p>In its stage 1 report, the committee decided to focus its consideration on four key issues: the modernisation of social housing regulation, the reforms to the right to buy, the amendment of legislation on private sector housing, and issues relating to the licensing of houses in multiple occupation and to the protection of unauthorised tenants. Whereas my committee colleagues will <place-holder colnum=\"27584\"/> cover specific aspects of the bill in their speeches this afternoon, I will outline the committee's key conclusions and recommendations.</p><p>The bill's proposals on the modernisation of social housing regulation were broadly welcomed by the witnesses who gave evidence. The committee supports the provisions that will establish the Scottish housing regulator and confer on the SHR its objective and functions. The committee concurs that a single regulator will provide the simplest and most effective means of ensuring a consistent approach to the regulation of all social landlords and the services that they provide to tenants. Furthermore, the committee recognises that the inclusion of the objective for the regulator to safeguard and promote the interests of persons who are or who may become homeless will support efforts to tackle homelessness. The committee also considers that the role that housing associations can play in wider community regeneration is important and should be recognised by the Scottish housing regulator in the implementation of its objective.</p><p>The evidence that the committee heard on the Scottish social housing charter demonstrated widespread support for the charter among stakeholders. The provisions seem to satisfy the demands for flexibility in balancing national outcomes with&#8212;this is an important point&#8212;local needs. The charter will also provide a means of raising standards in social housing. However, the committee calls for as much direct consultation of tenants as possible in the preparation of the charter.</p><p>The second area that the committee focused on was the reforms to the right to buy. The committee noted that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Scottish Government has ensured that those tenants with an existing right to buy retain that right\"</p><p>but, as the minister noted, the bill will end the right to buy for new tenants who enter the social rented sector, reform the pressured area designation and end the right to buy for new-supply social housing.</p><p>In general, those three proposals were welcomed in evidence to the committee, although there were some differences of opinion. Some stakeholders called for more measures to ensure the retention of housing stock in the social rented sector, while others expressed concern about the effect of loss of receipts from sales. The Scottish Government has taken into account situations in which tenants could be disadvantaged by the reforms and has included exemptions to protect them.</p><p>There was overwhelming evidence from a variety of organisations testifying to the complexity of the legislation on the right to buy. The committee concurred with those organisations <place-holder colnum=\"27585\"/> that, if enacted, the bill would further complicate the position, so it was of the view that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it will be particularly important to communicate the right to buy provisions clearly to tenants so that they have an accurate understanding of their entitlement to right to buy.\"</p><p>The third area that the committee considered&#8212;the amendment of legislation on HMO licensing and the extent to which it would address the problem of rogue landlords and the flaunting of licensing requirements&#8212;turned out to be one of the most challenging. The committee took evidence in the knowledge that additional provisions were likely to be introduced in subsequent legislation but without knowing the exact nature of those provisions.</p><p>It was established that the success of the register requirement has been patchy, with more proactive local authorities achieving high registration rates. Particularly notable is the fact that not a single landlord has been prosecuted for failing to register since the relevant legislation was enacted. The lack of prosecutions has had the effect of allowing bad landlords to continue to operate outwith the system, which has meant that protection for the most vulnerable tenants has been limited. It appears that, as it is currently framed, the bill will not address that issue.</p><p>The committee was of the view that increasing to &#163;20,000 the penalty for failing to register might act as a further deterrent to landlords who do not register, but it felt that unless a greater incentive was provided for local authorities to pursue a prosecution, that provision would not have the desired effect. We believe that the requirement for landlords to register needs to be promoted and that additional methods should be used to identify unregistered landlords. Those methods could include sharing data and requiring letting agents to check landlord registration and to provide information on the identity of a landlord to a local authority.</p><p>When it considered the proposals on houses in multiple occupation, the committee came to the conclusion that the legislation on HMOs was complicated and dislocated, which we believed clouded its original purpose and hindered the capacity of local authorities to deal with the problems with HMOs in their areas. The committee welcomed the new provisions in the bill as a means of further protecting groups such as migrant workers and felt that the provisions could tackle the breaches of planning control that often result from landlords trying to maximise the letting potential of a property. We took the view that local authorities must use the tools at their disposal in housing and planning legislation to support sustainable communities and maintain private sector housing.<place-holder colnum=\"27586\"/></p><p>The final area that the committee considered was that of the protection of unauthorised tenancies, which was rendered difficult by the fact that the committee had to report on the bill at stage 1 before the repossessions group had completed its work and reported. Nevertheless, the committee concluded that it was important to strengthen and clarify the legal position of tenants in relation to repossessions when there is an unauthorised tenancy. I note that the repossessions group's report was published last week and the minister covered the issue in response to the committee's stage 1 report.</p><p>The committee raises a number of significant issues in its report, and I am sure that my committee colleagues will provide more details about some of them during their contributions to the debate. With the caveats that I have mentioned, the committee supports the general principles of the bill and recommends to the Parliament that they be approved.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20861155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As convener of the Local Government and Communities Committee, I am pleased to present the key conclusions from our stage 1 report on the Housing (Scotland) Bill.

The situation facing local government was described by Professor Alan Alexander, one of our witnesses at a round-table event, as the \"perfect storm.\" We have increasing demand for the services that councils provide, an aging population demanding better social care, higher demand for homelessness and other welfare support services, increased pension contributions and equal pay settlements. If that were not bad enough, it seems that even the weather is against councils, as they have just come through the worst winter that we have seen in many years and have had to endure significant flooding problems in parts of the country. That is set against a situation in which local government is unable to raise council tax and has had little or no increase in funding centrally, with council tax becoming more difficult to collect in a recession and the income raised from building warrants being on a downward spiral.</p><p>Against that backdrop, in June last year we announced our inquiry to ensure that there was a wider understanding of and debate on the financial pressures on local government. We began taking evidence for the inquiry in September 2009 and published our report in January of this year. I thank everyone who gave evidence to our inquiry, all the members of the committee and our clerks and researchers for their hard work, patience and support.</p><p>During the inquiry, there was a question about whether problems had arisen as a result of the recession or whether the recession had just exaggerated existing financial pressures that should have been addressed. Some of our other work, such as our inquiry into the debacle that is equal pay, suggests that some problems are of the councils' own making. However, whatever the basis for the current situation, it is clear that different choices will have to be made and that there will be no quick fix.<place-holder colnum=\"26317\"/></p><p>We recently wrote to all 32 local authorities to find out what the up-to-date position is with their finances. The 27 responses that we received showed that the situation is pretty bad at the moment and likely to get worse over the next few years. Our inquiry report anticipated that, so we looked at how those financial challenges could be addressed. I think that everybody realises that the scale of the financial issues is such that they cannot be addressed merely by looking for efficiency savings. However, finding efficiency savings is important, and authorities should constantly strive to be more efficient and provide value for money.</p><p>Local authorities and trade unions told the committee that a lot of inefficiency had already been driven out of the system. However, some other witnesses, including Audit Scotland, were more sceptical, with some believing that the necessary scale of efficiencies could be achieved only with greater regulation. The committee nonetheless concluded that the way forward was to undertake more work on benchmarking to improve performance and efficiency. That is now being progressed by the Scottish Government and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers&#8212;we welcome movement in that area.</p><p>The other huge issue relating to efficiency savings is shared services. Just before we concluded our inquiry, Sir John Arbuthnott published his report on joint working and shared services in the Clyde valley, and there was certainly a lot of food for thought in that report. There was concern that local authorities had not done enough of that kind of work in the past and that decisions were being taken now only in response to the financial crisis rather than because of any kind of long-term change in the management process.</p><p>In his report, Sir John Arbuthnott said that local authorities</p><p class=\"indent\">\"cannot meet this challenge with short term solutions, such as year on year efficiency savings or 'salami slicing' budgets. The Councils and their public and private sector partners need to take a more strategic long term view.\"</p><p>However, witnesses told us of tensions that can arise when services are shared or centralised. For example, a national scheme to drive efficiencies in procurement might involve a cost to the local economy.</p><p>The Arbuthnott report also highlighted a range of supports that the Scottish Government could provide. One suggestion was that the Scottish Government might introduce secondary legislation to smooth the way for interauthority shared services. The Government's response to our report did not offer a view on that proposal, but it confirmed that work is on-going to see what further <place-holder colnum=\"26318\"/> could be done. Perhaps the cabinet secretary will take the opportunity today to outline some of that work.</p><p>Public services cannot be delivered without staff, but when budgets are tight, questions are inevitably asked about whether big enough savings can be made without impacting on pay and jobs. Of course, none of that is easy. It is never easy for politicians to cut the wages of their voters or to threaten them with the sack. In local authorities, the big issue is that staffing accounts for about 50 per cent of total budgets, so how we achieve savings is a very pertinent question.</p><p>From the local authority responses that we received, it is clear that many authorities are looking to shed jobs to balance their books. In the main, they are trying to avoid going down the route of compulsory redundancies and are trying to manage any job losses by way of turnover and not filling vacancies or by voluntary redundancies. However, several authorities indicated that the scale of future budget deficits is likely to mean that compulsory redundancies cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The committee fully appreciates that such decisions are difficult. Like freezing pay, reducing staff numbers might seem an attractive option to achieve savings, but we also appreciate that it is not a good idea to cut capacity to the extent that it will be difficult to deliver services in the future.

In fact, one council said in its latest response to us that it would not achieve a new saving for up to two years because of the need to make redundancy payments. That, too, needs to be taken into account. Making public sector workers redundant is a very expensive process.</p><p>Another issue that councils need to consider is whether they should charge for services. A number of councils already charge for services, <place-holder colnum=\"26319\"/> but there is no uniform charging policy across the country. Although we can see that councils are perhaps being pushed in that direction, we agreed with the Arbuthnott report's recommendation that councils should work together to introduce consistency</p><p class=\"indent\">\"where this does not cut across local priorities, to make this more easily understood by citizens and to avoid a 'postcode lottery' for fees and charges\".</p><p>The responses that we have received from councils suggest that existing charges are increasing by 2 to 3 per cent and that a number of councils have introduced, or are thinking about introducing, new charges.</p><p>As I have said, we wanted to look at how local authorities could deal with a looming budget crisis. As our report outlines, there are various ways in which councils can make&#8212;and are making&#8212;savings, but in the round-table discussion Professor Alexander highlighted the significant issue of the lack of flexibility that is available to local authorities. He said that when the recession bites, they will have to make economies where they can rather than where they would choose to. Many in the third sector would claim that that is happening already and that they are paying the price. That would be considered a short-term decision.</p><p>The committee is acutely aware that the choices on services that local authorities make now will have a significant impact on the people of Scotland, and that we will all have to live with those consequences.

They have created a system that has produced results for people with serious conditions such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. As a result of our work early in the life of the Parliament, when we focused on such <place-holder colnum=\"26254\"/> areas, there are people in my constituency who have lived longer and whose quality of life has been improved.</p><p>We introduced targets and we drove up standards so that unacceptable waiting times for surgery and treatment would no longer be commonplace&#8212;as has been referred to by the cabinet secretary and Michael Matheson. I agree with them. However, although the complaints at our surgeries have changed, the case load has not. I completely agree that those changes in complaints have concerned the quality of service, particularly for the elderly.</p><p>There are still areas where we have not achieved what we would have liked to achieve&#8212;in vitro fertilisation treatment, for instance. People who cannot pay still wait for two years or more for IVF, and that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Reductions in waiting times are seen as an achievement, but however successful and popular they are, they have come at a price. Hospital wards and staff are geared up for the production line. I do not treat that in a negative way, as it is very efficient when it runs smoothly and it ensures that people enjoy a positive and speedy experience. However, when we push people through the system, the consequence sometimes is that we push the caring out of the system.</p><p>I had my own experience recently as a day patient requiring surgery. I was in in the morning and out in the evening, and I had a good and positive experience at Inverclyde royal hospital. If people can walk in and walk out, the experience is great. However, I also have personal and casework experience of what happens to elderly and frail people who require extra treatment. A receiving ward in an acute hospital is not a good place for those people. They have extra demands, which in my experience and from my case load I know are not being addressed. While we celebrate the achievements and recognise the progress that we have made on waiting times, we need to have a balance.</p><p>I share the cabinet secretary's enthusiasm to deliver a patient-centred approach in our health service. I believe that it is possible to take the benefits of the targets system that we introduced and marry it with an approach to care and support that all patients require. Whether that is possible in the current climate is another question. Whether we like it or not, the strategy comes against a backdrop of falling investment, services being axed and hundreds of staff facing cuts.</p><p>In today's debate, we have heard several examples of the cuts that health boards have been forced to make. More than 1,250 jobs have gone in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and I am fearful of what that will mean in Greenock and <place-holder colnum=\"26255\"/> Inverclyde. We also know, as was mentioned earlier, about recruitment issues, which are particularly important in respect of continuity of care. Nurses and midwives are leaving the country to get their first jobs while, as Christine Grahame mentioned, existing staff in the service work longer hours and overtime. Any of the health board reports will identify that massive problem.</p><p>None of that bodes well, and it undermines our shared ambition of delivering a world-leading health service. It is easy to say that we will deliver the type of health service that we all hope for, in which quality of care is premium, but it is much more difficult to put it into action.</p><p>To demonstrate that, I will cite the example of the Ardgowan hospice in my constituency, which for nearly 30 years has provided an excellent transport service for patients who require cancer treatment outwith the area. As members will appreciate, it is more than just a pick-up and drop-off service. It spares people who are in a weakened condition an awkward journey, it spares them the inconvenience of waiting around before and after what can be a very arduous treatment, and it offers some much-required comfort after what is sometimes a harrowing experience. I have spoken to volunteer drivers and heard of the bond that they develop with patients during these difficult, and now shared, experiences.</p><p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, in its 2010 \"Palliative Care Health Needs Assessment\", stated that patients</p><p class=\"indent\">\"found this to be a very welcome support that reduced the added stress that the ambulance transport brought to an already stressful experience.\"</p><p>However, when budgets were reviewed at the health board, it was decided that it could no longer fund the service. It would seem that, from an annual budget of &#163;2.6 billion, the health board is unable to find the &#163;35,000 that is required to support the transport service. Is that an example of quality being considered over cost? Is it a decision that is likely to inspire confidence? Is it responsive to what, in the terms of the cabinet secretary's motion, users of the health service \"want, need and deserve\"?</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive Question Time: \"The Healthcare Quality Strategy for NHSScotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As has already been said, we can share a great deal of pride in the achievements of the NHS and its staff in Scotland.

Lack of competition is the issue there.

I am getting confused in my old age. I noted down three different times for the debate&#8212;2.45 pm, 3.00 pm and whenever I was to arrive. Please accept my apologies. No offence was intended.</p><p>I am pleased to be taking part in this debate as convener of the lead committee that considered the bill. I pay tribute to Christine Grahame for bringing forward the legislation and to Alex Neil for his work on the bill before he was elevated to ministerial office. I also thank all the witnesses who provided the committee with evidence, particularly the dog wardens who gave good and practical evidence on their daily and weekly involvement in dealing with dogs that are out of control. I think that all committee members were impressed with the evidence. I am also grateful to my colleagues on the committee for their input and to our clerks and researchers, who were as hard working as ever.</p><p>In the time that is available to me, I intend to focus on just a few of the key issues on which the committee reported. The bill seeks to address the underlying reasons why dogs become out of control and dangerous. I am no expert on dogs. That said, all politicians have experience of dogs&#8212;including dangerous dogs&#8212;from delivering leaflets and campaigning. From the evidence of the experts, it is clear that a dog becomes dangerous; it is not born that way.</p><p>As Christine Grahame said, the bill is about prevention. It seeks to influence the behaviour of the dog owner in order to improve the behaviour of the dog. We all can conjure up images of people <place-holder colnum=\"23650\"/> who use dogs almost as offensive weapons. In that regard, the committee supports the introduction of a dog control notice regime. The notices have become affectionately known in the media as dog antisocial behaviour orders&#8212;or dog ASBOs&#8212;a description that is perhaps not entirely wide of the mark.</p><p>The committee welcomes the fact that the focus in the bill is on deed and not breed. That is unlike much of the current dog legislation, where the focus is the other way round or, if I might be indulged for a moment, Presiding Officer, where the tail appears to wag the dog&#8212;boom, boom.</p><p>There were some concerns in evidence about the definition in the bill of a dog that is out of control and the use of terms such as giving rise to \"reasonable ... alarm\" and \"apprehensiveness\". We felt that such language was imprecise and could lead to confusion in interpretation, particularly for those who are charged with determining whether a dog is actually out of control. It is important that there is clarity in that regard.</p><p>The committee welcomes the bill's intention to address a deficiency in the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 so that if a dog attacks someone in the home in which it is kept, the owner will no longer be immune from prosecution. I am sure that all members have seen and read about the devastating consequences of attacks by dogs in the home, especially where young children were involved. If the bill goes some way towards preventing such attacks, it will be worth while.</p><p>I turn to the issue of cost. Given the poverty of information regarding the number of dangerous dogs in Scotland, the committee and Christine Grahame acknowledged that there is a degree of uncertainty about the financial assumptions that have been made in the financial memorandum. The Scottish Government also acknowledged that the estimates</p><p class=\"indent\">\"may be on the low side\".</p><p>Local authorities expressed concern to us about the bill's assumption that no additional costs to them would arise from the legislation.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20561442", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Control of Dogs (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise, Presiding Officer, for arriving late in the chamber.

We held some fairly hefty evidence sessions and additional committee meetings, for which I thank the hard-working clerks and the Scottish Parliament information centre team, who did all the heavy lifting in that respect, and my committee colleagues. I also thank those who submitted written evidence&#8212;we received a lot of it&#8212;and those who came along to the meetings to give oral evidence.</p><p>All the evidence showed us that, in football parlance, this is a bill of two halves. Part 1, which is concerned with helping home owners who are at risk of having their homes repossessed, commanded support for its general principles. However, part 2, which deals with bankruptcy, threw up a lot of disagreements and was far more problematic.</p><p>One of the big issues that the committee considered was whether the right balance had been struck between the need for sufficient consultation and the need to take action quickly. We are acutely aware of the current economic situation, and we know that there have been 48,000 repossessions in the UK in 2009. Although that figure is much lower than the original and more pessimistic estimate of 75,000, it nonetheless represents an increase of 20 per cent on the number of repossessions in 2008. On balance, we think that the case was made for part 1, which deals with repossessions, to be implemented quickly.</p><p>However, things were very different with regard to part 2, which introduces proposals on bankruptcy that were not specifically recommended by the debt action forum. We heard very different views about the operation of the forum, with regard to whether proceedings were to be kept confidential, and whether people were aware of what would be in the bill and what would be subject to further consultation. We do not think that part 2 strikes the right balance, and we believe that the consultation on it was unsatisfactory.</p><p>For a number of people, having their home repossessed is a very real threat, so it is important to ensure that repossession is a measure of last resort. The committee welcomes the measures that are proposed in part 1, and we have made a number of recommendations on specific proposals. The first is on the proposal that when someone voluntarily gives up their property and hands their keys in, they have to sign an affidavit to certify that they do not occupy the property and <place-holder colnum=\"22365\"/> neither does anyone else. There were two different views on that. There were concerns that, apart from being overly bureaucratic, the affidavit process would prove costly for people who are already saddled with debt. We think that, overall, there are advantages in having a formal process, but it seems to be counterproductive to introduce a system that is so bureaucratic that it is not used. We ask the Scottish Government to think again about that issue, and to lodge amendments at stage 2 if that is appropriate.</p><p>The bill outlines what it refers to as pre-action requirements, which creditors have to satisfy before they consider repossession. There is already a pre-action protocol in England and Wales, which, as its name suggests, is a protocol rather than something that is set out in legislation. Again, there were slightly different views on whether it was better to have that in legislation than in a protocol, and on how the protocol had worked in England and Wales. On balance, the committee supports the principle of enshrining those pre-action requirements in legislation to give them more force.</p><p>The bill will effectively allow someone to recall a decree, and restart court proceedings and present their case. However, there can be only one application, and it can be made only if the person did not participate in the original proceedings. We realise that we cannot have a situation in which an infinite number of people can restart proceedings. However, the committee believes that the bill should be amended to allow a second application if the court is satisfied that the application is being made for a different reason.</p><p>We welcome the proposal to allow lay representation in repossession cases, but we also seek a lot of reassurance in that area. A number of organisations will be allowed to act as lay representatives, including those in the advice sector. We are concerned about the bill's impact on the advice sector and whether the sector has the necessary resources and capacity to deal with what might be a lot of extra work and increased expectations.</p><p>On funding, &#163;3 million was made available for legal advice and representation, but that was more than a year ago and the money is already funding 16 projects. We do not know whether there will be enough funding to meet the extra demand under the bill. That is why we have asked the Scottish Government to outline how it will support the delivery of the bill's provisions and to report back to us on an on-going basis.</p><p>I turn to the aspects of the bill that caused the committee the most concern&#8212;the various proposals on bankruptcy. The first proposal is to create a new route into bankruptcy called the certificate for sequestration. There was support for <place-holder colnum=\"22366\"/> that, albeit with some dissenting voices, but what has caused the most consternation is the proposal that the Accountant in Bankruptcy will automatically become the trustee in such cases. That was not recommended by the debt action forum. We received a huge number of submissions from insolvency practitioners who objected to that role for the AIB. The committee questioned whether the AIB will have enough resources and expertise to carry out that new role. That is why we have asked the Scottish Government to provide further information on the work that is likely to be involved for the AIB and how that compares with what it does now. We have also asked the Government to give us the basis for its assumptions on the number and grade of additional staff who will be required.</p><p>The other major issue with part 2 is the way in which family homes are treated in protected trust deeds. We heard the minister's comments on that earlier, so I can miss out the crash course in bankruptcy law. However, it is important to say that, if someone has a protected trust deed, creditors are prevented from taking court action against them and must accept the payment that is made under the arrangement. However, a trust deed can become protected only if the whole of the debtor's estate apart from items such as essential household goods is transferred to the trustee, and that includes the person's house. The bill allows the trustee discretion to exempt the family home from the protected trust deed. At present, there is no such discretion.</p><p>A lot of criticism has been levelled at that provision. Much of it stems from differences of opinion about what the bill is intended to implement. Again, that shows the unsatisfactory nature of the consultation. If there had been proper consultation, those differences of opinion might not have arisen. Concerns were raised that the provision could be subject to abuse&#8212;for example, someone might buy an expensive property in the knowledge that it could be exempted and the equity in the house could not be touched. The Minister for Community Safety said that the intention was that family homes would be exempted in cases where there was limited equity, although, as we have heard again today, no limit is set out in the bill. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland suggested that that there should be a cap on the amount of equity. The minister thought that there were a number of difficulties with that, although he said that he did not have a closed mind on the matter.</p><p>A number of other concerns were raised about the exemption of the family home. For example, the Law Society of Scotland said that that could upset the balance of insolvency law, because the family home will be exempted under a protected trust deed but not in the case of bankruptcy. That <place-holder colnum=\"22367\"/> will be the subject of further consultation. We state in our report that, regardless of the validity of the arguments for and against the provision, we are concerned that there has been such disagreement, and we believe that it arose because the consultation was unsatisfactory.</p><p>The lack of consultation came up again in connection with the bill's proposal to stop advertising bankruptcies and trust deeds in the <em>Edinburgh Gazette</em>, but we have heard what the minister has to say on that issue. As he knows, the <em>Edinburgh Gazette</em> has disputed the figures in the Government's financial memorandum on the costs of advertising in the journal. We recommend that urgent discussions take place to sort out the matter.</p><p>We are also concerned that the AIB-run register of insolvencies might not be able to provide all the necessary information by the time the bill is implemented. As a result, we recommend that the Scottish Government provide further information on the precise work that will be undertaken on the register and, crucially, the timescales for that work.</p><p>If this has been a bill of two halves, an own goal has been scored in the second half. Part 2 contains significant areas of disagreement, although I should point out the consensus on exempting homes with limited equity from trust deeds. The advice sector strongly supports the new certificated route into bankruptcy&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20463950", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Local Government and Communities Committee had, as the minister mentioned, a limited amount of time in which to consider the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill.

In recent years, the sad deaths of Damian Muir and Darren Pyper, who were killed by knives, shocked a community that had become sick of the endless cycle of violence.</p><p>We have worked as a community to try to break that cycle and to bring our experiences and influence to the Parliament. We have welcomed the changes over recent years whereby sentencing powers have been increased, although we have been disappointed that those powers have not been used to the full. Over the years, we have engaged with a wide range of groups and initiatives. We have met the violence reduction unit. We have joined with the medics against violence. We have supported the Inverclyde initiative in its aim of educating young people about the consequences of violence. We have rallied and marched with the friends and fellow pupils of tragic schoolboy Darren Pyper to create awareness of the dangers of knives. We raised a petition with John Muir, Damian's father, and presented it to the Parliament to engage with the democratic process. We held a summit in the Parliament and another in our town hall&#8212;organised by the local paper, the <em>Greenock Telegraph</em>&#8212;to give voice to the community's concerns. In the time since, John Muir has tirelessly campaigned across Scotland. His campaign has struck a chord everywhere that it has gone.</p><p>Having engaged in that parliamentary process, we saw the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill as an opportunity to introduce the tougher sentences and to fund the interventionist measures that people wanted. Today, they will have heard that their calls for tougher sentences are to be ignored in the bill and that funding for preventive measures are not in place. They will have heard that these violent people will be less likely to go to jail and their communities and neighbourhoods will not be safer as a result. To hear their concerns dismissed will greatly disappoint them. To hear the cabinet secretary describe short-term prison sentences as respite care will give no confidence to my community.</p><p>Rhoda Grant and David McLetchie outlined the detrimental impact that could result from the bill's measures on domestic violence. A look at last week's report by the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration shows that nine children under the age of two&#8212;they were babies&#8212;died in recent years in incidents in which domestic violence and aggression were background factors. That is much more than just a debating point. Such an additional significant risk to the lives of our women and children must be measured against a proposal that the cabinet secretary hopes&#8212;only hopes&#8212;will reduce reoffending.<place-holder colnum=\"21664\"/></p><p>I believe that the bill is an opportunity for this Parliament of the Scottish people, which was set up to bring solutions to Scottish problems, to send a clear message to people who carry and use knives. My community does not have to look far for experiences in which knives have caused misery and heartbreak, as has happened across Scotland. Just a fortnight ago, we were told of an appalling murder whereby a young man, who was a visitor to this country, with a pregnant wife at home in India, was randomly murdered in the street.

None of us is getting any younger, and we all have parents who are getting older. Just when we think we are escaping the responsibilities of child care, we sometimes meet the reality of the increased responsibility of elderly care. I am sure that there are many members with personal experience of care services represented in the chamber today. Inevitably, there will also be plenty of personal experience of failures in those services when we have needed them.</p><p>Members encounter a steady stream of problems and issues that are brought to them by constituents. Inverclyde, in my constituency, has suffered from a decline in population but will experience 16 per cent growth by 2031 in the number of people who are over 65. In such a community, elderly people are dependent for care on other elderly people, who will soon get to a stage at which they themselves need to access care. By 2031 it could cost &#163;3.5 billion&#8212;more than treble the current level of spend&#8212;to provide the health and social care services for older people in Scotland that we currently provide. The minister talked about that, and we can all agree that it is an issue.</p><p>There will be varying degrees of need, as Ian McKee pointed out&#8212;I look forward to taking him for a long walk off a short plank at Leith waterfront some time&#8212;but the issue will not go away. It will grow, and we will be presented with a huge challenge&#8212;and I repeat, \"we\". Of course there will be arguments about our big brother in London and where we can get &#163;30 million to plug a gap, but the overall responsibility is ours. We are talking about our parents and our older people, in our communities. Rather than row about all that, we should concentrate on things that we can affect.</p><p>Free personal care is rightly viewed as one of the Parliament's achievements. The minister will remember working on the issue in health committees in previous parliamentary sessions. Our focus was pretty narrow at the outset&#8212;it was <place-holder colnum=\"20561\"/> on the cost to families of residential care&#8212;but now, after all those years, we are starting to think about the 69,000 people who receive care at home. Many of those people cannot get out of the house to go for a swim. Sometimes they are forced to leave not just their family home but their community to get the appropriate care, because the Parliament has not connected up with local government and all the agencies to provide the services, aids and adaptations that would enable them to stay at home. Such matters are our responsibility and no one else's, and we should consider them, rather than fight over who should be paying for what and dropping problems on other people's budgets, as we all do. It sometimes seems that the health service and local government get involved not to consider people's needs but to argue about whose budget a service will come out of.</p><p>Similar issues arise in the debate on child protection. All sorts of people are responsible for child protection, but until we get someone in the Cabinet who has their hands on significant budget streams we will never pull everything together.</p><p>We need to realise that if we are to protect the health service, as we are doing, there will be consequential cuts in the local government budget and every last penny will be squeezed out of services. Care workers who deliver services will face greater demands and workloads and will have less time, less training and fewer opportunities to develop skills. The people who ultimately suffer will be the older people who need the services.</p><p>I understand that the balance between value and quality is difficult to strike, but there are issues that we need to confront. Evidence that the Local Government and Communities Committee heard showed that there is sometimes no correlation between what is paid out and the quality of the outcome.</p><p>The \"Panorama\" programme, which has been mentioned many times, was shocking. Secret cameras uncovered serious neglect as overworked and low-paid carers struggled to provide standards of care that we could be proud of. Leaving aside the question of whether it is appropriate to care for an elderly man while using a mobile phone, the programme raised serious questions about how we procure care services. Until that point, such services were procured by a reverse e-auction, going to the cheapest price, like Bid TV for cheap jewellery&#8212;that was how we procured our services for the elderly.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20269457", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elder Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Ian McKee, I declare an interest.

However, I regret the fact that we must have such a debate, because it means that equal pay still has not been fully sorted out in local government and that cases for a large number of workers, especially low-paid female workers, remain unresolved.</p><p>Councils and unions made an agreement on single status way back in 1999. It is now 2009, but issues have still not been resolved. I do not intend to go through the various delays in implementation of single status&#8212;the Finance Committee's report on the issue in session 2 dealt with that issue well. However, if implementation of single status had not been delayed, we might not be where we are today. The current position is quite concerning. At the time of our inquiry, around 35,000 equal pay cases were lodged with tribunals, with no resolution in sight. We wanted to assess fully the current situation and, crucially, to look at potential solutions.</p><p>I thank everyone who gave us oral and written evidence. Thanks are also due to the clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre and all committee members who worked on the issue.</p><p>Our report sets out the background to the current situation, helpfully explains the different types of equal pay claims that might be lodged and makes a number of recommendations that we hope will bring some kind of resolution. Essentially, single status was supposed to be implemented in all local authorities to harmonise terms and conditions and to eradicate discrimination. At the time of our inquiry&#8212;10 years down the line&#8212;26 of the 32 local authorities had implemented it.<place-holder colnum=\"20144\"/></p><p>Equal pay claims can arise for a number of reasons. There may be work rated as equivalent claims, where jobs have already been rated the same. That was the case for manual workers in local authorities, where an evaluation was carried out in 1987 but workers continued to attract different earnings, mainly through the payment of bonuses. Work of equal value claims may arise because an authority has not implemented equal pay or, where it has, because individuals claim that equal pay has not been implemented properly. There may also be claims as a result of recent court judgments, about which I will say more later.</p><p>Throughout our inquiry, everyone kept telling us how complex the situation is. We realise that the issues can be complex, but we know that local authorities have not only an obligation but a duty to ensure that there is equal pay for work of equal value. We need to find a way through the problems. The situation has become even more complex because of the legal rulings and case law that have developed. That is not surprising, given the time that it has taken to implement single status.</p><p>It became clear to us that it is likely that, of the thousands of cases that have been lodged, a fair number could be considered strong cases. In some of them, the main issue is not whether discrimination occurred but the level of compensation that was offered. Our view on strong cases is the same as that of Philip Barr, the human resources director for the City of Edinburgh Council, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is a no-brainer for most councils: we cannot win these cases in court.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 18 March 2009; c 1815.]</p><p>Councillor Michael Cook of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it seems to me only common sense that if the cases are persuasive and have strong merit the local authorities will be under pressure to look at settling them.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 22 April 2009; c 1915.]</p><p>For all of those fine words, cases are not being settled. To be clear, the committee is not asking local authorities to settle cases that they think have no validity, but surely it serves no one well for strong cases not to be settled. The problem is that no one seems to be prepared to make the first move and that there is no agreement on how to take things forward. Regrettably, this has become a very litigious situation&#8212;unions are taking cases against local authorities and no-win, no-fee lawyers are taking cases against unions and local authorities. While all of that is going on, low-paid workers are being denied justice and compensation. Justice delayed is justice denied.<place-holder colnum=\"20145\"/></p><p>That is why the committee recommended that all parties&#8212;local authorities, unions and lawyers&#8212;should be brought together to reach an agreement on how to deal with cases in the system that are considered to be strong. They need to be brought together by someone, and we believe that that someone should be the Scottish Government. We are not suggesting that the Scottish Government should look to impose any kind of settlement; we are simply saying that it should facilitate a meeting.</p><p>Our recommendation echoes the call by the Finance Committee in session 2 for all parties to enter into discussions, facilitated by the Scottish Executive, to sort out the implementation of single status in all local authorities. The deputy convener of the Finance Committee at that time is now the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth. We were disappointed that, in response to our recommendation, he did not offer to facilitate a meeting, saying instead:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Scottish Government has encouraged COSLA to find a solution to this point and will continue to encourage COSLA to resolve issues ... quickly\".</p><p>However, I was pleased that in his response Councillor Michael Cook of COSLA said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I will undertake ... to write to all councils suggesting that if there are claims which are particularly meritorious, then early consideration should be given to reaching a settlement.\"</p><p>It continues to concern us that, if the nettle is not grasped now, we will make no progress and will find ourselves in the same position months, if not years, down the line. In the intervening period, there could be another set of court judgments or case law, with the result that, as soon as one set of problems is resolved, another arises, adding to the already extensive costs.</p><p>One case has become known as the Bainbridge judgment. Following an evaluation, pay protection was found to favour male employees&#8212;another complication&#8212;and was considered discriminatory. Although the Bainbridge judgment is not a blanket ruling, and each pay protection scheme should be considered on its merits, it is clear that it will be difficult for local authorities to prove that such schemes are not discriminatory. The judgment could give rise to further claims and costs. Although not all authorities believe that it will, the committee wants to stop the situation becoming more complicated. That is why we have recommended that, if it has not already done so, COSLA should publish comprehensive guidance and advice to local authorities on the implications of the judgment.</p><p>We are also asking COSLA to consider putting together a framework agreement, with a payment matrix, and to agree that with the trade unions, to deal with any cases arising from the Bainbridge <place-holder colnum=\"20146\"/> ruling. We suggest a payment matrix because we do not want to get into the situation that we are in at moment of cases being taken because the compensation that has been offered is not sufficient. To ensure that there is agreement on the matrix, we say that compensation levels should more accurately reflect the individual's loss, which may not have been the case in the past.</p><p>Of course, all of that costs money. We are all aware that there is a major squeeze on public sector spending. However, although we are in tough times, we must remember that many local authority workers have been discriminated against and should be paid compensation. That is why we have recommended that, in the all-party discussions that we have said should take place, consideration should be given to staged payments. That would make it possible to set compensation at a level that is acceptable to individuals and their representatives but in a way that allows authorities to spread payments over a certain time period.</p><p>The Scottish Government can also help with funding for equal pay by allowing local authorities to capitalise their assets. In other words, authorities should be allowed to treat new expenditure as capital and not revenue and so fund that expenditure through borrowing or capital receipts. We were pleased to hear that the Scottish Government has begun discussions with COSLA to put in place a capitalisation scheme in Scotland. We ask the Government to produce a timetable for establishing the scheme as soon as possible. In its response to our report, the Government confirmed that a scheme outline had been agreed and that it would be discussed shortly with HM Treasury, which has to give its approval. Perhaps the cabinet secretary can update us on those discussions. We take encouragement from the news over the past couple of days that additional money will be made available in England and Wales through such a mechanism to address the issue.</p><p>With all the emphasis on claims for back pay for past discrimination, we must not lose sight of the fact that we have to ensure that we have robust, non-discriminatory pay schemes going into the future. Alex McLuckie of the GMB summed that up neatly when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Equal pay is about setting the future rate. Believe it or not, that could be more advantageous to female workers than the back money. If someone has 20 or 30 years to work, they will benefit from the higher rate for 20 or 30 years.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 11 March 2009; c 1782.]</p><p>It is disappointing that there is still disagreement over whether the councils that have implemented single status have eliminated discrimination. The unions assert that discrimination still exists, but <place-holder colnum=\"20147\"/> COSLA does not accept the point. As a committee, we will not try to arbitrate on the issue, but we hope that our recommendations go some way to resolving it. We recommended that COSLA should introduce, in conjunction with the unions, an agreed and independent assessment system for new pay and grading arrangements. We further said that Audit Scotland could check whether that had been done as part of its best-value audits.</p><p>We also recommended that, if local authorities were not already doing so, they should carry out annual equal pay audits. Finally, we recommended that the Government should have discussions with COSLA on the issue of regular reviews and equality proofing. We welcome the Government's response that it is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"happy to work with local government to improve and advance equality\".</p><p>That said, I would welcome some detail from the cabinet secretary on what that will mean in practice in relation to equal pay.</p><p>This was a deeply frustrating inquiry for the committee to undertake&#8212;frustrating because everyone seemed be say, \"We recognise that there are issues to be sorted out. We are willing to sort them out,\" but the issues have not been sorted out. Our committee is the third committee of the Parliament to have looked at the issue of equal pay. If it was frustrating for us, we can only imagine what it is like for the workers who have not yet been properly compensated. Have workers not been compensated because they are low-paid women workers?</p><p>In our evidence taking, we heard stories of compensation offers&#8212;they could also be called bribes&#8212;being dangled in front of low-paid workers just before Christmas, a time when the prospect of a reduced offer may appear better than no offer at all. We heard about low-paid women who had been in the system for nearly six years. Our recommendations give a way forward. I hope that all parties take them on board. As a committee, we want to continue to monitor whether progress has been made. We will do so.</p><p>All the unresolved issues create a huge amount of uncertainty in what are already uncertain times. We need to resolve past discrimination, but we also need to ensure that discrimination does not happen again. As our report says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That will give the greatest certainty.\"</p><p>I am happy to move the motion on behalf of the Local Government and Communities Committee.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Local Government and Communities Committee's 12th Report 2009 (Session 3): <em>Equal Pay in Local Government</em> (SP Paper 292).</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20200694", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Official Report 1 October 2009: \"Equal Pay in Local Government\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to open this debate for the Local Government and Communities Committee.

They spoke about children who are</p><p class=\"indent\">\"never in the same house two nights running\"</p><p>and about</p><p class=\"indent\">\"families in which the mother and gran are addicts, and it is the great-gran, who is in her late 70s, who is looking after young children\"</p><p>without adequate support. They described a drug withdrawal process that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"can take five or 10 years\",</p><p>and they said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"health visitors have really big case loads ... so ... they are really reliant on parents to make contact if any problems arise.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, Health and Sport Committee</em>, 25 March 2009; c 1715, 1723, 1705.]</p><p>Children's services were also described as \"haphazard\", and mention was made of social workers being refused access to vulnerable children. All of that is on the parliamentary record for members' attention.</p><p>Although I accept that more work needs to be done through an inquiry to establish some areas, I am impatient for action. I believe that there are things that we can do straight away to mitigate the impact of drugs on vulnerable children. What needs to be done? We need to meet the basic requirements that were set out in the \"Hidden Harm\" report. We need to accept that there are risks for children associated with living with an addicted parent; we need to identify and assess the level of risk; and we need to ensure that those children's needs are met. It is not good enough that we cannot identify all the children in question. Finding them and assessing them must be our starting point. If a care plan is good enough for the addicted parent, it is surely good enough for the child of an addicted parent.<place-holder colnum=\"19942\"/></p><p>It must be accepted that children who live with parental addiction are at risk&#8212;they might be at varying degrees of risk, but they are at risk all the same. Part of the process must involve assessment of parental capability. We must ensure that social workers and children's care services have sufficient powers to get access to those children when their parents refuse to engage with care services.</p><p>The significant support that we provide to those adults, such as child benefit, housing benefit and the medical support that we offer through the methadone programme, needs to be set out in a contract so that they understand why we are giving them that support and, crucially, what we expect of them in return in terms of behaviour, parental responsibility and a commitment to progress towards a drug-free lifestyle. Lastly, the contract must point out the consequences of failure, which could affect their continued receipt of support and could include the possibility of their children having to be taken into care. If drugs cannot be taken out of the home, we need to take children out of the home. That is the reality.</p><p>The sad fact is that, if Brandon Muir had not died, he would still be living in that house of horrors, experiencing all the abuse and neglect that marked his troubled young life. Thousands of other children are surviving what Brandon was put through. They will grow up with the legacy of those traumatic experiences and, sadly, will often repeat the mistakes of their parents. We must act: we must continue to do more and do better to end that miserable cycle. If we do not, more children will face the misery that Brandon and others suffered.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20197282", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Child Protection"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is only correct that we recognise the progress that has been made following the \"Hidden Harm\" report, but that progress must be   measured against the scale of the problem.

I now represent a community that is well aware of the consequences of losing a major employer, or a number of major employers, and knows all the pain of being overdependent on large employers in shipbuilding, engineering, electronics and, now, the service industry.</p><p>I also worked for a number of years as a trade union organiser in the whisky industry. That was a decade or more ago now, when we were dealing with the problems of overcapacity and overproduction. At that time, we had great bragging rights about who got the best wages&#8212;Chivas, Johnnie Walker, Hiram Walker or Cutty Sark at Drumchapel. We believed that we were in an internal market, but of course we were not; we were competing with those companies' bottling plants in the Philippines and elsewhere in the world.</p><p>When Diageo took over, it won the argument and the J&amp;B plant in Dumbarton in which I <place-holder colnum=\"19690\"/> organised closed down with a loss of about 400 jobs. Given my experience, I have every sympathy with the people in Kilmarnock, because I know at first hand the challenges that they face individually and as a community.</p><p>Over the years, if I have learned anything it is that change is inevitable. Whether we live in an independent Scotland or a Scotland that is part of the UK, under any Government change is inevitable. We as politicians have to recognise&#8212;as I did when a trade union official and as an individual in the past&#8212;that our role is not necessarily to prevent change but to manage and facilitate it over a period of time to ensure that the least damage possible is done to workers and their communities.</p><p>I do not blame MSPs and MPs for fighting their corner for their constituents. Willie Coffey has done well, as have Des Browne and others. They are elected to articulate the anger and frustration that their communities feel. I do not blame the First Minister for being angry with Diageo for its poor communication. I do not blame them, because I have been there and done that. However, I am concerned about the damage that might have been done to the relationship with one of Scotland's most significant employers. That needs to be addressed. I am concerned about the message that is sent to other employers, which might be dissuaded from engaging with the Government and its agencies on what they need to do to change to equip them for the future, as a result of the negativity surrounding the Diageo decision. After all, we all recognise that it is not a popularity contest. It is not a competition to see who cares most about the workers who are affected. Those people deserve better than that. Honesty is hard, and there will be no cheers at the end of this process for doing the right thing. The very least that the workers deserve now is honesty.</p><p>For the past few months, we have all collectively tried to hold the waters back, but, in the end, the reality defeated the rhetoric. Now we have to face facts and learn lessons from that experience. That means being honest about what a Government&#8212;any Government&#8212;can achieve and what we can deliver politically. We need a clear and consistent approach that we can apply anywhere, every time a company or a sector faces challenges, no matter whether it is big or small, urban or rural. We need to establish confidence in that approach, with a clear policy that encourages companies to come to us early, not at the point of crisis, after a decision has been made. We need to understand and respect the needs of companies to grow, survive and be competitive, as well as to meet their social responsibilities. Instead of becoming sidetracked with what we cannot deliver for people who are losing their jobs, we need a process that <place-holder colnum=\"19691\"/> is committed to what we can deliver. That means adequately funding and resourcing partnership action for continuing employment and supporting people, not to save people's jobs but to get them their next one.</p><p>I am sorry to mention it again, minister, but at HEROtsc&#8212;a contact centre in Greenock that shed more than 150 jobs earlier this year&#8212;I was concerned about the level of support that was provided to the employees who lost their jobs. It is not clear whether additional resources were assigned to that situation or whether the intervention was successful. With the prospect of significant change facing 700 workers at T-Mobile, I repeat my call to the Government to engage with the call centre industry before it is, once again, too late.</p><p>Despite my reservations, I believe that the PACE approach is a good one. However, we will get out of it only what we put into it. It must be not only a response mechanism but a delivery mechanism. Employers, businesses and communities need reassurance that there will be support, that similar or better jobs will be provided, and that communities will be protected from the impact of difficult decisions.

I thank all those who gave us written and oral evidence and I thank the clerks, the Scottish Parliament information centre researchers and my colleagues on the committee.</p><p>Whether to decouple the local government and Scottish Parliament elections, and the debacle of the 2007 elections, are issues that the committee has considered in great detail. Ron Gould produced a comprehensive report and, following its publication, we conducted our own inquiry into the issues, on which we reported to Parliament in June 2008.</p><p>Among our many recommendations, we endorsed the view that the Scottish Parliament and local government elections should be decoupled. It was clear from the evidence that we took that, although there have been differing views over the years, there is now broad agreement that the elections should be separated.</p><p>However, some concerns were raised with us, which we have highlighted in our report. The first of those is about turnout, which is an issue that we also considered as part of our inquiry into the 2007 elections. People were concerned that if the local government elections were held separately, turnout would fall. However, we recognise that the issue of turnout is broader than just the decoupling of elections. In evidence, Dave Watson from Unison said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"All of us&#8212;civic society, politicians, political parties and local authorities&#8212;need to focus on the reasons for the low turnout by doing much more work to make people want to turn out in local elections.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 25 March 2009; c 1884.]</p><p>We welcome the indication from the Minister for Parliamentary Business that he would be happy to engage with the committee on that, and we look forward to working with the Scottish Government on the issue. I hope to hear&#8212;today or soon&#8212;how we can take that work forward.</p><p>Our report shows that we are concerned about voter registration. Of course, that is a reserved issue, so we are calling on the Scottish Government to continue to work with the UK Government to increase levels of registration.</p><p>As we are all painfully aware, there was a lot of voter confusion during the 2007 elections. In our inquiry into those elections, we pointed out that the high level of rejected ballots in the Scottish Parliament election should not eclipse the high level of rejected ballots in the local government elections. It is clear that there needs to be further information about how the STV system works.</p><p>Ron Gould said in his report:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In essence, the local government elections are not simply about ensuring a reasonable number of voters show <place-holder colnum=\"17444\"/> up at the polls on polling day. More important is that they engage with the campaign in a meaningful manner and make a knowledgeable decision on their ballot paper.\"</p><p>There is a consensus that there needs to be an information campaign to raise awareness about the importance of local government elections and to educate people on the method of voting.</p><p>We have asked the Scottish Government to consider the role that the Electoral Commission can play in any information campaign, given that it does not have a statutory role in relation to local government elections in Scotland. Given the need for a good information campaign, it is also important that there is sufficient funding. Tom Aitchison, the chief executive of and returning officer for the City of Edinburgh Council, told the committee that he remembered being allocated somewhere in the region of &#163;15,000 to promote public awareness in 2007, which does not seem sufficient funding for a city the size of Edinburgh. He told us that he would</p><p class=\"indent\">\"strongly support any move towards making more resources available generally for election management in Scotland and specifically for public awareness to encourage people to vote and so get a better turnout.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 25 March 2009; c 1865-66.]</p><p>Given how vital public information campaigns will be in helping people to engage with the process and educating them about the STV system, the committee has recommended that there should be a meaningful discussion with local authorities over the funding that would be required, and that that funding should be reflected in the next Scottish Government spending review.</p><p>Funding is also an issue when it comes to e-counting. After 2007, the word \"e-counting\" should send a shudder through most of us in the Parliament. However, we need e-counting for local government elections because of the counting method that is used for STV elections. Again, that raises the issue of costs.</p><p>The Association of Electoral Administrators was concerned about that, given that the Scotland Office will not be contributing as it did in 2007.

Equally, I am sure that we all agree with the minister that a secret ballot is fundamental to democracy and that any changes must protect that fundamental right. We agree with the minister that this is a balancing act that we have to get right. The Electoral Commission appears to agree that using a threshold of 200 votes will help to protect a voter's anonymity. As we say in our report, it is clear that the proposal in the bill to publish voter information at polling-station level is welcome, provided that adequate measures are put in place to ensure the secrecy of the ballot.</p><p>I have spoken about the potential costs of public information campaigns and the e-counting system, and I return to the issue of costs.

We are aware of concerns about the need for all of this to be adequately funded, and we have recommended that the Scottish Government should take account of those concerns in determining local government funding requirements for the next spending review.</p><p>I have spoken about the concerns that we have highlighted in our report.

The minister said that homelessness is a continuing and significant challenge. I do not know whether he stopped short of making a commitment on that, but \"straining every sinew\" does not guarantee that we will meet the targets. Some 9,500 people are in temporary accommodation, of course.</p><p>The flip-flop on the HAG subsidies cannot be flicked away. Such flip-flopping has tainted the minister's predecessors and has left housing associations receiving &#163;6,000 less for every new home that they build. The situation is difficult for them, and it will result in the Government failing people of all backgrounds and ages. The Government is failing young people who want their first home, older people who want to stay in their home but not be prisoners in it, and families who are living in overcrowded and unsuitable homes.</p><p>Sadly, we know that the situation could have been different. Tenants in Inverclyde had the good sense to vote for housing stock transfer and now enjoy growth, investment, new houses and modernisation. That process also empowered communities and made tenants stakeholders in their neighbourhood. Those tenants had the confidence to take matters into their own hands and they achieved that result and significant investment despite the best efforts of the minister and his colleagues, who fought tooth and nail to oppose the measures. We simply need to look at the situation of our neighbours in Renfrewshire and Lanarkshire to know what our fate would have been if we had not had the good sense to vote for housing stock transfer.</p><p>I hope that, in the minister's summing-up speech, he will have the good grace to acknowledge and confirm the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing's statement to the Local Government and Communities Committee that finance for housing from the UK Government will be spent on housing.

Those rights will correctly be restored today. The disease, with all its aspects, will be properly acknowledged. Once again, the Parliament, with cross-party support, has come down on the side of the victims of asbestos-related disease.</p><p>More than most, the campaigners I met today, who are in the public gallery, will well understand that this country has an adversarial system of <place-holder colnum=\"15644\"/> justice, in which the ill and the dying have been victimised time and time again. We have heard from Des McNulty how that has happened. There have been delays and blanket denials at a terminal point in many people's lives. Their very existence&#8212;and where they worked, who they worked for and what ship they worked on&#8212;was denied. They were nothing in the system. Today, we hear that some of that injustice is being addressed.</p><p>As Nigel Don said, in a stage 3 debate, we often repeat what others have said, and, as members have said, I am pleased that the Scottish Parliament has a proud record in this area. Back in 2000, I hosted one of the Parliament's first members' business debates on mesothelioma, with the support of 45 back benchers. We have hung together on the issue for a long time.</p><p>I have been aware of the blight of asbestos throughout my time as an MSP and in my life before entering the Scottish Parliament. As many do only too well, I understand the difficulties and the humiliations that victims have sometimes had to endure at the hands of the courts in trying to obtain the justice that they were well due.</p><p>Over the years, several members have distinguished themselves on the issue. I am happy to recognise the contribution of politicians from all parties. As has been said, the late Margaret Ewing campaigned on the issue here and in Westminster. I also recognise the contributions of Robert Brown, Stewart Stevenson, Pauline McNeill, as the Justice 1 Committee's convener, Hugh Henry, in his ministerial role and&#8212;of course&#8212;Des McNulty, whose record I contend is second to none.</p><p>I regret that, unless the Conservatives change their minds, we have lost Bill Aitken along the way. He is another member whom I would like to have commended today. I consider the costs and the price that is paid to be much more than a line on a balance sheet; they include the cost to health, the impact on communities and on families, the ultimate price that too many have paid and the indignity that people have suffered. Like others, I ask the Conservatives to ask themselves again about costs and price and to move beyond the balance sheet.</p><p>The Justice Committee's work should&#8212;rightly&#8212;be praised. We might have lost Bill Aitken along the way, but I am pleased that the parliamentary campaign has new recruits, such as Bill Kidd and Stuart McMillan, who have continued the Parliament's tradition. Bill Butler's work is also to be recognised.</p><p>The progress that has been achieved could not have been accomplished without the efforts of victims&#8212;I was reminded of that today when I met <place-holder colnum=\"15645\"/> campaigners. Despite terminal illness, victims have fought the good fight literally until their last breath. In the debate in 2000, I paid tribute to Owen Lilly&#8212;a Clydebank man who showed true Clydeside spirit. He participated in a film that shocked many by showing the horrors of mesothelioma and brought home the plight of victims to a wider audience. Joe Baird, my old friend and the chairman of the shop stewards in Scott Lithgow, fell victim to asbestos. Despite his problems, he retained his dignity, his humanity and his campaigning spirit throughout that difficult time. Despite their illness, people such as Jim McAleese have provided support for the Inverclyde support group for many years.</p><p>Of course, for those who have lost relatives to this awful disease, the fight continues. The families refuse to give up the fight for what is rightly theirs&#8212;the right and just campaign. They have been ably supported by campaign groups such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos and Clydebank Asbestos Group, by friends in the trade union movement&#8212;in the GMB and Unite&#8212;and by lawyers such as Frank Maguire of Thompsons Solicitors, who have all played a major part in bringing about the bill.</p><p>All parties can&#8212;rightly&#8212;be proud of the Parliament's record on the issue. We have consistently highlighted the insurance industry's dirty tactics and its attempts to spin out cases to avoid or reduce its liability. The bill marks another milestone for the Parliament, which, as Bill Kidd said, is connected to its communities and knows where they stand. However, it is the external influences&#8212;the unions, lawyers, pressure groups and victims&#8212;that have given the Parliament another opportunity to do what is right. I urge all parliamentarians to pass the bill, to ensure victory today, which will belong to all the campaigners for this just cause.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14794129", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the bill.

This is the first time that a proposed national planning framework has been subject to scrutiny by the Parliament and its committees.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee welcomes the opportunity that it has had to debate a significant document and to contribute to the process. I thank the committee clerks and Scottish Parliament information centre researchers for the help that they have given to the committee. I also thank the other two committees that have contributed to the debate through their reports&#8212;the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee and the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&#8212;and all those who made written submissions or gave oral evidence.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee recognises that the proposed national planning framework is an evolving document and will be subject to further scrutiny and monitoring through continuing dialogue between the committee and the Scottish Government. It is clear from our report that the committee is generally positive about NPF 2, but we believe that lessons can be learned for the future.</p><p>The first lesson relates to accessibility. We know that planning is a complex subject, and we welcome the efforts that the Scottish Government has made to make the document more user friendly and accessible, but it appears that even experts have found it difficult to wade through. For example, Bob Stewart of the Scottish Society of Directors of Planning said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is not an easy read, even for a professional with some 42 years' experience. It will be refined as we go through the process, and as we do so it would be helpful if it was improved and simplified.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 14 January 2009; c 1551.]</p><p>Planning is an extremely important subject. In order to be as accessible as possible to as many people as possible, future NPF documents should use clear, jargon-free language to ensure that the <place-holder colnum=\"15527\"/> public are well informed about the key issues and feel able to engage in the consultation process. Although I am sure that the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change had his tongue firmly in his cheek when he described the document to the committee as \"a rattling good read\", he did say that he would be happy to consider comments about language and presentation and to learn from them.</p><p>We also believe that there are lessons to be learned on the consultation process. We acknowledge the Scottish Government's efforts to engage with stakeholders and the general public through an extensive consultation programme, but community groups that responded to the committee's consultation raised concerns about the level of consultation locally. As some of the impacts of NPF 2 are likely to be felt most at that level, it is vital that local communities are engaged in the consultation process. We therefore recommend that the Scottish Government consider ways of further improving the consultation process so that local communities can be more effectively engaged in the future. We suggest that local authorities could have a role to play in maximising awareness at a local level, and we encourage the Government to look at that possibility.</p><p>One of the more contentious aspects of NPF 2 is the list of projects that are to be designated as national developments. The committee's focus was primarily on process issues, not on the merits or otherwise of the national developments&#8212;other committees have considered them&#8212;and we have commented on the consultation. A number of concerns were raised in evidence about the lack of consultation on the revised list of national developments. In particular, people were not clear about how the list was developed and revised and why some projects had been included and others had not. That complaint was not limited to local community groups; again, I quote Bob Stewart of the Scottish Society of Directors of Planning:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"local authorities and others made a considerable number of suggestions about alternative national projects. The process of sifting those projects has not been transparent and it is not clear how we arrived at the projects that are listed in the NPF.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 14 January 2009; c 1547.]</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14772080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Planning Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to open today's debate.

We therefore believe that there should have been a separate consultation on the revised list. We also think that the Scottish Government should have been clearer about why suggestions for national developments were accepted or rejected and that individuals whose suggestions were rejected should have been properly debriefed.</p><p>My final point on the process is to reinforce the committee's plea for more notice to be given of the laying of the next NPF so that committees can properly plan a programme of scrutiny and engagement. Sixty days is extremely tight, and the more notice that we are given, the better.</p><p>Turning to the substantive issues in the document itself, we focused on the flexibility of the framework, its impact on the planning system and the funding, timetabling and delivery of national developments. Given the current economic climate, we believe that it is essential that the framework is flexible enough to respond to ever-changing circumstances, and we welcome the Government's assurance that the document is not a fixed blueprint.</p><p>The construction industry in particular has been badly hit by the current economic situation. The committee heard evidence from the industry that it is crying out for infrastructure projects to be brought forward to stimulate the industry and the economy and to help keep capacity. Michael Levack of the Scottish Building Federation told us:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we are losing capacity in a serious way&#8212;by the day. It is very difficult to predict what the next six months or year will hold. I am always surprised when people speculate that there will be some recovery in the economy during 2009. Personally, without wishing to wear the black hat and sound a note of doom and gloom, I think that it will be 2011 before we see any improvement in the situation. That is why we are constantly calling for some infrastructure projects to be brought forward, to allow us to retain capacity in the industry.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 14 January 2009; c 1540.]</p><p>The Scottish Government said to us in evidence that it will bring forward construction projects in which it has control over the timetable, and it cited the Forth crossing and strategic rail enhancements as two examples. The committee believes that, given the current economic situation, the Scottish Government should consider opportunities to bring forward projects that are publicly funded. We recognise that some projects are either wholly or partly funded by the private sector, and for that reason we also recommend that the Scottish Government engage with the private sector to consider the opportunities of bringing forward further projects. The issue is an important one for many people, and we would welcome <place-holder colnum=\"15529\"/> reassurances from the Government that it will pursue those discussions.</p><p>The Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006 requires ministers to set out in the framework a statement of need for any development that it designates as a national development. Although that does not automatically remove the need for planning permission or other consents to be obtained for a development, it means that a planning authority cannot reject an application for a national development that is listed in NPF 2 on the ground of need. Parliament needs to be clear about the significance of NPF 2 in that regard.</p><p>The committee believes that the Government needs to provide further clarity on the funding and delivery of national developments to ensure that they are not simply aspirational but firm commitments to build. I have mentioned the effect of the economic climate on the construction industry. If no clarity is given on the timetabling of the national developments and associated infrastructure, the Government will simply add to the uncertainty and leave the industry and others unable to plan ahead and make projections. There will also be an effect on local communities: people need to know when a national development is likely to come on stream locally.</p><p>The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee expressed concern about the delivery and funding of the national developments. The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change also said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The framework does not represent ... a single penny of public funding\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government and Communities Committee</em>, 21 January 2009; c 1579.]</p><p>On that basis, the committee struggled to see how the national developments in the NPF, which is essentially a planning document, link to the Scottish Government's future expenditure proposals. We seek clarity from ministers on the funding of national developments in relation to those expenditure plans: we have agreed to take further evidence from the Government on that, but some clarity today would be very welcome.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14772080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Planning Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. I will plough on because I have limited time; I am sure that Patrick Harvie will get another opportunity.

She described to me in graphic terms the amount of time, energy, physical effort and planning that was involved in taking her mother on her weekly outing to the local supermarket, and she told me of the anger and frustration that she felt when she was denied a parking space there by an inconsiderate able-bodied person. For someone with an impairment, that is not simply an inconvenience. Only a carer can truly know how difficult and undignified it is to manoeuvre someone into a wheelchair in a standard car-parking space. Even the most mundane but important task, such as going to the shops, the <place-holder colnum=\"15239\"/> post office, the GP or the hospital, can be a real challenge.</p><p>Evidence that was presented to the Local Government and Communities Committee confirmed the scale of the problem. One in five disabled parking bays is used by drivers without a blue badge. More than a third of our car parks have no accessible bays free for disabled people because of the level of abuse. Some 85 per cent of disabled spaces are not enforceable in law. A survey in Dumfries and Galloway found that 50 per cent of bays in hospital car parks were taken by drivers who did not have a disabled badge.</p><p>Amidst the gloom, there are notable exceptions, as we have heard. Asda, which gave good evidence to the committee, is leading the way with an enforcement scheme that has increased the availability of disabled parking spaces at its stores by 60 per cent. That evidence gave us an insight into what the bill can achieve. Sadly, others stores have not followed Asda's example. It pains me to say it, but a scant inspection this week of supermarket car parks in my constituency that are not part of the Asda chain&#8212;whose inspection officer is in the public gallery today&#8212;found many disabled car parking spaces that were occupied by people who were not displaying a blue badge, apparently fearless of challenge. We accept that there will be an implementation stage, as the minister said, but I suggest that, once the bill is passed, stores that do not already reach the Asda mark should not hang around much longer. They should listen to the message and act to achieve what Asda has already achieved.</p><p>For too long, disabled people have had to rely on other drivers not to take reserved parking spaces out of courtesy and consideration. The committee heard evidence that, sadly, when disabled people complain to drivers who abuse disabled spaces, the complainers can receive abuse and even threats of violence. Therefore, as has been said today and in evidence to the committee, the age of relying on politeness has ended and the age of enforcement has come. That is welcome and long overdue.</p><p>Although the bill will in due course change the quality of life of many Scots, it is worth mentioning that the benefits may be wider than the mobility benefits for disabled people. Evidence to the committee confirmed that people who break rules in one part of their lives are likely to break rules in other illegal ways. Research shows that those who are careless and thoughtless enough to take up disabled parking bays are more likely to have a criminal record, and that 50 per cent of them have a history of traffic violations. One in 10 cars that are found abusing disabled parking spaces is in an illegal condition. The top criminologist Sylvia Chenery of University College London's Jill Dando <place-holder colnum=\"15240\"/> institute of crime science supports the bill and says that a crackdown on the abuse of disabled parking spaces could nail some of our most wanted criminals. She has reminded us that the Yorkshire ripper was caught because he had a dodgy licence plate. Perhaps the minister can discuss that issue with his colleagues. Enforcement of disabled parking spaces might be an efficient way in which to target active criminals and offenders, as well as illegal vehicles.</p><p>Today is a day to celebrate all the efforts of disability campaigners over many years, including those involved in the eye-catching campaigns such as the space invaders and baywatch campaigns. A lot of work has gone on for a long time. My committee colleagues will take pleasure in the passage of the bill. Those campaigners have had their concerns listened to and, more important, acted on. There is no doubt that the change will improve the lives of many Scots. The campaigners are also to be congratulated on recognising that, in Jackie Baillie, they found a politician who shared their concerns and their determination to change things for the better. As has been acknowledged today, she is a politician with all the necessary skills to ensure the safe passage of the bill without amendment, with the support of the Government and, I hope, with the unanimous support of the Parliament.

It is not that I dropped off during that last contribution.</p><p>The Parliament welcomed the minister's announcement last December, in that at least the statement recognised, in a small way, that too many of our children in this small country can no longer safely stay at home with their parents. It recognised that they need to be rescued from dire circumstances, which are driven in the majority of cases by parental drug misuse. It recognised that we need to increase the number of places of safety for those children&#8212;places that do not exist in sufficient numbers.<place-holder colnum=\"13318\"/></p><p>The Parliament also welcomed the proposals that sought to recognise properly the work of foster carers and, for the first time, the important role of kinship carers. We gave that support not without question. The minister will recall that I shared the concerns of NCH&#8212;now called Action for Children&#8212;that, if adequate resources were not provided, we would not be able to deliver.</p><p>Like others, I asked some specific questions. How much money would be available? How many carers would benefit? Would the allowance be available in all local authorities? I suggested that those questions needed to be answered if we were to avoid a cruel deception being played out on kinship carers. We regrettably have our answer today.</p><p>The minister is in some difficulty, which was reflected in his speech. He has to ask himself whether he has done everything possible to ensure that those children stay within the wider family, as he said he would in his press release on the day of the announcement last year.</p><p>As stated in <em>The Herald</em>, the announcement was of a Scottish first&#8212;a national allowance scheme for kinship carers, costing the Scottish Government up to &#163;20 million a year. The story<em> </em>went on to say that kinships carers who took on the parent/guardian role would be given the same status as foster carers across Scotland, and the minister proudly stated that the new programme was a joint commitment by the Scottish Government and COSLA. I presume that the media were briefed by the Scottish Government's spin doctors&#8212;spin that is now described as myth in the COSLA briefing that was sent to all MSPs yesterday.</p><p>COSLA can now&#8212;a year later&#8212;answer the questions that we asked on the day of the announcement. Its briefing helpfully outlines a number of questions and answers. First,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Does the commitment apply to all children who are looked after by friends and family?</p><p>The answer is no.</p><p>Secondly:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"How much will kinship carers get?\"</p><p>The answer is:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This will vary across Local Authorities\".</p><p>In response to the third question, which is \"What is the timescale?\" the answer is, \"over the period 2008-11\", and not&#8212;the minister will note&#8212;April 2008.</p><p>Finally,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Is there an issue with benefits?\"</p><p>The answer is yes. Is that a surprise? Despite all the ministers, all the officials at the back of the <place-holder colnum=\"13319\"/> chamber and all the brains in COSLA, we are told that not one of them was aware last year that there may be a problem. I think not&#8212;the spin needs to stop. The facts are that the First Minister said that the money was available and that the Minister for Children and Early Years said that he would deliver. The Parliament supported the minister in that goal, and it is time to deliver&#8212;no ifs, no buts.</p><p>There is a wider point. If the Scottish Government cannot deliver on its stated policy of increasing the number of places for children at risk, how can we have any confidence in its programme of action to improve the identification of children at risk? How can we believe that the Government will be able to build on the capacity of services for children at risk, strengthen the management of immediate risk and develop an evidence base if it cannot deliver for the minority of children&#8212;the tip of the iceberg&#8212;who have been identified as being at risk? How can we be confident that the Government can or will do any better for the 60,000 children under 16 who have a parent with a drug problem or the estimated&#8212;the Government does not even know the exact figure&#8212;10,000 to 20,000 children who live with a drug-using parent? Who knows where the remaining 40,000 are?</p><p>Finally, we need to establish who is in charge. To my knowledge, at least four cabinet secretaries&#8212;none of whom is present in the chamber&#8212;and three ministers have responsibility for kinship care. An important point is that not one of them is accountable to the Parliament for the issue&#8212;safety in numbers, indeed. Only when one of those cabinet secretaries with influence in the Government and over the budget is prepared to step forward to accept that responsibility and accountability will we know that the Scottish Government is serious about the protection of children.

The Local Government and Communities Committee was confirmed as the lead committee in consideration of the bill at stage 1 by vote of the Parliament on Wednesday 11 June 2008.</p><p>In all, 28 individuals and organisations responded to the committee's call for written evidence. The committee took oral evidence on the bill from witnesses at meetings in September and October 2008. Extracts from the <em>Official Reports </em>of the meetings and the associated written submissions are before members today in the committee's report. On behalf of the committee, I thank all those who willingly gave their time to give evidence and to participate in the process. I hope that I will be allowed to make a particular reference to the committee clerk, Martin Verity, who has prepared his last stage 1 report, as he will retire later this year. I am sure that all members wish him a happy and long retirement. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p>The evidence that we received showed that approximately 4.5 per cent of the Scottish population hold a blue badge parking permit, which translates into 230,000 people. As has been mentioned and I am sure will be mentioned again, the baywatch campaign in its most recent survey found that one in five parking bays is being used by drivers without a blue badge. That figure has remained depressingly constant over the years. The same survey found that more than a third of car parks have no accessible bays free for disabled shoppers because of the level of abuse. In evidence to the committee, Alex Thorburn of the Dumfries and Galloway access panel reported that his surveys of the local hospital car park regularly found that 50 per cent of accessible bays were taken up by non-badge holders. On one occasion, the figure rose to 75 per cent.</p><p>For someone with an impairment, the situation is more than an irritant and inconvenience; it represents a significant obstacle to undertaking the most mundane but important tasks, such as going to the shops, visiting the post office or attending the hospital. The need to act is outlined clearly in the evidence that the committee received. Jackie Baillie mentioned the written evidence from Leonard Cheshire Disability, which illustrated the organisation's full support for the bill. It stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For too long disabled people have had to rely on the courtesy and consideration of other drivers not to 'take' their reserved parking spaces, but we have all heard and seen news stories which depict the hostility other drivers now show each other when it comes to gaining a parking space.\"<place-holder colnum=\"12742\"/></p><p>We also heard from Jackie Baillie about that. The submission concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Therefore the age of just relying on politeness has ended and the age of enforcement has come.\"</p><p>The committee, while noting that the blue badge scheme is a United Kingdom scheme and is not within the scope of the bill, nevertheless believes that a wider approach to the issue of disabled persons' parking is required and that abuse of the blue badge scheme should be tackled. That may have further benefits in tackling crime generally. The evidence that was presented to the committee confirmed that people who break the rules in one part of their life are likely to break rules in other illegal ways. Research shows that those who are careless and thoughtless enough to take up a disabled parking bay are more likely to have a criminal record and that about 50 per cent of them have a history of traffic violations. Of the cars found abusing disabled spaces, one in 10 were in an illegal condition, whether through defective tyres or outdated road tax. That being the case, enforcement of disabled parking spaces may be an efficient and cost-effective way of targeting active offenders and illegal vehicles. Consequently, the committee calls on the Scottish Government to consider how the results of the Department for Transport's review of the operation of the scheme in England can best inform policy in Scotland.</p><p>One key proposal of the bill regarding on-street disabled persons' parking places that resulted in significant responses in evidence and subsequent debate is the requirement for each local authority to conduct a one-off audit of existing disabled parking spaces within 12 months of the act coming into force. There was wide variation in the estimated scale of the task and the possible resources required, perhaps reflecting the diversity of the local authorities that gave responses. While taking into account the difficulties that local authorities have in conducting an audit of their existing advisory disabled persons' parking bays, the committee agrees that a year after the act comes into force would normally be a reasonable length of time in which to have completed that exercise. The committee is also of the view that where exceptional circumstances prevent such an exercise being completed in time, the minister should be able to approve an extension.</p><p>The bill would require local authorities to seek to negotiate enforceable parking arrangements with owners of private car parks to which the public have access. It is the committee's view that the procedures for such negotiations should not result in an undue burden on those involved. The committee believes that working in partnership could bring benefits to those companies and have a significant effect on reducing the abuse of <place-holder colnum=\"12743\"/> disabled parking bays. The evidence that we heard from Asda, mentioned earlier by Jackie Baillie, gave an insight into what can be achieved. It would be fair to say that Asda is leading the way on that front with an enforcement scheme that has increased the availability of disabled parking spaces by 60 per cent. It has achieved that by introducing part-time parking attendants who can ask motorists to move on from disabled bays if they are not eligible to use them.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271268", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill was introduced by Jackie Baillie MSP on Monday 2 June 2008.

I see no reason why other supermarket chains are not following Asda's example. What are they waiting for?</p><p>The committee accepts the Finance Committee's view that more accurate costs could have been provided for the bill. We also endorse that committee's view that the overall estimate of &#163;1.7 million for promoting and implementing orders throughout Scotland is subject to significant doubt. The committee heard evidence about a wide range of costs associated with the implementation of the bill's provisions. Dundee City Council reported that it could convert 1,000 advisory bays into enforceable ones at a cost of &#163;196,000, while South Lanarkshire, with just 100 more bays than Dundee, believed that conversion would cost &#163;1 million. Glasgow City Council, which has 4,500 advisory bays, thinks that it will cost it &#163;2.1 million.</p><p>The committee agrees with the member in charge of the bill that some of the higher estimates of the work and associated costs might be avoided by adopting best practice. Only a thorough examination of the probable cost of implementing <place-holder colnum=\"12744\"/> the bill across local authorities could give an accurate picture. If the bill is passed, the committee expects that the Scottish Government will, in conjunction with COSLA, negotiate the costs of implementing the bill's provisions in a way that does not place an undue burden on local authorities.</p><p>On the basis of the report before Parliament, the committee recommends that the general principles of the bill be approved.</p>", "hdate": "2008-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14271268", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Persons' Parking Places (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sure that it is a commendable scheme and I have relatives who have benefited from disabled parking there.

As Bill Butler said, a new act will make it easier for mesolothemia victims and their families to be compensated properly. Another step in that direction will be taken if the general principles of the bill are agreed at decision time. If we go on to pass the bill, we will ensure that pleural plaques sufferers can pursue claims for damages.</p><p>We need to remember that the chamber can do that only with the support of Clydeside Action on Asbestos and our friends in the trade unions.

I stress the word \"easier\"; although we have made it less difficult for people to get compensation, we should remember that it is still not easy for them to do that.</p><p>On Monday, I made a statement&#8212;over the telephone, but I will sign it off later&#8212;to the legal representatives of a family in my constituency, one of whom is an ex-foreman with whom I worked.

A family had contacted me because they had had great difficulty in establishing a family member's work record. As these old pairt people do, Joe had kept records from 50 years ago. A phone call to my friend resulted in the branch contributions from 50 years ago&#8212;it was a delightful and satisfying moment. I could not wait to tell the family.</p><p>As I said, it is difficult to say anything new. I am delighted that we are making progress. We are discussing a measure that is not only historic in nature, as Gil Paterson alluded; people out there today are still being affected. It is worth noting for the record the hidden killer campaign that the Health and Safety Executive has mounted in recent weeks. The HSE is reminding us that asbestos continues to be a major problem&#8212;it is a hidden killer that takes the lives of 20 people a <place-holder colnum=\"12048\"/> week. More people die of asbestos-related disease in the UK than die in road accidents.</p><p>The campaign reminds us that, despite the fact that asbestos has been banned for a considerable time, people such as joiners and electricians are still being exposed to it. The HSE reckons that there are still 500,000 non-domestic buildings that contain asbestos. People out there continue to work in difficult circumstances. In addition to working on behalf of the victims of the past, parliamentarians have a role to play&#8212;with our friends in the trade unions and campaigners&#8212;in highlighting the dangers of the present.

Although there will be many differing views and personal experiences of the problems that marred the 2007 elections, it is clearly in everyone's interests that we do our best to avoid a repeat of the failures.</p><p>As members know, local government elections have been held simultaneously with the Scottish Parliament election since 1999. However, at the election last year, there were two significant changes: the single transferable vote system and electronic counting were both used for the first time. Having watched the events from close quarters, members will need no reminding of the problems that occurred that night. At an early stage, it became apparent that there was a high number of spoiled ballots&#8212;higher than normal&#8212;and that there were problems with the electronic counting machines. In some cases, the problems extended the count into the following day. In the Lothians count, they even led to suspension.</p><p>In the two previous local government elections that were tied to the Scottish parliamentary elections, the number of rejected ballot papers accounted for 0.77 per cent and 0.59 per cent of the overall votes cast. In 2007, the number was as high as 1.85 per cent. The rate of rejected ballots varied from 1.11 per cent in East Dunbartonshire to 2.77 per cent in West Dunbartonshire.</p><p>The number of rejected ballot papers in the local government elections was considerably smaller than the numbers involved in the parliamentary election, in which the rate of rejection was as high <place-holder colnum=\"11630\"/> as 4.07 per cent, but that should not be allowed to detract from the fact that the level of rejected ballot papers in the council elections was unacceptably high.</p><p>In light of the controversy that arose from the high level of rejected ballots, the Electoral Commission engaged Ron Gould, an international expert, to conduct an independent review. The resulting report was published in October last year and the Local Government and Communities Committee agreed to study its recommendations. The Scottish Affairs Committee of the House of Commons conducted its own inquiry into the Scottish parliamentary elections, and a report was published in May 2008.</p><p>Even though the remit of the Local Government and Communities Committee extended only to the local government elections, many of our findings will inevitably be relevant to the Scottish parliamentary election. We took oral evidence from Ron Gould in a videoconference; from the Electoral Commission; and from the Minister for Parliamentary Business, Bruce Crawford, and his officials. DRS Data Services&#8212;the company that provided the electronic equipment for counting ballot papers&#8212;did not accept an invitation to appear, much to our disappointment. However, the company did supply written information.</p><p>We published our report in June of this year. In the report, we examined all the areas covered by the Gould report that were relevant to local government, and we made a series of recommendations. The minister responded to our report in August, and I would like to thank him for the positive way in which he received the committee's recommendations.</p><p>One of the main areas covered in the Gould report was the need for a unified structure for managing elections in Scotland. Gould recommended the establishment of a chief returning officer, and he recommended that the returning officer function at local level should be professionalised. The committee agreed that a chief returning officer post for Scotland should be established to secure a co-ordinated and unified approach to elections held in Scotland. I am pleased that the minister responded positively to that recommendation, and I look forward to seeing the results of the Scottish Government's consultations on how things might be done.</p><p>A successful model for the approach is already well established in Northern Ireland, where Westminster retains full legislative responsibility. The model enjoys the confidence of the voters and the political parties, and the committee feels that it would be worth further investigation.</p><p>There appears to be general consensus across the Parliament on the proposal that future local <place-holder colnum=\"11631\"/> government elections should be decoupled from the Scottish Parliament election, so that they are not held on the same day. I want to make it clear that that would not guarantee that the problems experienced in May 2007 would not be repeated. However, the committee agreed that there would be organisational and administrative benefits as a consequence of less complex arrangements being required. Furthermore, decoupling the elections would enable attention to be focused more effectively on local issues.</p><p>However, the committee was conscious that there is concern about the level of turnout if elections are decoupled. There needs to be effective consultation and engagement with the electorate, effective research and more effective public information campaigns if the danger of lower turnout is to be avoided. The training of information officers should be more consistent and rigorous, and should include equalities awareness training.</p><p>If elections are to be decoupled, the committee recommends that the date of the next local elections should be determined by extending the current local government term, and the next, to five years each. Thereafter, local elections would revert to a four-year cycle.</p><p>Much has been said about the design of the Scottish Parliament ballot paper and the impact that it may have had on the level of spoiled papers. However, the high level of rejected ballots in the parliamentary election should not eclipse the high level of rejected ballots in the local government elections. The committee noted with concern that approximately 30,000 fewer people voted in the 2007 local government elections than in the Scottish parliamentary election, despite the elections being held simultaneously.</p><p>The committee had some concern that the lower level of rejected ballots in the local elections, compared with the Scottish Parliament elections, may have been due, in part, to voters believing that they had only one vote and so marking their local election ballot papers with an X or with a 1. Those papers will have been counted as valid, but it may be that some voters did not realise that they were able to vote for more than one candidate. Although it may not be possible to conduct research into whether that in fact happened in 2007, it remains a possibility that the wishes of some voters were not translated into correctly completed ballots. That reinforces the case for effective information campaigns.</p><p>The committee welcomes the Scottish Government's intention to examine the various options for ballot paper design and to consult on the options. The committee wishes to stress the importance of effective testing of the options for <place-holder colnum=\"11632\"/> ballot paper design, and wishes to be kept informed of progress on the research.</p><p>The committee recommends that those consulted on ballot paper design should include disability rights organisations. It is essential that the ballot paper design leads to a ballot paper that is easy to complete and is a fair reflection of the views of all voters.</p><p>Voter registration is also an issue. Although it was not covered in evidence to our inquiry, registration is also a reflection of engagement in the political process. There is a need for effective campaigning to increase electoral registration.</p><p>During the course of its inquiry, the committee welcomed research studies that had been conducted into rejected ballots for the parliamentary election. The studies explored the relationship between the level of rejected ballots and both social disadvantage and ballot paper design. I welcome the commitment given by the Minister for Parliamentary Business that the Scottish Government intends to introduce legislation that will allow post-election data to be released at polling station level for local elections. That will make it easier for variations of turnout by area to be examined more closely for local government elections.</p><p>Committee members' experience of participating as candidates in the 2007 elections was that the organisation of postal votes was inconsistent, even within constituencies, and that the support provided by information officers was variable. The committee noted in its report that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has raised concerns in its research that greater use of postal voting may make United Kingdom elections vulnerable to fraud. There is also the risk that systems of electoral administration may have reached breaking point as a result of pressures imposed in recent years.</p><p>Nevertheless, the committee acknowledged the value of the postal vote in allowing many more people to vote than would otherwise be the case. The committee recommends that the Scottish Government explores the greater use of postal voting as a means of improving voter participation, while bearing in mind the need to protect the integrity of the ballot. I welcome the Scottish Government's circulation of draft secondary legislation, which is intended to give effect to more secure postal ballots by means such as the introduction of personal identifiers. It is important that equalities considerations are taken into account as part of the process.</p><p>Accurate counting of votes is, of course, of paramount importance. That must be taken into account in any consideration of whether overnight counting should take place. Nevertheless, the <place-holder colnum=\"11633\"/> committee's preference was that the overnight count should be retained for local elections, if at all possible.</p><p>Members may agree that there was variation in the display of spoiled ballot papers on the night of the 2007 elections. If electronic counting is to be used in future local government elections, the committee considered that there should be agreed national standards on the display of spoiled ballot papers on screens at the count.</p><p>I have referred to equalities issues a number of times during my speech and the matter was a central theme of the committee's inquiry. The committee recommends that the elections steering group includes representation from equalities agencies and organisations in its membership. The committee also recommends that the Scottish Government considers whether further research is needed on promoting equalities within the electoral process.</p><p>My key message is that the voters themselves should be at the heart of our electoral system. In 2007, we got it wrong because the complex ballots and time-saving counting methods were there to make things easier for those of us involved in the political process, not necessarily for the voters.</p><p>We must remember that elections are not the plaything of politicians. Ron Gould has said on the record that voters were treated as an afterthought. Let us not make that mistake again. After all, what is the point of an electoral system if not to help as many voters as possible to exercise their democratic right? Everything else is secondary.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Local Government and Communities Committee's 8th Report, 2008 (Session 3): <em>Elections 2007</em> (SP Paper 120).</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Let me start by thanking the committee members, the clerks, the officers and the Scottish Parliament information centre for all their hard work and patience in putting together this report, which has allowed us to have this debate today.

We should ask&#8212;I admit to having been guilty of this&#8212;whether our focus on bricks and mortar, and on new hospitals and old hospitals, prevents us from shifting investment to areas in which it might help people to live longer and better lives.</p><p>Does reducing the cost of prescriptions really help the poor?

The cabinet secretary needs to work with the Parliament on this issue but, unfortunately, his style and presentation have prevented that.

He must put people such as Damian Muir's father, John Muir, at the heart of the sentencing council. He needs to give us confidence that when people are given community sentences, they will complete them, and that community sentences are not soft options or even that they are an option at all. He needs to ensure that when the mass prisoner releases that he proposes take place, the police will be properly resourced to deal with the results. Finally, he needs to guarantee that our communities will not bear the brunt of a flawed experiment.

However, I am glad that some members have cut through that to discuss our policy, born in the Scottish Parliament, for free personal care for the elderly in Scotland. We knew the consequences of adopting that policy, and we had debates about its sustainability.</p><p>The Parliament's health committees have been referred to. I was a member of the Health Committee away back in 2006. In that committee's reports, there was some good reading for the then Executive. We were satisfied with policy decisions and with their implementation. We acknowledged that the policy, born of this Parliament, provided greater security and dignity to many elderly people. Not only did it allow people to be looked after in a residential environment, it allowed more people to be looked after in their own homes. The policy gave great support to carers, and it reduced problems of delayed discharge.</p><p>However, not everything in the Health Committee's reports made for pleasant reading for the Executive. The committee included members of all parties: it was led by Roseanna Cunningham and Shona Robison served her time there, as well. There was also an independent member. However, committee members came to a unanimous view. I do not know whether we will ever achieve that under the present Administration; I do not know whether SNP back benchers will be as questioning of their own Government as the members of that committee were of the then Executive.</p><p>We raised significant questions in 2006, many of which have been debated in this chamber. They concerned the funding formula, delivery of services, food preparation and feeding, and raising standards of quality. However, I would like to focus on some other areas. Shona Robison expressed real concerns about the funding formula that was put in place by the then Scottish Executive and which is now being used by the Scottish Government. As I do, Shona Robison represents an area that has a declining population. As a consequence of that decline, the number of elderly people left in such communities is disproportionately high. That issue has to be focused on.</p><p>We do not need to have a fight with London, or to have a big argument to resolve problems. We can decide for ourselves that the funding formula is unfair to areas that have declining populations <place-holder colnum=\"8724\"/> and increasing numbers of elderly people who are seeking care.</p><p>I will use my constituency as an illustration. In Inverclyde, the proportion of people who are older than 65 is increasing. In 2004, it was estimated that nearly 14,000 people were aged 65 or over&#8212;17 per cent of the total population. The number of people aged 65 or over is expected to increase by approximately 25 per cent to 17,000. As the proportion of people aged 65 or over increases, the requirement for care home places and care-at-home services will obviously increase, too. Over the next four years, the number of people aged 65 or over is projected to increase by almost a third. That increase in the number of older people is coupled with a decline in the number of younger people. Those changes magnify problems in the size of the local pool of labour that can look after older people, and in the size of the local pool of younger informal carers. In my community, the carers of people who are very elderly&#8212;the over 80s&#8212;are now reaching ages at which they themselves need to be looked after.</p><p>We are not talking about a problem that is far away; it is right on our doorstep and it affects several communities. I received a very constructive response from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth earlier today, when he assured me that he would consider all these issues and would ensure that we do not simply provide a blanket solution across Scotland, but take account of the fact that some communities face a disproportionate impact in looking after their elderly people. Those communities suffer from significant underfunding at present. I ask the ministers and cabinet secretary in the health portfolio to give a similar commitment to recognise that certain communities have significant and serious problems and to address those communities' needs as soon as possible.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13660353", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Free Personal Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is unsurprising that the debate has focused mainly on the fight over the \u00a330 million of attendance allowance money, which will not in itself make our ambitions for our elderly people sustainable, although there is no doubt that it would plug a gap.

After five months, delivery is well under way. Community ownership has allowed a real focus on Inverclyde's housing needs.

Rents are capped by the retail prices index for five years, with the aim of holding them to that for 14 years.

I will set those out as briefly as I can. On Thursday 29 November 2007, Aberdeenshire Council's infrastructure services committee refused consent for the Trump Organization's planned development at Menie estate. On Monday 3 December, the First Minister met representatives of the Trump Organization, at their request. At 2.20 pm on Tuesday 4 December, the chief planner met representatives of the Trump Organization, at their request. At 3.45 on the same day, the chief planner phoned the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth recommending that the application be called in; the cabinet secretary agreed. At 5 pm on the same day, the application was called in. Cynics might say that Trump said, \"Jump!\" and the First Minister of Scotland said, \"How high?\" The committee's task was to examine how and why the decisions that I have described were taken. We examined, to quote our inquiry's remit,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the decision-making process of ministers and officials, the legal advice relied upon and the transparency of their actions.\"</p><p>As controversial as the application was, the decision to hold the inquiry was not&#8212;it was supported by the whole committee, various experts and even the First Minister. Only when scrutiny started to bite and committee members started to ask hard questions did the spin machine launch its campaign to denigrate the committee and its work, in a way that was unprecedented in <place-holder colnum=\"7955\"/> the history of the Scottish Parliament. I am confident that we will hear more of that today.</p><p>We had the First Minister negotiating with the committee about when, how and for how long he would give evidence. He even tried to vet the questions that we would be allowed to ask. We exchanged letters with the Trump Organization's lawyers about whether its representatives would appear to give evidence. Civil servants sent the permanent secretary to try to restrict what we could ask officials and how officials would answer. The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 even had to be used to compel the release of certain documents. Two hundred and forty pieces of information were provided to the committee only after it had reported.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the report nonetheless sets out what we managed to discover. What evidence did we finally hear about how the application was called in? We heard that the call-in decision was taken on the back of two short telephone calls between the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, John Swinney, and the chief planner. John Swinney is notable by his absence today.</p>", "hdate": "2008-04-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13402996", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning Application Processes (Menie Estate)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the clerks and officials who supported us in our work for their support and patience throughout the process.

Should we conclude that they are hardly in line with a \"precautionary approach\" and that it is not a wise move for a First Minister to leave himself and his Government open to accusations of irregular practice?

There is a recognised need to increase the availability of care places through fostering and kinship care. By such means, we can improve these children's life chances. In short, we must be able to meet the increased demand for children's services on all fronts.</p><p>I share NCH's concern that if adequate resources are not provided we will be unable to tackle this issue effectively. A national fostering and kinship care strategy is long overdue: the carers in question are the least supported, the least well trained, the least well paid, the least inspected and the most isolated of all child care workers. As a result, we need to understand what new money is being made available. How many carers will benefit? What social work assessment will be required? Who will meet the cost of those assessments? Given the current workload of social workers and child services, is the capacity that other members have mentioned available in the system? As Christine Grahame wondered, will the allowance impact on other benefits that carers <place-holder colnum=\"4103\"/> receive&#8212;particularly as many of them are elderly grandparents who receive, for example, housing benefit? Finally, will the benefit be available in all local authorities?</p><p>Such questions need to be answered clearly. If the Government&#8212;with the cross-party support that it has secured today&#8212;announces this initiative and creates the expectation among carers that they will receive this allowance only for them to find out that they cannot access it locally or that there are other barriers to receiving it, it will be a cruel deception indeed. Worse still, what if children's services, which are currently underfunded, come under additional pressure, resulting in many children having to continue to live with parental drug abuse? The minister knows from our regular correspondence that I feel strongly about this matter. At the moment, these children do not have their needs assessed, never mind met. What if this measure overburdens existing services and means that people who are in greater need slip further down the priority list? Is it simply a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul?</p><p>We cannot criticise the intent behind the strategy, as it aims to help carers and increase opportunities and real alternatives for young children who live in difficult family circumstances, but we cannot and must not introduce unintended consequences. We must not allow it to be detrimental to other children who face similar circumstances.</p><p>I agree that the scale of the drug problem and its impact on families and children is massive. Indeed, previous Administrations and the Government have described tackling the problem as a priority. Christine Grahame is not here, but the priority that it is given was proved only last week when three cabinet secretaries gave evidence to her committee&#8212;the Health and Sport Committee&#8212;on the impact of drugs on society. Indeed, four cabinet secretaries and, to my knowledge, three ministers, are involved in the area. As a result, I am concerned that the number of ministers who are involved will be a problem rather than a solution. That said, I am confident that ministers agree with the chair of the Scottish Association of Alcohol and Drug Action Teams, Tom Wood, who said during a Health and Sport Committee evidence session:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need to invest in young people and families.

I start with a confession: I was not born at Stobhill, or even in Glasgow. However, I visited Stobhill hospital on many occasions in my role as a trade union official representing people there. I was also a member of the then Health Committee when, under the convenership of Roseanna Cunningham, we examined car parking charges.</p><p>I am pleased to see the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing at a members' debate. That does not often happen and it is worth noting.</p><p>The anger that has been generated by this issue at Stobhill, at Inverclyde royal hospital and at other hospitals in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board area is as high as we have seen anywhere else. There have been protests, and petitions have attracted massive support. Unfortunately, industrial action is threatened. I have read the cabinet secretary's public statements and I am sure that she is working to prevent the situation going that far.</p><p>We have had review after review, which just will not do. We have been given guidelines, criteria <place-holder colnum=\"3401\"/> and&#8212;supposedly&#8212;the right to consultation on the impact of car parking charges. Although most people would agree that charges should not be a profit-making exercise, I concede that some hospitals have suffered from abuse of their car parks. Such abuse has to be tackled, but I do not know that charges are the right way to do so.</p><p>Safety and security issues have to be addressed when they arise. However, for Stobhill, the Inverclyde royal and other hospitals, a case-by-case, hospital-by-hospital consultation before the introduction of car parking charges is essential. Many hospitals in the west of Scotland are in different situations. This is not a dodge&#8212;people in Inverclyde are not suggesting that it is okay to introduce charges at the Glasgow royal infirmary or other Glasgow hospitals. People from my part of the world use all those hospitals, and we have the additional burden of the cost of the journey to get to them. However, there is a double whammy in that if we get a friend to take us there, we have to face car parking charges as well.</p><p>It is a scandal that car parking charges will be rolled out across the health board area&#8212;and particularly in the IRH&#8212;without consultation. No one has consulted the local community, no one has consulted the local authority, no one has consulted the local users groups and no one has consulted people in the neighbourhood. I ask the cabinet secretary to use her powers and to insist that a full and proper consultation take place, so that issues can at least be aired.</p><p>In June 2006, the Health Committee raised the issue of access&#8212;another issue that angers me. We are pushing ahead with car parking charges in and around our hospitals, but I see no such enthusiasm for dealing with the general issues of travel access to hospitals and health centres throughout the west of Scotland. There is no guidance on how health boards and various other agencies should deal with access. How soon will it be before the health board moves on to consider charging for the use of car parks at health centres as well?

Committee conveners&#8212;who have now left the chamber&#8212;have expressed what I presume are personal views that Labour's proposals would be detrimental to the work of the <place-holder colnum=\"3189\"/> Parliament's committees. My view is that that would not be the case; our proposals would complement committee work.</p><p>The reaction from the SNP this morning is depressing, but not surprising for a party that, in Government, has studiously avoided parliamentary accountability. SNP members are in denial that they are in Government, and they have tried to avoid that accountability week in, week out. That is understandable&#8212;their manifesto was one of promises and bribes that do not bear scrutiny.</p><p>There have been press briefings outside the Parliament about new policy initiatives, and vanity debates, rather than real ones. The SNP prefers backroom deals with other parties, which exclude members, including members of the party of Government. Are there any SNP back benchers here who can tell me what their ministers and whips have been discussing with the Greens and the Tories? Such discussions exclude not just the Parliament as a whole, but SNP back benchers, who meekly accept a situation that demeans their position as parliamentarians.</p><p>There are cross-cutting departments. For example, four Cabinet secretaries and three ministers have some responsibility for drugs policy, yet not one of those Cabinet secretaries or ministers is actually accountable for drugs policy.</p><p>How far we have travelled since the early days of this session, when we heard from the First Minister a recognition that we are all minorities in the Parliament and warm words describing a new politics. That was commendable, but is now forgotten. It was commendable in being consistent with the founding principles of the Parliament: access, participation, accountability and power sharing. The Parliament encourages all members to play a part in applying those principles through the full range of their work. This debate is entirely consistent with those founding principles&#8212;with the sharing of power between the people of Scotland, the legislators and the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government should be accountable to the Scottish Parliament; the Scottish Parliament should be accountable, open and responsive. It should develop procedures that make possible a participative approach to the development, consideration and scrutiny of policy and legislation.</p><p>We are faced, however, with a Government that indulges in so much trickery and sleight of hand that it should be led by Paul Daniels.

The legacy that asbestos has left is not a historical one&#8212;it is important that we bear in mind that asbestos is responsible for more work-related deaths in this country than any other cause. Mesothelioma, the cancer that is induced by asbestos exposure, is the third fastest-increasing cancer in Britain, and the figure is not expected to peak until between 2010 and 2015. Legal battles to expose the impact of asbestos on its victims and their families, and to ensure that justice is done, have taken place over decades. It seems that they are set to continue, given the determination of the employers and the insurance companies to unpick the rights that asbestos victims and their families currently have.</p><p>There have been some successes&#8212;not least here in the Scottish Parliament&#8212;that were mentioned earlier. It is worth saying yet again that excellent cross-party work has been done by members of the Parliament. That includes our late colleague Margaret Ewing&#8212;not only in this Parliament, but in the Westminster Parliament; Mary Scanlon, who was here earlier; Stewart Stevenson; Bill Aitken; the members of the previous Justice 1 Committee, who did a sterling job under the convenership of my colleague Pauline McNeill; and Hugh Henry, in his previous role as Deputy Minister for Justice. Last, but not least, I am sure that members will acknowledge the sterling and consistent work that has been done with the unions and the campaigners by Des McNulty.

Ministers, as <place-holder colnum=\"3145\"/> we know&#8212;and as we have heard from Hugh Henry&#8212;have the power to act. The emergency powers procedure was created for situations such as this, in which a bill must be passed swiftly to close a legal loophole or right a wrong that has been created by a court judgment. That is precisely the set of circumstances that we face.</p><p>I urge the minister to take the necessary first step, and introduce the ready-made bill that he has in his possession.

There has been a 13 per cent increase in the number of children on the child protection register, and there has been a worrying rise in the number of unborn children, babies and toddlers whose lives are endangered by parental drug addiction. The biggest rise was among unborn babies&#8212;a 72 per cent increase&#8212;and the scale of the problem continues to increase. I believe that 80 per cent of children whose parents abuse drugs are no longer living with those parents.</p><p>In considering capacity to deal with the problem, we have to recognise the roles of foster carers. They play a great role in providing a safe haven and support for parents in crisis. It cannot help that the support that those foster carers get differs from one local authority to the next. How can we build capacity when we send negative messages like that? Foster carers are part of a solution to deal with an ever-growing and serious problem.</p><p>Foster carers are, however, only part of the solution to the growing problem: members have mentioned today the role of grandparents, the extended family and the adoption services when we need to rescue children from the direst of circumstances and give them a place of safety where they can be nurtured for their future.</p><p>Like most members, I have a grandparents group in my area&#8212;it is right that we mention them in debates such as this. As the minister will know&#8212;he has taken an interest in the matter&#8212;the <place-holder colnum=\"2653\"/> issues that those groups have are not solely about money, although there is a grievance about that: they are at the wrong time of their life and they find difficulty in seeing young children through their education.</p><p>There is also a difficulty in respect of the relationships with social workers, who sometimes see grandparents as interfering when they try to intervene in the interests of the children. Grandparents are also aggrieved that social workers turn up when the children's parents have been jailed and ask them to take the children. If the grandparents rush in and prevent the situation from worsening, they are left with the children and given only basic support, which is not acceptable. Such stories have been told to me by the women to whom I have spoken. They are not anti-drugs and do not want to victimise drug addicts, but they are living with the reality of having a child who is a drug addict who has children.</p><p>When the grandparents try to get some certainty into the young person's life&#8212;as opposed to the to-ing and fro-ing, the yo-yo system of going back and forth between the parents and the grandparents&#8212;and move legally to adopt the child, they receive the final insult. It can cost them, on fixed incomes and with limited means, &#163;2,000 to adopt their grandchild, to take them out of their misery and give some permanence to their life. Also, the addict can then suddenly become interested not in the child, but in the benefits that they recognise will move with the child to the grandparent when their legal status changes. Those issues are important to grandparents and to the fostering service, whom the minister recognises are part of a solution.</p><p>We must act to identify and protect such children and, when necessary, we must take them out of the homes that are doing them harm. We must have the capacity&#8212;through fostering, adoption and kinship care&#8212;to give those children the opportunities that we want for them.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389938", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fostering (Support)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Christine Grahame for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue.

Because of its impact on communities and families right across Scotland, no issue is more important for us to discuss. Who could argue with the view that we should reach a political consensus on how to deal with the issue? However, our views on how to deal with it sometimes differ.</p><p>The current methadone programme is a key part of the harm-reduction approach to drug abuse. It was supposed to stop addicts dying, but drug-related deaths have continued to rise&#8212;up by 25 per cent last year. It was supposed to get addicts off drugs by providing a legal substitute, but 70 per cent of those on methadone are still getting their illegal hits anyway. It was supposed to cut drug-related crime, but 80 per cent of addicts on methadone are still committing crimes, and our prisons are full of inmates with drug addictions.</p><p>We have to grasp this issue. Members may not all agree, but I feel that by making drug use affordable and acceptable, current policies are conspiring to keep addicts in what&#8212;over generations in some cases&#8212;has become a way of life. The sad fact behind recent reported deaths is that some of those people were not our children but our grandparents. The harm-reduction approach has increased the risk for our children and our communities. Therefore, calls for \"more support\" or \"more of the same\" will not help. We have heard such calls from members this morning.</p><p>Is the answer not to challenge the lack of ambition that saw stabilisation as the only realistic policy goal? We have to move towards cessation schemes. We have to challenge drug-taking behaviour and have a clear ambition&#8212;as Stuart McMillan said earlier&#8212;to get as many people as we can back to their families, back to work and back into the community.</p><p>We have to acknowledge that some people who take drugs have multiple problems. However, whether we accept it or not, there are also people who like drugs and choose to take them. That behaviour has to be challenged. Those people are not the only innocent victims; the child, the neighbour and the parent of the addict are the victims as well.</p><p>If the Executive is intent on setting up another consultation, that is a worthy intention. If we can reach a consensus on how to challenge the present situation, that will be great. However, I give members a reminder&#8212;as if it were needed&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"1469\"/> about how the children of drug-abusing parents find their way on to the priority lists. The reminder is from the recently published letters of assurance that the Executive sought from local authorities. Those letters reveal that any number of children in Scotland may be living&#8212;unidentified and unprotected&#8212;in the squalor of parental drug addiction.</p><p>Among the correspondence is a submission in which Strathclyde Police chief constable Sir Willie Rae and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde chief executive Tom Divers concede that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"At this present time, we could not provide general assurance that all children affected by substance misuse have been identified.\"</p><p>Those men are very senior figures delivering services in our communities.</p><p>However, that is just the tip of the iceberg. The Executive's own summary acknowledges that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the vast majority of ... areas experience difficulty in consistently identifying those children affected by drug misuse.\"</p><p>That was reported by child protection committees.</p><p>In Inverclyde, the past council leader Alan Blair acknowledged that children were living in such circumstances. He admitted that their safety could not be guaranteed. In North Lanarkshire, a report signed off by council, health and police chiefs states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We cannot provide a definitive guarantee that all children who ... have parents who are misusing substances have been identified.\"</p><p>Senior figures in South Lanarkshire assert that the reason why</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is never possible to be entirely confident in relation to the identification of all children ... affected by parental drug use\"</p><p>is that drug users are hidden from services. However, precisely where those self-sufficient drug addicts&#8212;who have never accessed housing benefit, child benefit, council tax benefit, a general practitioner, a social worker, the housing department or any other public service&#8212;are to be found is, alas, not divulged.</p><p>I could go on, but time is limited and I am sure that members get the picture. Children are being failed by a system that does not even see them as a statistic. Local authorities have been given a clear duty by the Executive to ensure that addicts' children get the services they need before they are at risk of harm. However, as has now been revealed by the letters of assurance, local authorities are nothing like able to meet that obligation.</p><p>The inability to identify, far less protect, a significant number of children and young people is <place-holder colnum=\"1470\"/> not only creating much needless suffering but risking another child's preventable death. I therefore renew my call to the minister&#8212;whether it be Shona Robison, Fergus Ewing, Kenny MacAskill, Adam Ingram, or whoever can be put in post specifically to deal with this issue&#8212;to act now. There are no excuses and there can be no delay.

I am sure that she and her colleagues will take into account the impact of the closure of the midwife-led unit on the maternity strategy, not just in Inverclyde but in Scotland.</p><p>However, I want to return to deprivation&#8212;and it is worth considering why it is that in communities where there is high deprivation, there is lower use of midwife-led maternity units. All the issues that I mentioned conspire against us and divert us from the focus that I believe the Parliament and the new Government should have on health inequalities. The big issue explored by Professor David Kerr was poor life expectancy and the long-standing illness that affects Scotland's most disadvantaged people. That has been described this morning as Scotland's shame. Hand wringing goes on about the reports that are regularly published, but it is difficult to act.<place-holder colnum=\"1246\"/></p><p>As the cabinet secretary and others mentioned, there have been some improvements in life expectancy&#8212;good news, we might think&#8212;but yet again those figures show that the more affluent have benefited. The gap is widening, not narrowing. I am sure that there is broad agreement on the reasons for that&#8212;members have touched on how life circumstances relate to health, unemployment, poor housing and poor education. We have also spoken about bad lifestyle choices, such as alcohol, drugs, poor exercise and diet, but I will focus on access to primary health care services and the difference that such services can make. It used to be considered that health care services did not have a significant impact on people's health. With medical advances, it is recognised that access to effective health care can have a significant impact. Evidence to the Health Committee in April 2006 recognised that 30 to 50 per cent of the gap in life expectancy results from reduced access to health care. If we improve access, we can improve people's life chances.</p><p>There is a high uptake of health services by people living in deprived areas. The question, however, is whether it is high enough to meet the needs of those communities. Indeed, is the care that is being made available to them appropriate to their needs? The same number of GPs serve the poorest 20 per cent as serve the top 20 per cent. GPs in deprived areas are running to stand still. They deal with more people with more problems. As a consequence, poor people spend less time with their GP, are less likely to be referred to a consultant or to receive in-patient care, are more likely to receive emergency care, are less likely to get appropriate medicine and manage their health properly and are less likely to have their children immunised.</p><p>The question is how we respond to that challenge. Behavioural change campaigns can actually widen health inequalities, because more affluent people are more likely to take up the advice. The gap is not narrowing and the situation will get worse unless we do something about it. Improving individual circumstances and providing better education, jobs and housing can make a change, but that takes time. We must surely recognise that the quickest way to make an impact on health inequalities is to target services in the most disadvantaged areas. We should be prepared to take a radical step to enhance access to health services for the disadvantaged.</p><p>I do not think that that is an easy ask for the Parliament. Rather than forming another task force or group, I recommend the report of the Kerr sub-group on health inequalities as essential reading. The case for change is there. The case is outlined for moving resources to meet the need that is there, concentrated not just in the west of Scotland <place-holder colnum=\"1247\"/> but on some streets and in some neighbourhoods in all our communities.

When discussing that point at the cross-party group earlier this week, I spoke to Tom Kelly, the chief executive of the Association of Scotland's Colleges.

On the other hand, everyone loves a holiday&#8212;even at the end of November, when it is dark and miserable and we are saving for Christmas.</p><p>There was always going to be a debate about the economic advantages or disadvantages of the proposal and that issue is still up in the air. There is also an argument about whether we should celebrate St Andrew, a Christian saint who never set foot in Scotland, on the ground that that is hardly inclusive. That said, I am of the view that we should use a national day as an opportunity to celebrate Scotland and Scotland's diversity. We have at least heard some ideas&#8212;from Alex Neil, Donald Gorrie and others&#8212;about working together to make it an exciting day, on which to celebrate the best of Scotland.</p><p>Whether an additional holiday is necessary is still debatable. It would hardly be an inclusive national celebration if various sections of the population did not get the holiday. What sort of celebration would it be for low-paid workers in the private sector, who already have the lowest holiday entitlement? Some would say that such a celebration would allow the gap to grow between the people at the top, who get the holidays, and the people at the bottom. What is clear from today's debate is that we are not in any way <place-holder colnum=\"28077\"/> addressing discrimination against the low paid with regard to working time, holiday entitlement and work-life balance. To suggest that that is what we are doing is not to take the issue seriously. Two million people in the UK&#8212;tens of thousands of them in Scotland&#8212;do not receive any public holidays. If we really wish to end the discrimination that divides our workforce, we must end the practice of excluding low-paid workers from public holidays and making them take them as part of their annual leave.</p><p>Stewart Maxwell has been the workers' champion here today. Continuing his theme, I am pleased to say that the Labour Party takes those issues seriously. It has a proud record in that respect and, for the first time ever, has addressed legal rights to annual holidays in the United Kingdom. There is the working time directive and maternity and paternity leave. As we would expect&#8212;and as Susan Deacon alluded to&#8212;we are going further. Working with business and trade unions, we will ensure that those who do not receive bank holidays will receive those extra eight days' paid holiday as a right.</p><p>Stewart Maxwell says that the SNP will campaign on the basis of an extra day's holiday. The campaign slogan from Labour will easily match that: \"One day for the favoured few with the SNP; eight days for all with Labour\". Of course, we can guarantee those rights only through Westminster. The SNP may say that it could give workers the same, or perhaps even more, but in the chaos of separatism would it be in a position to offer workers the rights that they deserve? As Jim Mather and I know, it is the bosses, not the workers, who determine employment policies in the SNP. If the SNP ever comes to power, will it guarantee that workers will not lose out on the eight days' extra paid holidays that they would get if they were still in the UK, or will it continue to give more to those who have most and lock out the have-nots, on the basis of some spurious competitive example in the chaos that would follow separation?</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368213", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will not spare Dennis Canavan's blushes.

I think that the Scottish Parliament has a good record of recognising the plight of asbestos workers and their campaign for justice, which has been ably supported by many members in the chamber, but particularly by my colleague Des McNulty.</p><p>In November 2000, we had a members' business debate in my name that focused on the actions of the insurance companies on the asbestos issue. There was a long struggle in days gone by during which they made no apology. They delayed and delayed until a person died, in order to avoid paying compensation. Of course, we changed that situation, but the insurance companies then changed their tactics to one of blanket denial&#8212;justice delayed became justice denied. They drew out procedures for months and years to deny the paying of compensation. Victims were denied their very existence. For example, they were asked to prove that they had served their time and worked in a shipyard. They were also asked to prove, for example, that the Queen Elizabeth II was built in John Brown's shipyard. That was all done to deny the victims the justice that they deserved. What an insult and what an injury, on top of having a terminal disease and facing death, to be questioned about their very existence.</p><p>We have had other crises along the way. We had the collapse of Chester Street Insurance Holdings Ltd, which bankrupted itself to avoid paying compensation, while paying its top bosses million-pound bonuses. Thankfully, some possible consequences of that situation for victims were avoided. Again, however, victims facing death were worried about whether they would receive a penny in compensation. We have also had other recent setbacks, including the most recent legal decision, which brings us here today, by which 90 per cent of the compensation that victims deserve was put under threat.<place-holder colnum=\"27058\"/></p><p>The insurance companies' tactics have been ruthless and consistent. They have used all methods possible to frustrate and deny justice for the victims. We should remind ourselves of what we are talking about, as others have said during the debate. We are talking about people who are cancer victims. It is a very aggressive cancer that takes their lives away in very difficult circumstances in around 18 months or two years. Given such circumstances, we as a Parliament, both politicians and law officers, have faced up to the situation and focused on the needs of the victims rather than on the will of the insurance companies.</p><p>It is great news today for people whom I know in my constituency that we are making these decisions. We have had the intervention in the Chester Street crisis and, thankfully, we have had justice fast tracked for victims in Scotland. Pauline McNeill, who sends apologies for not being present, did a lot of work to make that happen. Of course, we are also having today the reversal of the law lords ruling that would have denied the victims justice, and we can expect a forthcoming bill that will address the issue of the victims' families.</p><p>It is sweet justice indeed when a situation has been created whereby the insurance companies and the employers will have to sue one another rather than the victims of asbestos&#8212;hear, hear, and well done!

We are still beset by the strange one-size-fits-all approach. Out-of-date funding formulas and notional equal access to general practitioners has resulted in healthy, affluent areas having the same concentration of doctors as do the poorest pockets of public health. That results in poor sick people having less time with GPs; being less likely to be referred to a consultant; being more likely to be seen in an overburdened, single-doctor practice; being more likely to be seen by a younger doctor who has never been in a deprived community before in his life; and being more likely to die younger.

Why are we in a situation where so many of those who are addicted to drugs are having children? We know from the document and from reality that there are dangers such as HIV and AIDS and dangers to the mother and child from difficult pregnancies. We are talking about people with long-term addictions. Susan Deacon gave us some ideas on how we can tackle the problem, but as a first step we need to explore putting an oral contraceptive in methadone. In that way, we could reduce the problem and prevent some children from coming to harm.

However, when those working people have taken up new employment, Alex Neil's colleague Christine Grahame has denigrated them for doing so. People have sought to move on from the traditional industries; they are working hard to create lives for themselves and to provide good homes and so on for their families, yet the SNP denigrates them for doing so. Alex Neil cannot give me any lectures.</p><p>Tory members may be smiling, but Patrick Harvie got it right when he said that when tens of thousands of jobs are taken out of a community, the result is problems such as those that we have in my area. That is what happens, irrespective of the political leadership in the area. The job is a difficult one, but it is one that we are determined to tackle.</p><p>The Clyde corridor is to become a national priority and a massive investment&#8212;&#163;1.5 billion&#8212;will go into it as a result. The Tories refuse to welcome any of the investment. In their amendment, they seek to remove the word <place-holder colnum=\"23638\"/> \"welcomes\". As the minister pointed out, regional priorities have been set for areas such as Inverclyde and North Ayrshire, which will continue to face the challenges to which I alluded earlier. I call those problems the three Ds: deindustrialisation, depopulation and deprivation. Both those areas have great potential and I invite members, including Christine Grahame, to come and see the potential for themselves. Anyone who comes to Inverclyde will see it. The river that used to be the success of the past can become our future. That is why someone who is even as hard to please as I am welcomes the initiative.</p><p>The announcement that Inverclyde and Irvine bay are to get their own urban regeneration companies is important. I say to Donald Gorrie that, instead of top-down objectives being imposed, those companies will work to promote confidence and to support communities in delivering their objectives. I hope that those companies will generate the confidence that will encourage investment and move us forward. I think that they will deliver on the ground by sealing the deals and bringing benefits.</p><p>A question that was never far below the surface in some speeches is the one that is posed in dysfunctional families: \"Where's the money?\" It has been acknowledged that we can draw on massive amounts of private investment. To be fair, the Executive has shown its determination to provide statutory funding&#8212;it is in there for the long term. I am sure that the Executive is determined to succeed. If I may focus on my community, Scottish Enterprise Renfrewshire has committed &#163;10 million to the Inverclyde regeneration programme.</p><p>However, the First Minister made it clear in yesterday's announcement on regeneration that the issue is about not just money, but about changing how we work so that we ensure that a joined-up approach across Executive departments and agencies supports local action. Karen Whitefield, Donald Gorrie and Susan Deacon mentioned that. \"Partnership working\" and \"joined-up government\" are overused phrases, but they are not meaningless just because they can be used inappropriately. Genuine partnership working is not about throwing together a group of agencies and departments that have their own agendas and interests and which will negotiate themselves into a stalemate; it is about operating in concert, which requires real leadership, as the regeneration policy statement acknowledges.</p><p>I am under pressure for time, so I will move on quickly. If communities like mine are to share in Scotland's increased prosperity, concerted efforts are needed at all levels. The policy that we are discussing will tackle the hard problems that Patrick Harvie described. It will give communities a real chance in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356859", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Those areas are the traditional Labour heartlands where people followed traditional employment patterns for many years.

All those who are responsible for them should be congratulated.</p><p>The minister made the point that waiting lists were not slashed by accident. That achievement is due, at least in part, to the record investment and modernisation programme that the Executive has delivered and that the SNP and others have opposed tooth and nail. However, there is a limit to what politicians can do. We can invest in the national health service and ensure that structures allow that investment to be put to best use, but results on the ground are delivered only by the determined efforts of national health service staff to provide the sort of service that their patients deserve.</p><p>I will pick one example. Mr John Morrice, a consultant surgeon at Inverclyde royal hospital, which is in my constituency, spoke in the Health Committee's public debate \"Reshaping the NHS in Scotland?\" in April last year, when he described himself as \"one of those dinosaurs\" who provides a general surgical service. Dinosaur or not, thanks to his efforts and the efforts of those who work with and around him, the waiting times for breast cancer patients at Inverclyde royal hospital are, as he recently pointed out in the local press, the lowest in Scotland, while the waiting times for colorectal cancer patients are the sixth lowest. People in my constituency are alive today because of the Executive's policies. It does not get any bigger than that.</p><p>That is not a frivolous point. In an area such as Inverclyde, which still suffers from poor public health, those are substantial achievements. They should be given the credit that they deserve and should not be sneered at by Opposition politicians who have never run much more than a bath. The results that were announced today are a testament to effective partnership working between the Executive and health service professionals.</p><p>There is no complacency about the challenges that we face in meeting the expectations of those whom we represent. I have been critical. I have pressed ministers and I will continue to press them on waiting times, digital hearing aids and other matters, but today of all days we have an opportunity to come together, unite and celebrate <place-holder colnum=\"23548\"/> the success of the Scottish health service. Too many members in the chamber missed that opportunity.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356643", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the SNP members who were able to turn up today.

For example, can we give employers responsibility for building training into the working day? Can we increase the rights of individuals to training and education throughout their lives? If we remove the barriers, should we also consider the responsibility of the workforce to use those rights? Should they take responsibility for ensuring that they have today's skills and will be able to learn tomorrow's?

Moreover, they came to believe that structures were part of the problem. The minister's announcement in May that he was to put NHS Argyll and Clyde out of its misery was as welcome as it was inevitable.</p><p>The minister was left with little choice. Over several years and under a series of management regimes, the board attempted to force through a string of ill-conceived reorganisation plans, its books were in a mess and, more important, it had lost the trust of those it served. Abolishing the board and pledging to write off its accumulated &#163;80 million debt has, therefore, been warmly welcomed in my constituency. That move will, as I said in my submission to the consultation, tackle the two issues that cause the most difficulty for health services in my constituency: geography and debt.</p><p>Geographically, it never made sense to have a health board that tried to balance the competing interests of remote and urban communities&#8212;it certainly does not now. Writing off the debt means, I hope, that the new board can start planning services with a clean slate and with nothing but the quality of patient care to consider.</p><p>What of the new board? The minister announced today that health services in my constituency will come under the management of NHS Greater Glasgow. That is to be welcomed for a number of reasons. First, if we are serious about reducing inequalities, tackling the pockets of appalling public health in urban west central communities such as my own must be our priority. NHS Greater Glasgow has expertise in doing that. Moving health services in Greenock and Inverclyde to NHS Greater Glasgow will allow a focus to be put squarely on tackling those persistent, serious health problems as well as the high incidence of premature death.</p><p>Secondly, moving services to NHS Greater Glasgow reflects what happens in practice: many <place-holder colnum=\"21636\"/> of my constituents who require highly specialised care have, for many years, received it in hospitals in Glasgow. Today's announcement also means that our health services will be provided by a board that boasts university-led acute services. It should not face the same recruitment and retention challenges that NHS Argyll and Clyde did. It follows that, with flexible working, that can allow acute services in Inverclyde access to a wider pool of clinical staff. In these days of reduced working hours, and royal college training requirements and guidelines, such a pool is essential to maintain near-patient local services. Furthermore, joining with NHS Greater Glasgow can deliver a strategic focus for the provision of services across all west central Scotland and make the best use of resources.</p><p>Although I have no wish to tread on the toes of members who represent other communities in the Argyll and Clyde area, I do have an interest in patient flows from outside my constituency. If the principle of patient choice is to remain&#8212;and people on the Cowal peninsula have made it clear that they wish to continue to have services delivered at Inverclyde royal hospital&#8212;we have to ask whether patient flows can be maintained. We would certainly hope so.</p><p>Notwithstanding all the benefits that I believe will come from this change, my constituents have certain expectations of NHS Greater Glasgow. There is an obvious need to create stability in local health services. For too long, it has been a question of what would go and what could stay. The future of Inverclyde royal hospital must be confirmed and alternative proposals to NHS Argyll and Clyde's discredited clinical strategy must be introduced as quickly as possible. Those alternatives must be acceptable to the community and to the clinicians. To achieve that, they must be consistent with the model proposed in the Kerr report. In other words, we must deliver services as locally as possible and as specialist as necessary.</p>", "hdate": "2005-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13351852", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health Services (Argyll and Clyde)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No one in my community is naive enough to believe that structures in themselves will solve all a community's problems.

What do we have here today? We certainly do not have a political conspiracy. I do not recognise what we have tried to do today as an attempt to do down back benchers or to limit their powers. What we have tried to do is build on opportunities to influence Executive thinking and to develop policy. We in the Scottish Parliament are experts in failing to recognise that among the Parliaments of the world we are the only one to have a unit that actually helps members&#8212;not of the Government, but back benchers&#8212;through policy development, drafting and handling support.</p><p>What we have here today is not a political conspiracy but a failure to agree. Everyone has had a chance to talk about the issue and, even though I am a thick-skinned politician, I take slight umbrage at the pass-the-parcel game that we have been left with today.</p><p>Everyone also seems to have the answers. If there have been answers out there, we have been missing them since 2000, because we have been struggling with this problem since then. We have the problem because we have given members the expectation that they have a right to introduce a member's bill, irrespective of when they lodge it. That ambition clashes with the reality of management of the process and not the politics. It would be entirely wrong for any group of people, particularly the corporate body&#8212;which has been elected by and is accountable to Parliament&#8212;to make decisions about the merits of one bill as opposed to another. That would take us into a political area, which would be unacceptable.</p><p>To put matters in context, the criteria that we have described today will apply only when demand exceeds capacity. As Donald Gorrie said, that will happen, and our experience is that it does happen, which is why we are trying to manage the process. If we know or expect that demand will exceed capacity, we must manage the process. <place-holder colnum=\"19982\"/></p><p>Decisions about what bills are put to the side should not be made in a smoke-filled room or by a civil servant or an employee of the Scottish Parliament. As John Swinburne said, if a member's bill is not going to proceed, the member will want to know why. They will want to know what criteria were used and they will want the system to be open. That is what today's debate is trying to achieve.</p><p>Where is our point of reference? Iain Smith mentioned the Procedures Committee. Its report stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we were unable to agree on how a system of prioritisation could be made to work in a way that would achieve its main aim of improving the management of the Member's Bill process while still protecting the rights of backbench members to initiate legislation ideas and have them considered on their merits.\"</p><p>We are here today because the Procedures Committee could not agree.</p><p>The report goes on to say that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A Member's Bill should be an attempt to secure a worthwhile change\".</p><p>Iain Smith made a very good point about the democratic deficit. The Executive has the opportunity to exercise its democratic mandate as the elected Government.</p><p>The Procedures Committee report also stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A Member's Bill should be an attempt to secure a worthwhile change in the law (rather than a device to promote the member or his or her party's platform).\"</p><p>We are dealing with all those issues.</p><p>There has been a great deal of discussion today about complexity and about who decides what that is. Again, the point of reference is the Procedures Committee, which said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is probably no single criterion that can be adopted in advance that will resolve any competition among proposals for resources that might arise. In practice, there will be various factors that could or should be taken into account in making such decisions, without bringing in directly political considerations ... Other relevant factors may be the order in which members obtained a right to introduce a Bill; the relative complexity of the proposals and hence the resource implications of developing them into Bills\".</p><p>That is all in the Procedures Committee's report and it is our point of reference when we address the issue. Of course we considered whether it would be a good idea to put more people into NEBU, but as Rob Gibson pointed out, it is not just about putting more money into the unit. The Procedures Committee rightly acknowledged that some committee members feel that they have been forced to pursue member's bills against the interests of their committee's bills.

In fact, that speech represented an abrogation of political responsibility that would hand over the future of those people and communities to the courts to decide so that we could avoid making a difficult decision here today.</p><p>Up to now, the debate from the Opposition parties has been an exercise in creative avoidance&#8212;it has been about why we should not do this, how we will sit tight and how we will challenge the decision in this way and that. That is not brave politics. We have seen that rhetoric in the past; we saw it take the miners union to disaster&#8212;we have seen it take all sorts of workers to disaster. Certain people are always brave to say, \"We'll do this and we'll do that\", but we are talking about the reality of people's jobs, their lives, their pensions, their wages and conditions, how they get to work and how they live in their communities. Certain people are always brave to say, \"We'll back you up until your nose bleeds and then we'll complain that others failed you.\" We have a responsibility to face today; I and others made that clear last year. That is why we are having this debate&#8212;those Labour MSPs who have been much maligned ensured that today's debate would took place. Last year, we said that the proposed way in which the process was to be tendered was not acceptable to us and we blocked <place-holder colnum=\"19055\"/> it. We have worked hard&#8212;not on the rhetoric, but consistently, with ministers and with our colleagues, week after week&#8212;to ensure that what has been presented is a much better option than what was on the table last year.</p><p>I have a particular interest in the matter because my constituency boasts three ferry terminals: the CalMac terminals at Wemyss Bay and Gourock and the Western Ferries terminal at McInroy's point. Gourock is also the home of CalMac's headquarters, so it is not surprising that I have followed the highs and lows of the debate since 1999. I appreciate that I approach the problem from a different perspective to that of colleagues who represent island communities and our neighbours across the river in Argyll, but, as I said last December, we have a shared interest and have made common cause. Their hard work on behalf of their constituents throughout the process deserves our praise and is in marked contrast to the behaviour of the Johnnys-come-lately who tell us in slogans that the matter is all about privatisation whereas in fact it is about securing massive public subsidy and ensuring that that is not challenged. Whenever there is a political opportunity, however, Fergus Ewing will be there at the front.</p><p>I do not buy the conspiracy theory that the Executive, which I was forced to vote against in December, is motivated by a secret desire to privatise or sell out CalMac. On the contrary, if we are to avoid a debacle like the one at Fergusons it is essential that we get the tendering process right. Members should not wait until that process concludes and then complain when we lose out.</p><p>I have no doubt that progress has been made over the years and I have previously welcomed the Executive's commitment to the Gourock to Dunoon service. That commitment was not put in place automatically, and I welcome it. It is important that the service continues to exist. Loss of the route would jeopardise the planned transport interchanges and affect the redevelopment of the Gourock waterfront, which is an ambitious project that the Executive continues to back.</p><p>However, I was concerned that the proposed tendering process would have sold CalMac workers to the lowest bidder. That was not acceptable to me or to my constituents who work in the crews or at CalMac's Gourock headquarters, which provides highly valued jobs in a constituency that has consistently higher levels of unemployment. I could not back what the Executive proposed. The fact is that specifications to safeguard the workforce, the routes and the location of the company's offices can and should be written into any tender. I take some comfort from the fact that the minister now acknowledges <place-holder colnum=\"19056\"/> that and I welcome the fact that the specification that must be met by bidders addresses those issues.</p><p>It is vital that staff pay and conditions, including pensions, are protected. There is agreement about the situation at NorthLink Ferries. I have made consistent representations to ministers over a long period of time on behalf of my constituents who serve on its vessels. In many cases, they were forced to go to the courts to ensure their rights. Surely that cannot be proper.</p><p>On the location of the headquarters, again it is crucial that the tender documents contain the appropriate safeguards. As I have argued consistently, those documents must stipulate that the HQ is close to the services that are operated and they must contain a clear disincentive to relocate. Indeed, it would be sensible for the vesco's headquarters to be sited alongside the existing headquarters at Gourock. I make no apology for the fact that the future of my constituents who are employed by CalMac and the future of the Gourock development are the extent of my interest in the matter.</p><p>The fact is that we are where we are. The primacy of European Union law over United Kingdom law is long established. We might not like it, but we need to make the best of it. We need to meet our international obligations and our moral obligations to those who elected us. For me, whether the solution that has been proposed today meets both requirements depends on whether it safeguards key infrastructure projects and the future of the workforce.

Recently, Nova Scotia and Ontario increased the age limit to 19. <place-holder colnum=\"18685\"/></p><p>Of course, there is no need to look across the world for good examples when there is a good example under our noses. Guernsey, with its devolved Government, has introduced a package of measures to reduce smoking. It has increased to 18 the age at which people may buy tobacco and the island is now credited as a world leader in reducing smoking among young people. The number of young people who report that they smoke has reduced by half and only 3 per cent of 11-year-olds think that they will smoke when they are older. Nearly twice as many young people smoke in the UK as in Guernsey.</p><p>If amendment 1 leads to an increase in the legal age for tobacco sales from 16 to 18, we will not be a world leader. We will not even be the first part of the British isles to introduce such legislation. We will simply be modernising our laws to give children the protection that is the norm throughout the modern world.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13344402", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 7A &#8212; Sale of tobacco to under-age persons: variation of limit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the amendments that have been lodged by the Executive and Stewart Maxwell, because they give us an opportunity to review the age restriction on the sale of tobacco that dates back to the previous century, when smoking was viewed as harmless and glamorous.

I am part of the majority on the Health Committee which believes that the bill will have a positive impact and will help to save lives.</p><p>Members who sit on subject committees might agree that some evidence-taking sessions are less than illuminating, consisting largely of people whom we would expect to be giving evidence giving the evidence that we would expect them to give. The Health Committee's stage 1 evidence on this bill&#8212;on part 1 at least&#8212;was a prime example. In one corner, we had the fundamentalists; in the other, the libertarians. Round after round, they traded statistics and counter-statistics and bashed each other with studies and counter-studies. In the end, they boxed themselves to a standstill.</p><p>Did anything emerge from that? It is pretty clear, and accepted by all, that active smoking kills. We knew that already. Passive smoking can kill&#8212;especially when people are exposed to high levels of second-hand smoke. As the minister pointed out, people who live with smokers are at a greater risk of smoking-related disease. However, that is not the same as saying that environmental tobacco smoke in public places is, on its own, going to kill people. It would be interesting to see the results of a study that focused purely on people who were exposed to tobacco smoke only, for example, in a pub on a Friday night. We did not see such a study.<place-holder colnum=\"16501\"/></p><p>We heard a lot about the Irish experience. Some elements in the chamber are desperate for us to copy Ireland at every turn. I sometimes think that, to have an influence in Scottish politics, a person would have to be elected to the D&#225;il. However, in this case, we could learn from the Irish approach. As the committee heard, the Irish did not turn down the choice versus health cul-de-sac. They bypassed the argument between the right to smoke and the right to clean air. That is an argument in which we have become bogged down, turning the debate into one between smokers and anti-smokers.</p><p>Instead, the Irish concentrated on the working conditions of employees in the hospitality industry. By doing so, they united smokers and non-smokers in support of the ban. We all know that employees do not have the choice that customers have over whether to enter particular premises. Employees also spend far longer in such environments or atmospheres than their customers do; sometimes employees will spend long periods in those atmospheres seven days a week.</p><p>I have campaigned across the whole range of industries for the right of workers to have a safe working environment. If the health of workers in the hospitality industry is damaged by working in a smoky environment, I cannot stand here and argue that they should be denied the same protection that is afforded to every other worker.</p><p>However&#8212;I borrow an argument from the Green Party when it talks about genetically modified crops&#8212;just because we can do something does not automatically mean that we should do it. We must ensure that smokers do not feel stigmatised by this process. We cannot just impose our will from on high; we need to win smokers round to our arguments and we need to take them with us. If we are to tackle the large number of active smokers, we need to offer them the opportunity to become part of the debate. As others have said, we cannot marginalise them.</p><p>We cannot sweep the problems of addiction under the carpet. We all know that most smokers would like to stop. All smokers wish that they had not started and I think that they would back moves to help them to stop. They would also want to prevent their children and grandchildren from starting in the first place, and to protect them from being harmed by smoke at their workplace.</p><p>We are serious about tackling the damage that is done by tobacco and I think that smokers will join us in welcoming new legislation. Smokers and non-smokers will also support us in using the powers that we already have. What about illegal sales of tobacco to children? We know that it happens&#8212;from ice-cream vans to corner shops. <place-holder colnum=\"16502\"/></p><p>Smokers and non-smokers disapprove of that, so let us have some action.</p><p>Should we allow anyone&#8212;including parents and teachers&#8212;to stand smoking in school premises or adjacent to them as they wait to pick up children? We can see that happening as we go by our nurseries and schools. We have powers and we should use them. Smokers and non-smokers would agree that it is wrong to set that bad example.</p><p>We need to reduce the harm that tobacco does in our communities&#8212;particularly in communities such as my own, where smoking is clearly killing people who are too young to die. The need to reduce harm is not up for discussion. In new legislation, we must not worry about the comfort or the agendas of unelected lobbyists, however well-meaning they might be. Instead, we must pursue the principle of reducing smoking and the damage that it does in our communities.</p>", "hdate": "2005-04-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13338824", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill will bring direct improvements to the health of people in Scotland.

Where there is a greater number of dentists and where there are increased opportunities for access, the result is poorer rates of dental health.</p><p>The report helpfully points out several aspects of that phenomenon. Availability and dentist to population ratios are important, but the proportion of time that dentists spend with patients, disabled and wheelchair access to local dentists and the distance to the surgery are also important factors.

The issue is too serious to be used as a political football. I find it slightly distasteful that the SNP has chosen the subject as an excuse for its latest synthetic constitutional crisis. I will not say too much about that, because the subject is not fit for party-political knockabout. I merely invite the SNP to reflect on whether citing recent tragedies and implying that one constitutional arrangement rather than another could prevent them might be seen as crass.</p><p>The nationalists have not made a case for the claim in the motion that we have a</p><p class=\"indent\">\"distinct ... gun problem in Scotland\",</p><p>or even that we have a distinct problem in the UK. Given the SNP's fondness for league tables and referring to other countries, I am surprised that it did not come across the fact in the Home Office consultation that firearm homicide rates are worse in Lithuania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and Sweden&#8212;the list goes on. Firearms regulation is not like other devolved issues such as health, in relation to which our geography and public health profile mean that we need specific Scottish solutions to particular Scottish problems. The issue is not like education or justice, in which Scotland has distinct systems&#8212;guns are just as deadly in Glasgow as they are in Gateshead.</p><p>In any event, the important question is not who makes the laws, but their substantive content. Much has been said about tightening the <place-holder colnum=\"15691\"/> regulations on air-guns. The Executive is right to work with the Home Office to make them harder to acquire. I also welcome the First Minister's determination to close any loopholes and get air-guns out of circulation. In the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, Westminster rightly increased the minimum age for the possession of an air weapon from 14 to 17 and introduced a new offence of having an unloaded air weapon in a public place without a reasonable excuse.</p><p>Of course, we might conclude that we need to go further, but I am sure that any reforms will be something on which the Home Office and the Scottish Executive will work closely in the interests of nothing other than public safety.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Firearms Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As members have said, the motion is not entirely without merit.

As Pauline McNeill and others have pointed out, we have an abundance of raw musical talent in Scotland. The question, of course, is how, in practical terms, we can harness and develop that talent. Members with an interest in the subject could do much worse than examine the great work that is being <place-holder colnum=\"15435\"/> done at Greenock's James Watt College of Further and Higher Education in my constituency. I hope that the minister will take the opportunity to visit and witness for herself at first hand the good work that is taking place there. Perhaps even the members of the cross-party group on contemporary music will visit some time in the future.</p><p>In 1999, the college shared with me its vision of a state-of-the-art community music centre for Inverclyde. It wanted a centre of excellence based in the community that was attractive to and supportive of young people. It would offer music and audio technology teaching alongside business start-up support and other services that young musicians need, such as rehearsal areas, recording studios, a performance venue and a personal computer suite.</p><p>True to its word, the college has made its vision a reality. The brand-new facility&#8212;the opening of which I attended last year&#8212;will make it much easier for young musicians to take the all-important first step into the professional music industry. As many members have mentioned, the financial outlay that is required by a new band to put on its first performance makes the experience too much of a gamble. The ready-made performance venue and the gaining of some basic business skills will undoubtedly make that leap a great deal easier, releasing more of our young talent.</p><p>Back in 1999, when the college's plans were first floated, I remember fearing and discussing with the college that the usual suspects would moan about layabouts with long hair and say, \"It wasn't called a job in my day.\" Thankfully, the response to the investment has been far more positive. It is accepted that it is not a waste of money and is not following a fad, but rather makes perfect social and economic sense.</p><p>Music is an important part of young people's lives and can act as a stabilising factor for young people who have turbulent personal or home lives. It also helps young people to develop essential life skills. How can someone reach performance standard without self-confidence? How can they stage a live event without communication or financial skills?</p><p>I am delighted that Pauline McNeill gave us the opportunity to have this debate and I am delighted that James Watt College took such a bold step and that young people will have access to the college's wonderful resource. As a near neighbour of the college, I am also delighted that the studios are well sound-proofed and that I can live in peace.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336177", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Franz Ferdinand Rocks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As my presence here proves, we do not need to be down with the kids or an authority on the hit parade to realise that the music industry&#8212;[ Interruption. ] Members are laughing.

New employers have moved into the area and sections of our waterfront&#8212;a real asset in the Clyde area&#8212;have been regenerated.</p><p>However, some of the legacy of those years remains. Our economic base is still too narrow, we are still too reliant on a small number of large employers in electronics and manufacturing industry and we have to deal with the problem that occurs every winter when companies lay off workers during the annual market downturn. We also face a challenge of global competition but, although we will never compete with sweatshop economies on cost&#8212;and nor should we&#8212;today's worldwide marketplace offers opportunities such as those that the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning discussed with the Chinese company Lenovo, which is due to come into my constituency in the spring.</p><p>The only way in which we will be able to deliver sustained economic regeneration is by making Inverclyde the home of high-skill, high-value and secure jobs.

That said, I am slightly unnerved by all the agreement in the chamber, as it does not exactly suit my debating style.</p><p>To the outside observer&#8212;and, at times, to humble back benchers&#8212;politics can be a slow business. The wheels of government seem to take an age to grind. However, in the Scottish Parliament at least, if people make their case repeatedly and stick to it, those wheels certainly will grind.</p><p>The way in which the criminal justice system treats victims and witnesses&#8212;if that is the way to describe what happens&#8212;is a prime example. It is clear from other members' speeches that I am not the only MSP to represent constituents who, after falling victim to an offence, felt excluded and humiliated by the system. Victims or their families were effectively told that matters such as the Parole Board system were nothing to do with them <place-holder colnum=\"13548\"/> and, after conviction, their involvement came to an end. That was the case for decades. Indeed, I recall two of my constituents telling me of almost identical experiences, despite the fact that the incidents in question occurred almost 20 years apart.</p><p>If the Scottish Parliament is good at one thing, it is the reform of specific aspects of the legal system. Indeed, we have started to take a number of big steps in that respect, such as the passing of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003. Provisions such as victim statements, new rights to information about an assailant's proposed release and the right to make representations to the Parole Board about any release have all put a few pounds on the victims' side of the justice scales.</p><p>Now that the wheels have been set in motion, they show no signs of slowing down, as the publication of the criminal justice plan at the beginning of last month shows. It is hard to disagree with the plan's aim of restoring public confidence in the criminal justice system, but the key to any such approach must be a reduction in reoffending rates. After all, what is the point of working harder to catch and convict criminals if, at the end of their sentence, they are simply allowed back on to the streets to commit more crime?</p><p>The international comparisons are not favourable. In America, 47 per cent of prisoners reoffend within two years of their release. In Norway, the figure is 43 per cent and in Germany it is 36 per cent. In Scotland, to our shame, 67 per cent of prisoners&#8212;six out of ten&#8212;reoffend within two years of their release, in a cycle that not only wastes valuable time and money but creates a whole new set of victims each time round. It is right that a top priority for the plan is to break that cycle and put a spanner in the revolving doors of our prisons and courts.</p><p>I restate my view that the Parole Board must be made more accountable. It is only fair that we should have the right to challenge Parole Board decisions and be given reasons for prisoners' release on licence. I look forward to the Executive's continuing work in the area.</p><p>We are all members of the public and as such we are not disinterested bystanders.

For those who have been sad enough to listen, I have been saying for long enough that access to health services is as important as the services themselves. A service that people cannot access is no service at all. So, it is good news for patients that all available space at the Golden Jubilee national hospital is to be brought into clinical use. It is good news for patients that the Executive will seriously consider Professor David Kerr's report on the national framework on service change to see what further opportunities it brings.</p><p>It is good news for patients that we will provide mobile diagnostic units in our communities.

Early diagnosis, which those mobile units will deliver, could add years and quality to people's lives.</p><p>Let me nail some of the nonsense about this being all about saving money. As the minister reminded us, by 2007-08, the health budget will have risen to &#163;10 billion&#8212;a 110 per cent rise since 1999.

The SNP says, \"We don't care. Let them wait.\" The minister says that there will be penalty clauses in the contracts for services to prevent the poaching of NHS staff. The SNP is not interested; it says, \"Let them wait.\" The minister is designing reforms to guarantee that they will add to NHS capacity. The SNP does not care; it says, \"Let them wait.\" The SNP is used to waiting, of course. It has been waiting for independence for a long time now, but we will not wait with it. It will never achieve independence because it is out of touch. <place-holder colnum=\"12915\"/></p><p>The SNP does not care about patients having to wait; it is more worried about holding on to an old and outdated ideology.

For that reason, I welcome <place-holder colnum=\"12224\"/> the opportunity that Irene Oldfather has given us to have the debate.</p><p>What are the barriers to achieving the goal? An article in the <em>BMJ </em>in June reported on research by Chapple, Ziebland and McPherson that gives voice to lung cancer victims. The research study finds that lung cancer patients feel stigmatised&#8212;especially those who have stopped smoking, who believe that they were affected by industrial pollutants in their working lives or who have never smoked. Whether or not they smoked, they felt particularly stigmatised because the disease is strongly associated with smoking.</p><p>It was found that many patients felt unjustly blamed for their illness. Some believed that the medical profession failed to take proper notice of their smoker's cough and put off diagnosis. A patient suggested that the Government allocates less money to screening for and research into lung cancer because of the link with smoking. Many spoke of feelings of guilt and shame. That led some patients to conceal their illness, which sometimes had adverse financial consequences or made it hard for them to gain support from other people.</p><p>If we are serious about raising awareness of lung cancer with the campaign, we need to understand why people do not report early and what part politicians and figures in the public health debate have played in the reluctance to report.</p><p>The scary statistics that are trotted out in hard-hitting advertisements and debates such as today's may have unintended consequences. The study to which I referred found that television advertisements that aim&#8212;rightly&#8212;to put young people off tobacco, but which also portray a dreadful death, may exacerbate fear and anxiety. One patient said that the ads upset her greatly because they made her fear a dreadful death by drowning. They affected her deeply and increased her fear and anxiety.</p><p>All that makes patients worried that diagnosis, access to care and research into lung cancer might be adversely affected by the stigma that is attached to the disease. We must raise awareness about lung cancer, but about all aspects. Tackling lung cancer involves more than just reaffirming the evils of tobacco.

I thank all those members who have signed the motion and who have made time to attend the first ever members' business debate in the new chamber.</p><p>When one looks seriously at the issue of suicide, one's own worries suddenly seem a lot less important. When I spoke in the last members' business debate before we handed our temporary lodgings back to our theological landlords, I reflected that it was appropriate to ask, \"Why are we here?\" Today, in the first members' business debate in our new building, members might well ask the same question.</p><p>Well, I will tell members why we are here. We are here because the biggest killer of young men in Scotland is neither a blade nor a car but their own hand. According to the Samaritans, although suicide rates in England and Wales fell over the 10 years up to 2002, they rose in Scotland. The latest figures show that people in Scotland are twice as likely to kill themselves as people in the rest of the UK are. Although I welcome the fact that the numbers are now falling, suicide is still the main cause of death for men aged 15 to 44. Indeed, according to the Registrar General for Scotland, almost three quarters of those who committed suicide last year were male.</p><p>The reasons are many and varied; they are medical, cultural and social. They include mental health problems that are brought about or are made worse by drug abuse; the lack of a role for men in our society and the tendency to blame young working-class men for just about everything; unemployment or financial worries; a stressful living environment; the inability to come to terms with homosexuality or the fear of doing so; and a reluctance to seek help from a health service that is neither designed to meet, nor particularly sympathetic to, men's needs.<place-holder colnum=\"9983\"/></p><p>So what do we do about the situation? We cannot eliminate stress, money worries or setbacks from modern life. No matter how tough we are, the war on drugs will not be won overnight. Moreover, although we must carry on working to tackle stigma over mental health and to end prejudice about homosexuality, we cannot continue with the waste of young lives until that work is done.</p><p>If we are going to end Scotland's suicide shame and take long-term action to address the root causes that can be addressed, we also need to better equip young men to deal with the difficulties that they will face. Given our reluctance to seek help, we need more people in our communities who are trained to spot the early signs and to step in to prevent suicide.</p><p>That is why I believe that the Executive is to be commended for initiatives such as the choose life strategy, which is aimed at reducing suicides by 20 per cent over the next 10 years, and the introduction of applied suicide intervention skills training. I also welcome the fact that, through the choose life initiative, every local authority will by the end of the year have trained staff accredited with such intervention skills. I do not intend to detain members at length with the details of those schemes, because I am sure that the minister will ably highlight the Executive's work in his response.</p><p>However, I would like to urge the Executive to push on with its efforts to meet and exceed its targets. In particular, as far as the Health Department is concerned, we should examine how we can change the NHS to ensure that it is more responsive to men's needs. Does the way in which we treat depression need to be revisited? Do we provide adequate health education in this area? We will need to answer those questions and others if we are to end the scandal of young men feeling that they have so little to live for and so little hope that their only way out is to take their own lives.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13322312", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Suicide Prevention Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Are we up and running?

Although the motion is about Argyll and Clyde as a whole, I will not surprise anybody here by focusing my remarks on Inverclyde royal hospital. In doing so, I declare an interest. Inverclyde royal hospital is my hospital. It is not just in my constituency; it is in my <place-holder colnum=\"9848\"/> community. It is where my mother went when she recently broke her hip and where my wife went when she broke her shoulder. Indeed, as a result of the maternity contingency plans, it is my grandchild who is likely to be born in Paisley and not in the Rankin unit this autumn. When the stress of fighting the continued plans from the health board to centralise the services finally gives me a heart attack, Inverclyde royal is where I want to go.</p><p>In the last ever parliamentary debate in this chamber before we hand it back to our theological friends, I suppose that it is appropriate to ask, \"Why are we here?\" How did we arrive at a situation where, on one hand, the Government&#8212;or, to be more precise, the taxpayer&#8212;is putting more cash than ever into the national health service and, on the other, our services seem to be disappearing?</p><p>The root of the problem, as I have long argued, is NHS work-force planning. I have spoken countless times in the chamber about the impact that that is having on services. I take some comfort from the fact that the British Medical Association and Sir John Temple now publicly acknowledge the importance of the issue. The Health Committee is set to question the health industry's key players as part of its major work-force planning inquiry.</p><p>The issue is not just about money&#8212;I wish that it was, but if it was that simple, we would have solved it. If politicians are good at anything, it is giving more money to the national health service.</p><p>If the problem of centralisation is the same throughout Scotland, the proposed solutions are not. Other areas are responding better by, for example, sharing services between hospitals. However, Argyll and Clyde NHS Board's plans are almost all one-way traffic. It seeks to cram most of those in need of emergency or in-patient services into a hospital that is already struggling to cope with its current numbers&#8212;Paisley Royal Alexandra hospital is full to bursting. We all agree that the strategy has weaknesses, but if we are to expose them, we need to muster support, knowledge and expertise.</p><p>Our local newspaper, the <em>Greenock Telegraph</em>, has to be congratulated on leaving the health board in no doubt about the strength of local feeling. Such support is essential, but on its own it is not enough. We must also back up our passion with precision. In other words, we must engage the health bosses on their own terms and challenge their arguments and the assumptions on which they rely with cold, hard facts. In order to frame our arguments, I have been speaking to academics, clinicians, trade unions and the many others who deliver our health services locally.<place-holder colnum=\"9849\"/></p><p>Tomorrow, I will make the case for Inverclyde royal to Dr Andrew Walker, the top academic who is charged with independently evaluating the plan. Although I would not seek to pre-empt his expert analysis, I am convinced, after examining the strategy in some detail, that it is seriously flawed and that a better way forward can be found.</p><p>A number of clinicians are ready to stand up and be counted. Leading Inverclyde general practitioner and chair of the local health care co-operative, Dr Mustafa Kapasi, and senior consultant surgeon and clinical director of surgery at the Inverclyde royal hospital, Mr Ian Morrice, have both assured me that they are prepared to challenge the plans and play their part in drawing up credible alternatives. I now hope that others will come on board, because there is a big job to do.</p><p>The health board's proposals are the product of many officials working over many months&#8212;those are two luxuries that we will have to do without when we draft our alternatives. I therefore look forward to the Minister for Health and Community Care outlining how our efforts will be supported in terms of time, resources and expertise. I would also welcome an undertaking that the minister will ensure that equal weight is given to any alternative plan and to the health board plan.</p><p>Finally, we need a guarantee that the consultation process will be worthy of the name. I agree that the process is a complex one, but my bottom line is that closure is not an option.

Indeed, we should celebrate the fact that we have made a difference to the lives of people who suffer from asbestos-related cancers.</p><p>Although it was necessary and right for us to tackle the injustice of the legal system in respect of treatment of asbestos victims, and to focus on issues such as compensation and justice, such an approach might well have sidelined the human and health aspects of the problem.

It is a cancer like any other cancer, which is why, as Des McNulty rightly points out in his motion, it is essential that people be diagnosed early. After all, early diagnosis prolongs lives&#8212;compensation does not.</p><p>Obviously, we support Des McNulty's call for the Scottish Executive Health Department to develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with the matter. However, we should also remember that the legal system traumatised the people who were involved. Not only were they presented with horrible medical evidence about how their bodies were breaking up, but they and their families had to sit through discussions about that evidence in courtrooms and with lawyers. We had to deal with such a dehumanising system.</p><p>Tonight's motion gives us a real opportunity to get on to the preventive issues and the more <place-holder colnum=\"8994\"/> human issues, and to offer the support that families need.

Although I would not presume to speak for Johann Lamont, I think that I am safe in saying that we are grateful to all the members who have made time to attend the debate.</p><p>I will focus my speech on the problems that disabled drivers face in private car parks and on the work that the Baywatch campaign has done. <place-holder colnum=\"8101\"/></p><p>Let me give an example. A young woman who is the primary carer for her mother came to me at a surgery in Inverkip in my constituency. She told me that the highlight of her mother's week was her outing to the shops in Greenock&#8212;as soon as she was back in the house after one trip, she was looking forward to the next. That is a simple pleasure, I am sure members will agree, but it is made almost impossible to enjoy through selfishness and indifference. Fresh from the young woman's Herculean efforts to get her mother up and dressed, they get to the shops only to find the disabled parking spaces filled with the cars of perfectly able-bodied people. That is unacceptable, unless sheer bone idleness is counted as a disability.</p><p>When disabled drivers and their carers make representations, they get a shrug from the car park attendant or warm words, but no action from the store management. That is not a clever move. Turning a blind eye could leave stores facing legal action under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995&#8212;indeed, they are vulnerable to legal action now, not just in October when the additional rules come into effect.</p><p>As every member here tonight knows perfectly well, the case to which I have referred is not an isolated one. A survey conducted by the campaign group Baywatch shows that the rate of abuse rose from 18.5 per cent in January 2003 to nearly 21 per cent in January 2004. In other words, more than one in five disabled parking bays are being used by non-disabled drivers. Although we might not like to admit it, we in Scotland are the laziest and most selfish of the lot. We abuse the system at a rate of 27 per cent, whereas in Wales only 23 per cent of bays are dishonestly occupied and only 19 per cent of bays are abused by the far more considerate English.</p><p>A survey of more than 800 car parks that belong to the big four supermarkets throughout the United Kingdom showed that in more than a third&#8212;37 per cent&#8212;of stores disabled people were unable to park in a designated space because of abuse by non-badge holders. All supermarkets have seen an increase in abuse levels. People who complain to stores say that the response they receive has worsened, with only 30 per cent saying that stores responded well to complaints, compared with 32 per cent in 2003.</p><p>What can be done? First, the anger and frustration of disabled drivers and their carers must be recognised, as must the severe impact that the abuse of disabled parking bays has on their quality of life. Secondly, I ask for the minister's help in getting all the interested parties round the table to discuss the powers that are currently on the statute book, how they can be used and by whom. Thirdly, will the minister <place-holder colnum=\"8102\"/> assure me that, if those steps fail, we will examine the possibility of extending the powers of local authorities to allow parking attendants or environmental wardens to enforce parking policies in private car parks? It is sad that we might need to stop appealing to people's better nature and to start appealing to their pockets, but if that is what it takes to make it game over for the space invaders, that is what will have to happen.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13317702", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Disabled Parking Spaces"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Johann Lamont for working with me to secure the debate.

Who was against reducing junior doctors' hours? I see no hands going up. Which members of the Health Committee were against improving general practitioner and consultant contracts? None of us. However, we failed to secure the flexibility within those contracts that would allow us maximum access to services. What depresses me and frustrates me as a politician is that we have not tackled that issue over the past few months and years.</p><p>The minister needs to take into consideration the need for active engagement of consultants. The Rankin maternity unit was closed down not by Malcolm Chisholm but by the consultants who informed the health board that they could no <place-holder colnum=\"6677\"/> longer sustain a safe service. The same happened to the Vale of Leven hospital. We all get emotional about that, but it is very dangerous to go down the road of allowing politicians to instruct clinicians about what is and is not safe.</p><p>Eleanor Scott set a commendable example&#8212;although it might be quiet in at least one household tonight&#8212;by putting the case from the clinical perspective. However, too few clinicians have been prepared to do that. During Argyll and Clyde NHS Board's consultation on maternity services, which went on for years, not one consultant was prepared to turn up at any of the meetings. They were not prepared to face the public and to explain that as well as receive an increase in wages they would work fewer weekends and that services would have to be centralised as a result.</p><p>We need to tackle that issue and I hope that the cross-party Health Committee will provide us with an opportunity to rally to that challenge. If we do, it will be the first time Parliament has done that. Carolyn Leckie was right that Parliament has had four years to tackle the planning issues in the national health service that we all knew were coming, but we neglected to look at them. The Health and Community Care Committee did not consider those issues at all, but the Health Committee is now beginning to consider them. The horse might have bolted&#8212;I concede that we may be chasing it&#8212;but I hope that we will be given the opportunity to get clinical opinion to join the debate that needs to take place. I also hope that we can bring out these people who call themselves the \"royal colleges\".

I support the motion in Malcolm Chisholm's name, as it recognises the challenge that faces the Executive and the national health service and the need for more flexible ways of working. The minister is right that staffing issues&#8212;how professionals are recruited, trained, retrained and deliver their services&#8212;are at the heart of the major issues in today's NHS. Indeed, they are the key to cracking perhaps the biggest challenge&#8212;the relentless march towards centralisation.</p><p>As we know, throughout the country staffing problems are causing or being used as an excuse for the centralisation of acute services, sparking outrage in local communities. With the agreement on junior doctors' hours, which is now legally enforceable, the implementation later this year of the European working time directive, the impending fallout from the new GP contract and the new, expensive consultant contract, things may get worse before they can get better.</p><p>Following the summer of centralisation, the Health Committee agreed to hold a major inquiry into NHS staffing and training, the details of which are being drawn up. I am glad that the Executive now realises that the issue is sufficiently important to warrant a debate in the chamber. However, I am concerned that the talk of building and supporting the NHS work force is code for trying to deliver patient-centred services by giving professional staff whatever they want&#8212;in other words, acceding to professionals' demands at the expense of the community's expectations.</p><p>No right-thinking person would want to be treated by a tired, badly trained doctor, but that is not the same as saying that the interests of professionals and the interests of patients are always one and the same. Some might go so far as to say that on occasion they are mutually exclusive. For example, our communities want accessible health services in which they feel they have a stake. Our consultants want to work in massive teaching hospitals that reflect their specialist interests and they want to reduce their weekend working. Our communities think that they elect us to run the health service. The royal colleges, with their grip on work force planning, know that they run it. Of course, the issue of who runs the NHS is not a new one. Bevan famously said that he had to stuff the consultants' mouths with gold to get them into the NHS in the first place.</p><p>That takes us neatly to the issue of the new <place-holder colnum=\"6132\"/> consultant contract. We increased top consultants' pay from &#163;70,000 to &#163;80,000 a year in return for greater flexibility. Under the terms of the GP contract, which was debated in the chamber last night, we will again hand over money up front without guarantees of reform. Questions remain. How much has it cost and will it cost? What benefits are guaranteed for patients and when will they be delivered? I hope that we have not paid for a pig in a poke.</p><p>We must ensure that we get value for the public purse in courage, innovation and change and that we challenge the vested interests that would prevent change. Until we tackle the reform issue, debates such as this about raw numbers will be fairly academic. It does not matter how much more money we stuff in or how many more people we employ&#8212;if we employ them in the same way, there will not be much change. If professionals do not work flexibly and we do not consider upskilling nurses or improving training, we will not reap any benefits. The vast majority of NHS staff want to deliver a first-class service for patients, to maximise their skills and to develop their careers. However, vested interests are putting barriers in their way. If we want to maximise the potential of NHS staff and to deliver the consequential improvements in patient care, those barriers must be brought down wherever they are found.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13312149", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service (Work Force)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate; I thought at lunch time that I had lost my chance.

I am not quite sure what that says about those of us who have been in the chamber today, or whether it sheds any light on what our colleagues who are absent from the chamber are up to.</p><p>As we have heard today, talking about sex is central to any sexual health strategy. We need to get around our natural&#8212;some would say ingrained&#8212;embarrassment if we are to communicate the messages effectively. One consequence of HIV and AIDS was that we were forced to discuss issues such as contraception. In the olden days it was different: using protection meant using a bus shelter and safe sex meant ensuring that our parents did not find out. When we were forced to face up to the reality of AIDS, when we started to see condom adverts on television and Government information campaigns about practising safer sex, a significant step forward was taken. We should acknowledge the role of the Conservative Government of the day in breaking down some of the taboos around sexual activity&#8212;although the Conservatives would not like to see themselves cast in that role today.</p><p>The debate has made it clear that work remains to be done. We have read that one in four young people has sexual intercourse before they are 16 and many of them regret it. Given that more than 50 per cent of parents do not talk to their children about sex and sexual health, that sexually transmitted infections are on the increase and that the teenage pregnancy rate in Scotland is among the highest in western Europe, the case for communicating a clear message on sexual health is strong.</p><p>We can argue about exactly what that message <place-holder colnum=\"4784\"/> might be. For example, I might want more emphasis to be placed on the importance of relationships and on helping young people to raise their self-esteem and self-confidence, but someone else might want more emphasis on the mechanics, an issue that David Davidson spoke about. We can discuss such issues as the consultation continues, and continue it must. We need to get this right.</p><p>In the remainder of my time, I would like to make the case for communication&#8212;especially with younger people. I acknowledge at the outset that not everyone agrees that that is the best way forward. There is resistance, even to the issue of communication, never mind to the difficult issues that arise during that communication. Some people, for the commendable motive of wishing to protect their children's innocence, feel that the more we educate children about sex, the more likely they are to become involved in under-age sex. I am not sure about that argument. Pupils in Inverclyde get about six hours of sex education a year and about five hours of maths a week. If that argument is correct, we should have more mathematicians than young mothers. I suspect that other factors may be at work. I do not accept that there is a proven link between sex education and increased under-age sexual activity. Rather, I believe that arming young people with the information that they need to make good choices, and giving them the confidence to exercise those choices, will give them more protection than they would otherwise have.</p><p>That said, it is wrong to think that all communication should be left up to schools. Parents must and should play a role. There must be a partnership between the classroom and the living room. We cannot leave that too late. We have more chance of having meaningful dialogue with Beagle 2 than with a 16-year-old about the facts of life.</p><p>I will conclude with this point: if we do not communicate, someone else will. If we do not give our kids the facts, they will seek them out elsewhere. I hope that the strategy will, with the good will and support of the Executive, ensure that, if nothing else, our young people no longer need to resort to that.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308752", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sexual Health and Relationship Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "They say that when it comes to sex there are those who do it and those who talk about it.

I remember running up muddy hills and swimming past the icebergs in the Battery park pond, while the technical teacher had a fag and threatened us if we did not get in there&#8212;if we survived hypothermia, we were doing very well.</p><p>I remember being forced to play something called rugby&#8212;a game that was as alien to us west coast boys as attending the chamber is to the SSP. Not that that mattered too much, because we got plenty of exercise away from school. We chased buses, sugar lorries, ice-cream vans and milk motors. We all used to play street games&#8212;do members remember them? We played enduring favourites, such as football and rounders; those that have not stood the test of time, such as ring-bang-skoosh; and those that would get us in trouble with the politically correct police, such as cowboys and Indians&#8212;or western imperialists and oppressed indigenous persons, as we would now call it.</p><p>Even watching television kept us fit. We lived in the bottom flat, with our TV aerial in the tenement loft. Every time we lost the picture, I was dispatched up four floors to hang from the skylight, performing gymnastics, in an attempt to get \"Joe 90\" in focus. The received wisdom is that we had a far better diet back then. Coke was what we put on the fire, and going for a McDonald's meant buying eggs from the local farmer.</p><p>But times have changed, and we have to recognise that. Children these days are more likely to be managing Brazil on the Xbox than kicking a ball outside in the street. They are more used to being driven to school in the family car than running for a bus. It is more common for a child today to learn about brain trauma from the kids' science channel than to go into a boxing ring.</p><p>The thing that I do not get, though, is why if my contemporaries were all so rosy cheeked and full of natural goodness back in the wholesome 1950s, my generation is dropping down dead with heart attacks left, right and centre? We have to remember that point today.

As soon as we did not have to go to sadistic physical education classes at school, when chasing girls was more interesting than chasing vans, and when we lost the jobs that kept us physically active, no other exercise was built into our daily lives. That is known in the medical profession as the Derek Johnstone syndrome.</p><p>The consequences are all round us. That is why the minister&#8212;with whom I regularly keep active on the golf courses of Lanarkshire&#8212;is right to be increasing access to sport and to fitness facilities for those of us who might be a bit set in our ways.

Ofgem wants to educate us about its priorities and objectives for the future, but what is new about that, given that this is what we do all the time? We might be at a school on a Monday, at a committee taking evidence from experts on a Tuesday and on a Wednesday we might be at a parliamentary debate such as today's debate on changes in general practitioners' contracts.</p><p>The events that we attend are such that I learned a bit more about the children's panel system during one lunch time when I&#8212;I think back in June&#8212;along with other members, met the chair of my local children's panel. For me, that did wonders in dispelling the popular misconception, which I think I shared with others, that the hearings system was only about dealing with young offenders. We have concentrated on that a bit tonight, but I learned then that that is only part of the job. The panels also exist to look out for kids who need care or protection. It was explained to me that a child can be referred to a panel for many reasons, from being the victim of an offence to misusing alcohol or drugs. It is up to the hearing to <place-holder colnum=\"2702\"/> decide what is in the best interests of the child.</p><p>As has been made clear in the debate, the unstinting work of the panels, which consist of unpaid trained volunteers, is what has made the hearings work and endure over the past three decades. People give up their time to take part and in an age when people say that volunteering and community spirit is dead, the panel members contradict that wonderfully.</p><p>I was delighted to learn that Inverclyde children's panel boasts 58 members. Good as that is, when one considers that the panel deals with 1,000 referrals a year and holds five hearings a week, it is understandable that the panel wants to boost numbers further. As the three panel members who make up a children's hearing may not all be female, the panel is particularly keen to recruit more men.</p><p>Making the right choices for children is a huge responsibility, but we must send out the message that panel members do not need to be child care experts or top lawyers. As I discovered when I dropped into a training session one Sunday morning, children's panel members come from all walks of life. Although people were committed for a whole day, the place was packed.</p><p>We can all argue in support of children's panels, but we need to convince people, such as those in my area who may not be in employment but who have skills that they have built up over many years through working with apprentices, and who are blessed with common sense, that they can care about their community and kids.

Each party sits on its own side, pretending that the other does not exist and deluding itself that it can function as a self-contained unit.

To whom are they accountable?</p><p>Let me return to the example of my local maternity unit.

The impact of the European working time directive, the agreement on junior doctors hours and the move towards sub-specialisation are making it difficult, if not impossible, to deliver services in hospitals in my constituency and throughout Scotland. That limits local access and forces people to travel further for treatment. Although I am in no way against improving working conditions for staff in the hospitals, I ask myself what other business or public service would cease to provide a service based on rules, guidance or agreements with the work force.

Tom McCabe, as the Finance Committee's convener, highlighted some of the sensible recommendations that are to be found in the report, out of which I have selected two that appear to me to be headline recommendations.</p><p>The first of those recommendations is that PPPs have made a valuable contribution to bringing about major public sector capital projects such as schools and hospitals. The second is that public bodies should consider the impact of PPP on employees so that workers' core employment conditions are protected. I will concentrate my remarks today on the latter point.</p><p>We can understand that employees in the private and public sectors become insecure when they hear talk about their transfer to another employer. Public sector workers, particularly blue-collar workers, have a right to be cynical about that process, as their experiences have been more than difficult. Compulsory competitive tendering equalled longer hours, less pay, and the loss of holidays and trade union rights. It is therefore essential for all those concerned in PPP projects that the work force is reassured that its interests will be protected.</p><p>A new building can be shiny and high tech but, without the commitment of skilled staff, service <place-holder colnum=\"16010\"/> improvements are unlikely to be sustained. People really matter in the process.</p><p>I am glad that the committee believes, as it sets out in paragraph 25 of its report, that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the improvements in service delivery that can be attributed at least in part to PPP should be secured in a way that does not impinge on the core employment conditions of workers employed in those projects.\"</p><p>I am also glad that the committee recognises and commends the Executive's commitment to getting rid of the two-tier work force, and I join it in that.</p><p>The announcement by the Minister for Finance and Public Services of 26 November, that workers on a local authority contract will have statutory protection of their terms and conditions, is welcome. It builds on the protocol that has been agreed between the Executive and the trade unions to end the scope for a two-tier work force in all future PPP projects in Scotland. Now, anyone who works for the council and is transferred to a private company will have their terms and conditions and pension protected, based on and better than the regulations on transfer of undertakings and protection of employment&#8212;TUPE.</p><p>As well as recommending the protection of workers' terms and conditions, the report argues that employees and their trade unions should be consulted at an early stage, given PPP's potential impact on staff. If we agree with the Minister for Finance and Public Services that we need to work with people at the front line and that their support and hard work is crucial, constructive consultation with the unions is essential. It is especially essential if we want to have in-house teams to bid against private companies, particularly in sectors such as catering and cleaning. I am confident that the trade unions will use the influence to the benefit of their members and to ensure the effective delivery of public services.</p><p>We need to recognise that good customer service and good terms and conditions for staff are not mutually exclusive. Local authority employees do not only deliver essential services. They live in their communities, and I am confident that they would want to bring about not only secure employment, but improved public services for themselves and their families.</p>", "hdate": "2002-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13284692", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public-private Partnerships"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words in the debate today.

I am confident that the fact that many members have remained in the chamber is testimony to their genuine interest in the issue and has nothing at all to do with their trying to avoid the cold callers who night after night interrupt their tea with promises of untold riches if they change their gas or electricity supplier. I hope that they find attending tonight's debate slightly better than doing an impression of the poor woman in the advert hiding in a cupboard under the stairs because she is frightened of the doorbell ringing. However, the lengths to which we will all go to avoid utility companies' sales agents suggest how low the utilities market has sunk in the public eye.</p><p>I make it clear at the outset that there is no doubt that people, particularly those on fixed incomes, can benefit from competition in the energy market. However, given some of the underhand doorstep selling tactics that are being used, it is no wonder that the industry has been brought into disrepute. We have all heard stories of aggressive, high-pressure selling, of sales agents tricking people into signing transfer agreements and of salesmen sitting in the public library with the electoral register filling out their forms. Such stories have understandably turned people off.</p><p>I have also heard stories from the other side of the doorstep. One former salesman shocked me with his account of the sharp practices that he was forced to employ to cajole customers into switching suppliers. He made a number of serious <place-holder colnum=\"15548\"/> allegations, including that he was given, without any police vetting, a fake identification card. I demanded that those allegations be fully investigated and I am thankful that the minister has informed me that his office has contacted the industry regulator and that the company in question is now under investigation.</p><p>Many in the chamber tonight could recount horror stories. It is easy enough to do that, but the key question is what we can do about the problem. I suggest the endorsement of three points. First, the industry watchdog, energywatch, as many members will be aware, is calling for the introduction of automatic minimum compensation payments for all cases of mis-selling and erroneous transfer. I back that measure. After all, if the energy companies are, as they say they are, in no mood to tolerate mis-selling and are driving it out of the industry, how could they possibly object? What better way is there for the companies to rebuild trust than by putting their money where their mouth is?</p><p>Secondly, I welcome initiatives such as EnergySure, which for the first time officially recognises and accredits energy sales teams. However, to concentrate on individual salespeople, however abusive or unscrupulous they might be, misses the bigger point. Earlier, I touched on the fact that some sales agencies that are subcontracted by the bigger power companies put their employees under intolerable pressure to hit targets. It is reported that such pressure can include telling employees to exaggerate or even lie about projected savings or encouraging them to sneak past wardens into sheltered housing complexes and to knock on doors after 8 o'clock, in breach of industry rules. An employer who treats workers in such a way is hardly likely to be concerned about an employee losing his or her job. Of course, when things go wrong, all the parties can blame one another. Therefore, I call on the power companies to take the next step, to recognise that the protection of the customer is paramount and to move away from using arm's-length agencies towards having accountable, in-house sales teams. That is the least that they can do.</p><p>Finally, we should consider what direct pressure we can apply on the power companies. Power companies are the partners with which we are delivering important anti-fuel-poverty schemes in Scotland, such as the warm deal and free central heating. How to square a company that works to reduce fuel poverty on the one hand and manipulates and exploits those on low incomes on the other hand is beyond me.</p><p>Gas and electricity companies have an obligation under condition 25 of their licence to produce information and advice on energy <place-holder colnum=\"15549\"/> efficiency. I suggest that, if they put information and advice at the forefront of their advertising campaigns rather than use discredited doorstep selling, perhaps they could repair the damage that has been done to their reputations. If we cannot trust them on the doorstep or on the telephone, how can we trust them on any energy efficiency advice that they give? How can we trust any scheme&#8212;even schemes that are run by the Executive&#8212;if companies that use sharp practices are involved? Mis-selling risks undermining the Executive's groundbreaking policies on fuel poverty.</p><p>I ask the minister to demand that companies stop undermining the Executive's work and face up to their licence obligations. Restoring faith in the energy market is in all our interests.

Average life expectancy is rising, fewer people are smoking and more mothers are breastfeeding. The increased investment to tackle heart disease and cancer is welcome and popular, but there is still a massive job to be done.</p><p>We will not win any popularity prizes by trying to encourage Scots to take more responsibility for their own health. Convincing people to stop smoking, reduce their alcohol intake or give up their pudding suppers is a challenge in a country that sometimes seems to be more interested in the health of its national football team than in the health of the nation. However, we must convince people to do such things, as prevention is better than cure.</p><p>The programme for action recognises that ill health is the final insult to those who are forced to endure poor housing, unemployment and low pay. Only the Executive recognises that ill health cannot be tackled in isolation. Tackling ill health means improving housing, ending low pay, tackling unemployment and working together in the Parliament and with our Westminster colleagues to ensure that we can and will do better for the people of Scotland.</p><p>That approach should be contrasted with the arguments of the nationalists. In Linda Fabiani's amendment and their speeches, the nationalists say that nothing is being done and that nothing can be done. The Tory amendment simply suggests that all that is required of vulnerable people is that they pull themselves up by their bootstraps&#8212;that is what the Tories mean. Thankfully, politicians in the Parliament came together as a coalition and put aside their political differences to ensure that the Parliament would deliver for the people of Scotland.

I seek assurance from the minister on that point.</p><p>I share the concerns of George Lyon and others about the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service. Like George Lyon, I have a strong constituency interest in the matter and have had regular meetings with, <place-holder colnum=\"14466\"/> and briefings from, ministers for some time. Lewis Macdonald has been left in no doubt about my disappointment with the content and timing of the announcement to reduce the passenger service.</p><p>It would be churlish not to welcome the continuation of the subsidy for the passenger service, but that is seen as a bit of a hollow victory and as one of those odd EU decisions, because a reduced service will be delivered for an increased subsidy. That is the sort of decision that brings the EU into disrepute.</p><p>I share George Lyon's concerns about the restriction of the route to passenger-only services. Inverclyde needs effective, attractive and efficient transport links. I fear that reduction to a passenger-only service will cause a breakdown in the use of ferry services. The Gourock to Dunoon route that links the centres of the towns connects with the existing rail service at Gourock and forms a direct link to the west of Scotland, Glasgow airport and the rest of the world.</p><p>As well as being a significant link between the two communities, the route is important for the local economies. The economic strategy of Inverclyde Council is to promote the area as a place of opportunity for substantial economic growth. It is keen to attract businesses, families and tourists. I understand that Argyll and Bute Council has similar initiatives. Therefore, it is important that the Executive makes clear its commitment to the future of the service over the longer term.</p><p>I also have some local concerns. The present facilities at Gourock include the CalMac headquarters, which provides the area with a wide range of highly valued, quality jobs. We do not wish those jobs to be put at risk.</p><p>George Lyon mentioned traffic congestion, which is already a problem for Gourock residents, with 110,000 cars and 9,000 heavy goods vehicles and coaches using its narrow roads. I concede that that existing problem will continue to be a problem irrespective of the decision that is taken. The problem is growing and must be acknowledged by Western Ferries at McInroy's Point.</p><p>Proposals for services for foot passengers only raise serious concerns among my constituents. I hope that the minister does not have a closed mind on that matter and that he will treat my constituents' concerns seriously and consider all the proposals in order to ensure the future of this important service.</p>", "hdate": "2002-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13280836", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ferry Services (Gourock to Dunoon)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank George Lyon for giving us the opportunity to debate the issue, but I regret that I cannot support his motion.

Like many others, I have recollections of images of the fire service and its impact on my life over the years. There were many fires and explosions in the Clyde shipyards. The abiding memory that I have is that, as we were running away from the danger, the professional firemen were running in. The debate gives us an opportunity to salute that professionalism.</p><p>Many of the images of the fire service&#8212;whether of New York, arc lights or firefighters attending accidents or fires&#8212;are dramatic, but I would like to concentrate on some of the less dramatic aspects of firefighters' work.</p><p>I welcome the renewed emphasis on fire prevention through work with the community, which the policy paper outlines. This might be a well-worn clich&#233;, and it has been used already today, but prevention is always better than cure. I encourage people to swap their chip pan for a deep fat fryer or to renew the batteries in their smoke alarms, as it could be argued that such steps are equally as important as a fast response time to house fires.</p><p>I welcome the policy paper's suggestions on how to develop fire prevention work. I note with interest that it proposes that fire services work with local authorities, the police and others in community safety partnerships to promote fire safety and that fire stations be opened up to act as a community focal point.</p><p>I want to mention Trish Godman's station at Port Glasgow and Greenock. The crews there are certainly engaged in their community. They were at a plant sale last Saturday and are often at charity events. They provide access and work in schools&#8212;their work is very visible.</p><p>Bob Wright, chairman of the Strathclyde Fire Brigade Preservation Group, told me that there is a combined fire brigade museum and community fire safety centre in Lauriston Place in Edinburgh. He argues&#8212;this is where the vested interest comes in&#8212;that the old fire station in Greenock could house a similar project for Strathclyde. He <place-holder colnum=\"11895\"/> suggests that it could be a focal point for fire prevention education, combined with a fun day out for children and young people, which would address some of the points that have been made. It could run practical initiatives for parents and sell smokeless ashtrays and discounted smoke alarms and provide advice about how and where to fit them. It could even start a chip pan trade-in scheme&#8212;who knows?</p><p>As with all such projects, funding is the key issue, but Bob Wright argues that housing the projects under one roof with private and voluntary sector involvement would make the scheme viable. Such a scheme is an ideal vehicle for driving forward some of the commendable proposals in the policy paper. I am confident that the Strathclyde Fire Brigade Preservation Group will make submissions during the consultation period. I hope, and expect, that its views will be taken into consideration.</p>", "hdate": "2002-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13274052", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Fire Service"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.

As he said, it is an issue that concerns many communities throughout Scotland, in particular communities that were formerly dependent on heavy industries.</p><p>One such area is my constituency, Greenock and Inverclyde. That is hardly a surprise if we consider the speed of decline in shipbuilding there in the late 1970s and in the 1980s. James Lamont and Company of Port Glasgow closed in 1979; the Greenock Dockyard Company closed in 1980; George Brown and Company of Greenock closed in 1983; Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock closed in 1984; and Lithgow's of Port Glasgow closed in 1988&#8212;not to mention Kincaid's engine works. That industrial vandalism ripped the heart out of the community and left us with mass unemployment, widespread deprivation and precious few prospects.</p><p>If Shakespeare will forgive my murdering of his verse, \"I come to praise Inverclyde, not to bury it.\" Despite the collapse of traditional industry, progress has been made. The local work force has retrained and reskilled. We have achieved the status of manufacturing export capital of Scotland, and we made the transition from building ships to making microchips. Unemployment is low, and the number of employed is very high. Our educational attainment levels are, according to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education, among the best in the country. The number of my constituents who are in full-time higher education is now 2.4 per cent above the national average, and the number of people who are in further education is nearly 11 per cent above the national average.</p><p>There has been a dramatic redevelopment of <place-holder colnum=\"10131\"/> our waterfront, as was witnessed by the 800,000 visitors to the area during the tall ships event. We have attracted such companies as One 2 One, as well as the Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage centre, to complement the more established major employers such as IBM and National Semiconductors. House prices in Gourock, for example, have risen by 69 per cent since 1991, and Wemyss Bay and Inverkip are growing so quickly that the local public services are having to work very hard to keep up.</p><p>Despite that progress, the perception of decline remains. That perception plays a big part in one of the key challenges that Inverclyde faces today: a decline in population. We are making progress, and are looking for light whenever it is there. The most recent population projections have been revised upwards, with the figures showing that the rate of decline is stabilising.</p><p>However, the challenges remain. The question now is how to reverse the trend. First, we must examine what pushes people away. There is no doubt that the jobs issue plays a part, but it is not simply a question of the number of jobs available, but of their quality. We cannot build and sustain communities on low-paid, low-skill temporary employment. We need to understand the needs of existing employers in electronics and in financial services, to convert some of our derelict land for inward investment and to realise the massive opportunities for tourism and leisure. Our successful James Watt College of Further and Higher Education will be a key player in that process.</p><p>The regeneration game must take the form of a package deal. To make Inverclyde a place of choice, we need to create a pleasant and safe place to live. We need to provide affordable, high-quality housing across all sectors, and in areas where people wish to live. Parents need to know that their children will be well educated in a warm, comfortable classroom that is fit for teaching in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Our environment must be improved and our brownfield sites must be redeveloped.</p><p>Crime and the fear of crime can push people away from a community. For that reason, it is important that we crack down on crime and tackle anti-social behaviour. We in Inverclyde will do our very best to ensure that permanent and terminal decline is not our fate.</p>", "hdate": "2002-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13269367", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Colin Campbell for giving us the opportunity to discuss regeneration.

The \"Greenock Tele\", as it is called, acts as a focal point for community life. It chronicles the hatches, dispatches and matches in the church and on the football field, academic achievements, court reports and other public events.</p><p>Local newspapers provide a level of scrutiny of local elected representatives, such as ourselves, that broadcast and other national media cannot provide. However much we rant and rave about how local newspapers cover a specific story, we <place-holder colnum=\"932\"/> know in our heart of hearts that what they do is good for democracy and the political process. Local papers also help people who have left the area, and even the country, to keep in touch.</p><p>I write a short column in the <em>Greenock Telegraph</em> every week about the goings-on in this place. The column has my e-mail address at the bottom and I am amazed by the number of e-mails that I receive from Greenockians working, for example, for IBM in America, for an engineering company in Canada or in the construction industry in Italy. They read the paper, seek my opinions and want to keep in touch with what is happening locally and in the Scottish Parliament. We have had relatives making inquiries and representations from Canada about the care of an elderly uncle. That was brought about by new technology and the local newspaper.</p><p>It would be remiss of me&#8212;given that we have just discussed the Rankin maternity unit and given my involvement in the shipbuilding industry through its decline&#8212;not to mention local newspapers' campaigning role. They have the resources and local knowledge to run campaigns that bring matters of local concern to the attention of the public.</p><p>Local papers have another crucial role: they are a window on their community. They give us a unique opportunity to present all that is positive within our area to a wider audience. That is assisted by Scottish Television's lunch time \"Scotland Today\" and BBC Scotland's \"Newsdrive\", both of which review local papers daily. I welcome that. It would be in everybody's interest if more of that was done, including a review of the many weekly titles in Scotland.</p><p>The <em>Greenock Telegraph</em> was launched on 18 March 1857, at a price of 2d. It was originally published every Wednesday and Saturday. Two years later, the paper started to be published three times a week and the price was halved to a penny&#8212;newspaper wars indeed.</p><p>In 1863, the paper became Britain's first halfpenny daily newspaper. That caused others, such as the <em>North and</em> <em>South Shields Gazette</em>, <em>The Evening Citizen </em>in Glasgow, <em>The Echo </em>in<em> </em>London, the <em>Belfast Telegraph</em> and the <em>Paisley Express</em> to follow suit, which did a great deal to bring cheap, reliable newspapers to the British people.</p><p>For 144 years, the <em>Greenock Telegraph</em>, with its unique local angle, has reported many historic events: emigration from Scotland to the new world; both world wars; Greenock's blitz; the dark days when the yards closed; and countless general and local elections.</p><p>When I looked through some back copies of the <em>Greenock Telegraph, </em>I found a public notice from the 1946 general election that may be of interest, <place-holder colnum=\"933\"/> given that there is much discussion about apathy in elections. The advertisement invited members of the public to book their tickets, at 1s 6d a time, to hear Ernest Bevin at Cappielow park. Such was the demand that an overflow meeting was organised next door to be addressed by the local candidate, Hector McNeil. These are changed days indeed.</p><p>When we read the more everyday stories, we get a real insight into how life in our community was all those years ago. For example, reading the court pages from those days, I was surprised at how many people were imprisoned for their beliefs: they believed that a night watchman was sleeping or they believed that the woman's husband was on night shift. There are some entertaining stories.</p><p>Keeping pace with changes in technology, the paper is now printed daily and in colour. The figures show that&#8212;despite the challenges imposed by television, radio and the internet&#8212;Inverclyde people still turn to the \"Tele\" for their night's news.</p><p>On the display board in the lobby of our office block, there is a quotation to the effect that an effective Parliament relies on informed people.

It creates more job security, and in return for treating workers as an asset rather than an expense, management is rewarded with a confident, flexible, highly skilled and highly paid work force, which can give its company the edge in the global market place.

How better can we take the opportunity to remember that on the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Clydebank blitz, when those ordinary Clydeside men and women faced terrible adversity and overcame it, at home and on the front line? The fact that that generation <place-holder colnum=\"537\"/> had the courage to stand up to tyranny and fight for what was right gave us the country that we live in today. Were it not for their sacrifice, everything that we take for granted would be a fading memory: freedom, tolerance, security and even the critical daily newspapers.</p><p>Clydebank and Greenock had much in common: both were centres of heavy industry. It was only a matter of time before my constituency was on the Luftwaffe's hit list. The Greenock blitz began just after midnight on 6 May 1941, when 50 German planes scattered bombs indiscriminately over the town. Thankfully, damage and casualties were relatively light, but we were not so lucky the following night. Sirens sounded at 12.15 am, heralding the arrival of the first wave of bombers, which dropped incendiary bombs outside the perimeter of the town. That created a ring of fire around the target area.</p><p>The second wave concentrated on the east end and the centre of the town. One of the first buildings to take a hit was the Ingleston Street distillery, which became a huge, flaming beacon for the rest of the bombers. A third wave of bombers flew in at about 2 am. This time they dropped parachute landmines and heavy high explosives, which caused widespread damage.</p><p>Between 250 and 300 German planes took part in the attack. When the all-clear sounded at 3.30 am, most of the town was ablaze. Locals emerged to see that both sugar refineries had been hit by landmines, Rankin and Blackmore's foundry was badly damaged and several churches were left as shells. Out of 18,000 homes, 10,000 were damaged and 1,000 of those were destroyed.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, the assumed main target&#8212;the shipyards&#8212;escaped lightly. Only Lamont's dry dock and Scott's head office were hit. Thankfully, the previous night's more sporadic attack had caused much of the population to leave the town. My father, for example, went to Inverkip. My mother was disappointed to be taken off the bus and home again by her father; I do not know what that told her, but that is what happened. Nevertheless, those two nights left 280 people dead and 1,200 injured.</p><p>When we discuss the issue with younger people, they may say, \"That was 60 years ago. What does it have to do with living in Greenock today?\" It is manifest that Greenock has changed in the past six decades. The heavy industry has been replaced with high-tech manufacturing and the service sector. The shipbuilders are now chip-builders; the dockers are now data managers; and we have gone from working on the banks of the Clyde to banks online.</p><p>However, there are still threats to our community&#8212;not from Hitler, but from heroin; not <place-holder colnum=\"538\"/> from global war, but from global competition. If we are to meet those challenges and to defeat those threats and not to fall victim to them, we would do well to follow the example of those ordinary men and women of 60 years ago. The fact that they could hold their community together through the horror of the blitz and then build it again afterwards should be an inspiration as a testament to what the human spirit can achieve.</p><p>Tonight's debate allows us to celebrate that generation's spirit and resolve in the face of adversity.

Throughout the committee's discussions, and in our debate in the chamber today, much of the attention has focused on higher education and support for university students. That should not, I suppose, be surprising, since many MSPs are from social <place-holder colnum=\"753\"/> classes that traditionally send their children into higher education. Many sections of the media also belong to that group. The interests of higher education therefore have a powerful voice in Scotland and have been well represented in the debate.</p><p>The unfortunate consequence of that focus, however, is that further education colleges have yet again been cast as the cinderellas of education: their problems, and those of their students, are all too often eclipsed by the problems of their more glamorous sisters. As someone who benefited from second-chance learning, I want to redress the balance a little by reminding the chamber, if I may, of the merits of further education, which, unsurprisingly, is an agenda that is close to my heart.</p><p>I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to realise his or her full potential, regardless of social or economic background. The policy of widening access to further education so that it is no longer the preserve of the better-off must be a top priority. The need to widen access is clear. Although higher education expanded rapidly during the early 1990s, there continues to be a social divide. More than half the youngsters from well-off families go on to higher education, while only 10 per cent of youngsters from the lowest income groups do so. This is where FE colleges come in. If someone comes from a background where, as bright as they may be, going to university is more daunting than a trip to the moon, they need a stepping-stone to help them to keep learning. The lack of access to further education for working people represents a barrier to a modern and dynamic Scotland.</p><p>If we are to realise our ambitions in government, the situation must improve. We cannot deliver economic stability and prosperity, social justice or a knowledge economy without developing the skills and abilities of our work force. Promoting FE colleges is vital to our social justice agenda and a vibrant FE sector is essential if our economy is to continue to grow. On its visit to IBM at Greenock, the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee witnessed a demonstration of that point. Although there is an international call centre there, we have to import people with language skills to staff it.</p><p>The bill begins to address the issues that I have outlined. Students studying higher education courses in FE colleges will receive clear benefits. Higher national students will be exempt from paying the endowment. The anomaly of parental contributions for school leavers starting on a further education course in comparison to those for school leavers from the same background starting on a higher education course, which has existed for many years, is addressed by the alignment of further education student support with <place-holder colnum=\"754\"/> that for higher education. All mature students, lone parents and students with a disability will receive their education completely free. How is that for opportunity for all? I welcome the bill as it will help to expand access to further education and thereby deliver economic and social benefits.</p>", "hdate": "2001-01-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13244161", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) (No 2) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a former member of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee I appreciate the opportunity to speak, despite the fact that that opportunity arises because of the illness of my friend and colleague Marilyn Livingstone.

I appreciate the support that I have had from back benchers from all parties.</p><p>Members will be glad to know that I will use the term \"mesothelioma\" sparingly, which will save me any embarrassment and spare the official reporters. However, I will use the term sparingly not only for those selfish reasons. Mesothelioma is a clinical and sterile term, which masks the true nature of a most painful and unpleasant form of cancer. That should not be hidden behind a word that is difficult to pronounce. Mesothelioma is a cancer of the lining of the lung. It is aggressive, painful and there is no cure. The victim is dead within 12 months.</p><p>The members of Clydeside Action on Asbestos who are sitting in the public gallery know only too well that a clinical medical term cannot describe the pain and suffering experienced by the victims of this disease. Unlike other major Clydeside industrial illnesses, such as deafness and welder's lung, exposure to asbestos did not only affect the workers themselves. Asbestos fibres that were brought into the home on overalls and in hair also damaged wives and children. I am aware of a case of a woman who was a bus conductress, who took shipyard workers to and from work. She had never been in a shipyard in her life, but she contracted cancer from asbestos on her passengers' overalls.</p><p>Mesothelioma is a huge problem. It affects more people than cervical cancer, and the death toll will double by 2020. Unfortunately, scientists believe that what they call the mesothelioma epidemic has not reached its peak.<place-holder colnum=\"223\"/></p><p>Mesothelioma is more than a medical condition. On top of the pain and suffering and the anger and bitterness at having a terminal illness that could have been prevented, and on top of someone's guilt over possibly having damaged the health of their wife and children, there is a final insult that should be at the heart of this evening's debate: these cancer victims are being denied justice. I am not a legal expert, but I know that employers continued to expose their workers to asbestos long after the dangers of doing so became known. As a result, those workers are now dying an agonising death. In my book, there is a clear case to answer for that.</p><p>Unfortunately, when the victims try to claim compensation through the courts, those who defend the actions&#8212;the employers and the insurance companies&#8212;prolong their agony on spurious grounds. In researching this topic, I have been given information about a past case in which the legal representatives of a former shipyard worker who died of the disease made detailed submissions on the circumstances in which he was exposed to asbestos. Those submissions describe which shipyard he worked in, which contracts he worked on, the dates of his employment and the names of the friends and colleagues who worked with him.</p><p>In spite of the submissions, the defendants simply denied everything. They denied that the man was employed by them. They denied the existence of his friends and colleagues. They denied that the ships were built and even denied that the shipyards existed. In such cases, the victims are told that they never existed. What effect must it have on a person in the last few months of their life to be told that they never existed? Why should the legal representatives of the victims repeatedly have to prove to successive courts that the QE2 was built at John Brown's, Clydebank, in 1968? It sounds ludicrous, but that is happening in Scotland in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>Of course, such spurious arguments can be disproved in a court of law, but that takes time and terminally ill people do not have time. I do not want to get emotional, but I suggest that&#8212;as a way of fighting back&#8212;we dedicate tonight's debate to Mr Lilly, whom members might have seen on the television programme \"Frontline Scotland\" recently. Owen Lilly was a former asbestos factory worker who suffered from mesothelioma. He died on Tuesday. His case was not scheduled to come to court until April 2001. What justice is there for Owen Lilly?</p><p>That is the reality: that cynical sharp practice denies victims the right to a jury, to interim payments and to other expenses that are incurred through having a terminal illness. If we are to move towards real justice for the victims, their <place-holder colnum=\"224\"/> cases must be resolved through the civil legal process as a matter of urgency and priority. We must remove the obstacles that cause delays and prevent such cases from being heard by a jury. The victims want juries, not judges. We must provide the victims with much-needed short-term assistance and review the powers and procedures of the courts, to enable them to receive interim payments pending final resolution of their cases.</p><p>I am pleased that 44 back benchers from all parties have supported the motion and thank the members who have stayed behind to listen to the debate. I hope that the Parliament has sent a strong message to those involved in the justice system that the way that the system currently deals with mesothelioma sufferers is not acceptable to us and that we look forward to supporting them effectively.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13239068", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mesothelioma"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be debating this motion today.

I also thank the Morton supporters for their serious campaign to meet the challenge that the club faces. Some of those supporters are in the gallery this evening. <i>[Applause.]</i> However, they were beaten to it by members of the Argyll and Bute youth forum who at lunchtime today handed out leaflets from Cowal Morton supporters asking for the club to be saved.</p><p>In 1874, the people of a thriving industrial Clyde coast town established their own football club. Now, after a century and a quarter, Greenock Morton Football Club faces its greatest ever challenge. It has no manager, a crumbling stadium, only four players and a majority shareholder who has lost the confidence of the fans. Make no mistake, the club is facing a serious crisis. However, the debate is not just about Morton, or just about football; it is about a community, its assets and our right to have a say in how those are run.</p><p>The club is in trouble&#8212;that is not at issue. Only yesterday, a morning newspaper told us that the Scottish Football Association was ordering the club to pay the &#163;19,000 that it owes Heart of Midlothian Football Club or face expulsion from the league. The books are to be opened and the majority shareholder has been invited to attend Tuesday's SFA executive committee meeting. I agree with the Morton legend, Allan McGraw, <place-holder colnum=\"457\"/> when he says that, although the financial probe is welcome, expulsion would deal a severe blow to the club. Indeed, many fans have made that point in the past few days. The SFA must have regard to the best interests of the club and must not&#8212;whatever Hugh Scott may or may not have done&#8212;expel the club from the league. To do so might destroy the club for good.</p><p>The bond of trust between the club and the fans has been broken&#8212;even to the extent that threats have been issued to close Morton \"like the shipyards\". That is a far cry from the 10,000-seat stadium and a team aiming for the Premier League, which the fans were promised when the current majority shareholder arrived. The irony is that, by welcoming inward investment and new opportunities, the local area has moved on from those dark days when we lost the shipyards. However, at Morton, it has been a case of broken promises and missed opportunities.</p><p>Despite such problems, a great deal of good will remains towards the club. The fans in the public gallery and those who were here at lunchtime, who have made the trip from Inverclyde and beyond, all want to safeguard the future of this 126-year-old community asset. There is genuine feeling that something must be done. The Scottish Parliament is the appropriate forum in which to put that case.</p><p>As one Morton fan said to me yesterday, \"If politicians truly believe that local football teams are good for our communities, will they stand by while one man brings embarrassment and disgrace to this community?\" I hope that the debate will send a strong signal to politicians that they cannot stand by and watch community assets be lost for ever.</p><p>We all know how easy it is to bemoan the performance of those who are in charge of our local clubs&#8212;doing that is an art form on a Saturday evening&#8212;but if we are to move forward, we must propose constructive solutions.</p><p>Before we can begin to work towards those solutions, we must recognise that community-based football clubs cannot be run as if they were supermarkets. If Rangers Football Club closed down tomorrow, the great and the good of Govan could not switch to Rangers' main competitor for their football. We cannot treat community assets such as football clubs as ordinary private businesses. Owners of such assets have a brand loyalty that would be the envy of many. That point was underlined in a report that I read yesterday from the Scottish independent supporters coalition, which said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Supporters are the essential lifeblood of the game. They are more than just customers or consumers. They support their club almost from the cradle to the grave and will not take their support or 'custom' elsewhere even if the quality <place-holder colnum=\"458\"/> of the team they support deteriorates. They aspire for success but their loyalty is not conditional on this. They are genuine stakeholders in their clubs and deserve to be treated as such. If supporters become alienated or excluded from their clubs, they will continue to support the club but will simply stop going to games and purchasing merchandise. As they will not&#8212;and indeed by definition cannot&#8212;go elsewhere, their involvement and spending power is lost to the game as a whole.\"</p><p>Another point, made by Tony Higgins, the secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers Association, is that football clubs are companies that receive funds from people other than those who pay at the turnstiles. People do not need to go through the turnstiles to put money into the chairman's wallet&#8212;if people have Sky television, buy a lottery ticket, or pay their council tax or income tax, they give money to football clubs. As a press release today confirmed, Morton has received &#163;500,000 and has been offered another &#163;600,000 in a package for further improvements.</p><p>The football authorities must recognise that point about funds and modernise their articles of association to take account of it and protect our community clubs. Failure to make the distinction between consumers and other sources of funding has unfortunate consequences, of which Morton fans are all too well aware. Under the current system, Hugh Scott can basically do what he likes. If he is successful in closing down Morton, there are many other businessmen who could, and would, do the same thing to other clubs. Therein lies the nub of the issue: today, our local club is under threat from a hard-nosed businessman, but tomorrow it could be yours.</p><p>If we accept that football clubs are different from other limited companies, how do we take the issue forward? It has been suggested that legislation should be put in place to prevent businessmen from chairing football clubs purely for financial gain. Others argue that it must be ensured that, in future, all community-based clubs are just that; local councils and Government must be involved, along with supporters and owners, to ensure that people such as Hugh Scott cannot do what they like.</p><p>It is time to move to protect the interests of our community assets. If we are serious about protecting our community clubs, we must consider the safeguarding of supporters' interests. In the short term, however, we must address the situation at Morton. I have refrained, until now, from calling for the resignation of the majority shareholder, Hugh Scott, but he is proving to be a significant obstacle to progress. A leading supporter summed it up when he said, \"Hugh Scott has upset and argued with the SFA, the Scottish Football League, the local council, local police, the local press, Hearts, Clyde, St Mirren and Dunfermline&#8212;not to mention the support.\"</p>", "hdate": "2000-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13231083", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Greenock Morton Football Club"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank those members who were able to stay for tonight's debate.

There is no single response to globalisation and modernisation&#8212;it cuts across large sections of our society and the economy. Our success or failure in the future will depend on our ability to adapt swiftly and effectively to change.</p><p>Part of that strategy will depend on having a highly skilled work force with the transferable skills and flexibility that will enable it to adapt to market changes. We must also embrace the knowledge economy. I hope that that will allow us to take advantage of changes, rather than fall victim to them.</p><p>To achieve the knowledge economy, we must <place-holder colnum=\"1165\"/> deliver lifelong learning. That must be done not only through schools and colleges, but through a much-neglected area&#8212;the workplace. ILAs provide a significant opportunity. The chief executive of SUFI, Frank Pignatelli, has said that there is an opportunity to make Scotland competitive through its people.</p><p>There is wide recognition of the potential for ILAs to make a major contribution to the development of the culture of lifelong learning. There is, however, also recognition that there are issues about delivery. There are a number of potential barriers to access&#8212;I hope that we will address them during the passage of the bill&#8212;that can be addressed through personal contribution and a willingness to be involved. Some can be addressed through sponsorship, either by an employer or by a trade union.</p><p>As has been mentioned&#8212;and as will be mentioned again&#8212;there are issues relating to those who live in remote areas. There are also issues to do with providing guidance and support for those who are not naturally inclined to return to education and training&#8212;people who find it practically impossible to do that because they are working long hours or shift-working, people with child care requirements, or people who simply do not have the bus fare at the end of the week. We must ensure that those least likely to learn get their share of the cash. We also need to address the issue of employers using the funds to subsidise existing training budgets.</p><p>However, those are mere details. The principle of the bill&#8212;or lack of principle, as Fergus Ewing would have it&#8212;and its aims and objectives are important. I am sure that we will return at a later stage to many of the issues that I mentioned.</p><p>Let us be positive. As the most positive member of the most positive committee in the Parliament&#8212;I do not know why SNP members are smiling at that&#8212;I say that we must reject the cynicism that leads people to dismiss SUFI as a phone-a-friend helpline. We must see this initiative as a catalyst for bringing about the partnerships that we need. ILAs are not just about payment for training. They can achieve far more than that, by creating partnerships in the workplace and the community, and by promoting the learning culture that is vital to our success.</p><p>We must also convince employers and employees to invest and participate in education and training. We need to make it possible for them to do that. We need to increase the number of companies that offer training, education and personal development opportunities. Perhaps the debate on the bill will help us to achieve that. Rather than approaching the issue negatively, we should try to open up the best training initiatives offered by employers to employees' families and <place-holder colnum=\"1166\"/> to the wider community. We could give them more money to train more people.</p><p>The goal must be to provide opportunities to people, so that they can escape low-paid, low-skill, dead-end jobs and start careers that increase their income and job satisfaction. The right to access is another issue. We must provide learning centres in supermarkets, workplaces and community halls, as well as in schools and colleges. We can use the bill to build and develop access. If we take a positive attitude, we can ensure that education and training do not end at the school gates and deliver lifelong learning for all.</p>", "hdate": "2000-05-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13229394", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Education and Training (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you.

I think I have time to tell a story from that time. Because of the good value a local contractor appeared to offer, an employer got him in to do a wee paint job. The contractor used lead paints that invaded the integrity of the factory's safety system, creating a toxic mix. Forty-three people went to hospital. Almost every service was involved: the ambulance service, the police service, the NHS, the benefits system and, eventually, the justice system. The cost was enormous&#8212;for the people who were injured, for the company and from the loss of productivity. There was a substantial financial loss.</p><p>I mention that case because it underlines the fact that industrial accidents and diseases bear a high cost&#8212;to the employer, to the individuals affected and to society. They are preventable and they have a considerable impact on the services that are devolved to this Parliament.</p><p>I believe that the Scottish Parliament has a role to play in shaping the work programme of the Health and Safety Executive in Scotland, as the <place-holder colnum=\"1276\"/> type of employment in Scotland differs from that elsewhere in the UK. We have moved from the very obvious health hazards of the shipbuilding and steel industries to the less obvious hazards of the new so-called sunrise industries, which deal with chemicals.</p><p>Women in my constituency are fighting for recognition of the effect of glycol ethers on their lives and their children's lives over the past several years. The workplace is changing and is different in different parts of the country. We should expect the work of the Health and Safety Executive to reflect what is happening in Scotland, and this Parliament should have some say in its work programme and priorities.</p><p>The debate is not just about the HSE's funding; it is about what we add on. We should not expect the HSE to take full responsibility for health and safety in Scotland. We need to graft on a role for health boards, trade unions and the community. The Health and Community Care Committee may also have a role. Last week, the Minister for Health and Community Care told us that the Executive is to invest a great deal of money in prevention. People in my constituency are still paying the price for what went wrong in the shipbuilding industry in the past. We are footing the bill for problems with asbestos, welder's lung, beat knee and noise-induced deafness. If we want to avoid that in the future, the Health and Community Care Committee must consider health and safety issues.</p><p>I know that the Justice and Home Affairs Committee is busy and will not thank me for this, but it could look into why prosecution rates are low and why, when we prosecute, we fail to get successful results.

In recent years, Inverclyde in general, and Greenock in particular, have overcome many of the problems that were the result of the decline of the traditional industries.<place-holder colnum=\"262\"/></p><p>We are now beginning to recover. We used to build ships; we now build microchips and computers. We continue to succeed in attracting major high-tech investment&#8212;IBM has its base in Greenock, and One2One and National Semiconductor are also there, to name just three. They have all invested heavily in Greenock. Empty shipyards have been turned into mortgage centres; derelict docks have been replaced with the college campus; and unemployment and degeneration have been replaced by new jobs and fresh opportunities.</p><p>When I look at how far we have come, I am proud of our achievements. We have begun to reverse the decline and have taken the first real steps along the road to sustainable prosperity. However, I feel apprehensive. I am concerned that all the hard work of the people of Greenock could be for nothing, and that we could end up back where we started. The reason can be summed up in a single word&#8212;water. It seems that every time we have heavy rain in Greenock, transport links are cut and we become Scotland's newest island. That poses a threat to our local economy and is simply not good enough for the export capital of Scotland. The significance of that cannot be overplayed.</p><p>Let us be absolutely clear what we are talking about: this is not a debate about a few minor roads in a housing scheme being closed, as inconvenient as that might be, and as real as the problems might be to constituents; we are talking about the A8&#8212;the only route in and out of the area&#8212;being impassable. That raises the stakes. Rather than bemoaning a hindrance, we are talking about a real threat to investment, jobs and continued regeneration.</p><p>Last summer, approximately half a million visitors attended the Tall Ships event and saw with their own eyes the giant strides that our community and our area have taken. They saw the new Inverclyde and went away with a positive image, which put us on the map as a tourist and leisure area. But what would have happened if we had had a wet weekend? Only a fraction of those visitors would have been able to attend, denying us all those benefits.</p><p>Many parts of the constituency are affected by the problem. We will shortly have an improved and expanded marina at Inverkip, which will address our niche market of sailing. How can we maximise that development's potential and convince those who might wish to use it to berth their yacht when we cannot even guarantee that it will be open 52 weekends of the year?</p><p>There has also been a huge expansion in housing in the Wemyss Bay and Inverkip areas. Those houses are essential to address the long-term depopulation that damages Inverclyde's <place-holder colnum=\"263\"/> economic viability. Isolating those new developments would leave hundreds of people stranded. It would keep workers from their place of business, pupils from schools and would-be consumers from the Oak mall and the Waterfront complex.</p><p>Gourock is a transport hub with connections to Glasgow and the islands. What future will the exciting new developments at Gourock have if we do not get the transport links sorted? Greenock is also hard hit. People who work in courts, schools, the emergency services, businesses and many other places all suffer extreme inconvenience and financial loss. I will return to those issues later.</p><p>Not only the roads are affected. Water running down from the hills to the sea has caused railway stations to close and has risked undermining the track. If Inverclyde is cut off, the damage to commerce is significant. Every day, 10,000 people commute from Inverclyde and 7,000 come in&#8212;so 17,000 people are on the move twice a day, yet the road link is not secure. That figure excludes non-commuter commercial traffic. Deliveries to and dispatches from various businesses must also be made daily.</p><p>At the moment there are several semi-derelict sites that are crying out for redevelopment, with the potential to deliver jobs and to attract investment. How can we attract companies to a site that is rendered inaccessible every winter because of flooding? I am full of admiration for the invest in Inverclyde campaign, but selling an underwater business park is beyond even the talents of those who run the campaign.</p><p>Furthermore, the threat to the retention and expansion of investment is not the only issue raised by the flooding. Local businesses, public services, emergency services, councils, official bodies and others are subject to inconvenience, disruption and financial loss.</p><p>I must admit that on the morning on which I was stranded I had no appreciation of the number of agencies and services that must be mobilised in such situations. However, as I sat, stranded in my car, on the morning of Tuesday 30 November&#8212;the day of the last severe flood&#8212;I saw police officers, firefighters and workers from the local council and West of Scotland Water all striving in abject conditions to alleviate the problem. I feel that it is necessary to put on record that this debate is in no way a criticism of the efforts of those workers. I congratulate them on their efforts. Indeed, I only missed a couple of meetings, while they struggled with the elements.</p><p>The police have confirmed that 40 police man hours are wasted in setting up diversions and roadblocks every time the A8 floods. That is 40 hours that would be much better spent fighting <place-holder colnum=\"264\"/> crime. Money is being poured down the drain. The local chamber of commerce has also expressed concern over the cost to businesses from part closures of the A8.</p><p>Glenbrae Children's Centre was flooded not once, but twice during November. The first flood, on 4 November, caused &#163;9,000-worth of damage and the centre was closed for a week. The second flood,.on 30 November, was more serious. The centre was closed down and the children farmed out to other accommodation.</p><p>Have I run over my time?</p>", "hdate": "2000-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13218737", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Inverclyde (Flooding)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is okay.

I do not know whether this is appropriate, but I would like to announce that, yesterday afternoon in Harrow, my daughter gave birth to my first granddaughter.

I felt that in this family-friendly Parliament, I could not miss the opportunity to make that announcement. <i>[Applause.]</i></p><p>That applause has just spurred me on, so I will continue with an apology. I have never participated in or witnessed a public school debate and I have never been to Australia. However, I have been forced to debate my arguments and present my case in shipyards on the Clyde, in the bottling halls of Dumbarton and in the mills of Falkirk and Grangemouth. There were no formal rules, but if people made personal attacks on others they were more likely to get a black eye than a debate. That rarely happened, although sometimes people got a sore nose. The basic rule was that if someone was talking nonsense, they were told that they were talking nonsense. Much nonsense has been talked-or has been reported-during the past few weeks. I think that we all feel relief today that we are now reaching a sense of purpose about the business of the Parliament and are getting down to it. </p><p>The First Minister's statement set out a programme that we can all support and that understands the power of education. We should all rally behind it, as I hope we will. The programme will raise expectations-rightly so, because the expectations of the people whom I represent are extremely low. </p><p>I hope that, as was said this morning, the programme will support the regeneration of our economy. Some people say that we need a bill before Parliament to discuss unemployment or to tackle the problems of redundancies and jobs. However, we did not need a bill or a debate to send a task force into Govan, which the workers were discussing this morning. I hope that the task force will bear fruit for the more than 200 people in my constituency who depend on the Kvaerner <place-holder colnum=\"478\"/> Govan yard for their livelihood. </p><p>I welcome the First Minister's stated priority of targeting heart disease and cancer. Greenock and Inverclyde have a high incidence of disease and ill health, which needs to be fought relentlessly. I also welcome the priority of building strong and stable communities that are not overshadowed by the fear of crime. We do not need to have legislation in place to attack drugs, but drugs are the big issue on the streets and we must get a grip of the situation. We know that drug-related crime is up and that drug-related deaths are on the increase. </p><p>Against that background, the need for action cannot be questioned. A lot can be done through education, as Trish Godman said, and by providing rehabilitation centres where there are none for people who want to come off drugs. I say to Phil Gallie that where there are no places in a rehabilitation centre, people come through your back window. The issue needs to be addressed urgently. If we address it and some of the other issues, I am confident that my constituents will support the priorities of the Parliament and the programme. </p>", "hdate": "1999-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13207537", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was anxious to speak today for a selfish reason.
