The necessity of having a balanced budget is a fact that the Labour Party in particular often seems to forget. Over the past few months, we have heard a very long wish list of increased spending that the Labour Party would like to see, but as usual it will not tell us what it would cut in order to fund that expensive list&#8212;except, of course, that there is the vague and lingering threat of Johann Lamont&#8217;s cuts commission, where everything is apparently still on the table.

Scotland&#8217;s unemployment rate is now down to 6.4 per cent&#8212;well below the UK average&#8212;which not only demonstrates this Government&#8217;s economic competence, but underscores the fact that that has been achieved despite, and certainly not because of, George Osborne&#8217;s austerity agenda.

It is important to heed those complaints. Not only are small businesses important in terms of the amount of employment that they create in aggregate, but some of the small businesses of today will become the big businesses and big employers of tomorrow. One of the problems in our economy is that that progression of small businesses growing into big businesses happens all too rarely. The economists call it a lack of churn. Today&#8217;s fat cats need to be constantly challenged by tomorrow&#8217;s fat cats&#8212;today&#8217;s lean and hungry cats. That is how we will drive innovation and improve productivity and how we will remain competitive. If we want to provide higher quality employment, tackle unemployment, and improve the fortunes of the working poor we need to listen carefully to and support small businesses.</p><p>A further misconception that has featured in our discussions is the apparent belief that most businesses wilfully break regulations and wish to damage the environment.

I would particularly like to thank those who gave evidence in private and who shared with us their difficult and painful experiences as they wrestled with their debts and with a system for dealing with those situations that is not always as good as it could be.</p><p>It became apparent when taking that evidence that most of the people who fall into debt do so not because they lack ability in balancing their budgets or controlling their finances, but through misfortune and events beyond their control. Like the committee, I welcome the bill because it is necessary to update and improve the processes for dealing with debt and seek ways to be fairer to creditors and debtors. I fully support the bill&#8217;s aim to ensure that appropriate and proportionate debt management and debt relief mechanisms that are fit for the 21st century are available to the people of Scotland.</p><p>There has been some criticism from Opposition members that the legislative programme for this year is insubstantial, that Scotland is on pause and that bills such as this are unimportant. I was sorry to hear Jenny Marra, for instance, suggest that this afternoon. However, like me, I think that my fellow members on the committee would disagree with that view and would wish to refute it.</p><p>The bill amends the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1985. Imagine if we were restricted to running our computers on the software available in 1985. To the extent that legislation is like a society&#8217;s software, most members would agree on the need to update and amend legislation when we become aware of faults and where improvements can be found. The bill might seem to be unimportant, but only to someone who is fortunate enough not to be in difficulty with debt or to someone who is not unlucky enough to be a creditor who has not been paid.</p><p>During our scrutiny, it became obvious to the committee that this is a complex and technical bill. That means that there is all the more need for advice to be mandatory for those seeking the most appropriate debt solution and not merely the solution that is most convenient for their trustee.</p><p>Along with that, there is a necessity for that advice to be consistent, and that is why it is important that there should be only one debt tool. Although I am sure that the other tools have merit, no one was able to explain to the committee what their superior merit was and, therefore, the choice of the money advice tool seems as good as any other choice. I was glad to note that the tool offers flexibility, so that it is capable of responding to individual circumstances or difficulties. That seems to be essential if such a tool is to be successful and to be the basis of calculating debt solutions that are fair and manageable for debtors.</p><p>I think that it is worth noting that, in seeking solutions that are fair and manageable for debtors, the best interests of creditors should also be served, since there is no virtue whatsoever in debt solutions that prove to be unmanageable.</p><p>I must say a word about creditors, because their interests are sometimes neglected. An important aspect of any debt solution is the need to be fair also to creditors who have provided goods or services in good faith, in the expectation that they will be paid. I do not share Jenny Marra&#8217;s view that the status quo is acceptable. The committee heard evidence that returns to creditors are something of the order of 17p in the pound. That does not seem to me to be supportive of entrepreneurship in the way that Jenny Marra described.</p><p>We heard from people who had entered into bankruptcy but who earnestly wished to pay any money that was due, for the sake of their self-esteem. Extending the repayment period to 48 months for those who are able to make repayment is, therefore, reasonable. Despite some concerns about the possibility of that leading to defaults in payment, we were not presented with any evidence to back up that concern.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22817002", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the committee clerks and advisers and all those who gave evidence to the committee and assisted us in a useful examination of the bill.

Its timing is perfect because, as Charles Dickens famously realised, the festive season is a time when we should consider those who are vulnerable or in difficulty. It is a time when the contrast between the haves and the have-nots in our society is rendered in stark terms, the engine of consumerism is at maximum revs, and already stretched budgets are under severe pressure.</p><p>It is therefore no surprise that people are driven to borrow at this time of year and it is no surprise that, when the high street banks will not offer facilities to those with slender resources, people turn to other sources of credit, or that payday lenders are ready to pounce on such unsuspecting and vulnerable borrowers. I say particularly to the Labour members whom we have heard that that is what 300 years of the union and the failure of the UK Government to regulate the payday industry have brought us to.</p><p>Thankfully, there is an alternative. Credit unions offer unsecured lending in a responsible and fair-minded way. Loan applications can be fast and can be done online, but they are always accompanied by prudent advice and there is always a system of checking to ensure that loans are affordable for borrowers. That is the essence of responsible lending, and it is by following responsible lending practices that the cost of borrowing can be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Credit unions offer far more than unsecured lending. They encourage saving and offer a variety of savings products, because saving even modest but regular amounts is perhaps the best way to help to meet expenses such as those that we are all faced with during the festive season. Saving is the best way to lay in a contingency fund to deal with the emergencies that we all face from time to time, when some ready cash is necessary. It is the way to get out of the debt cycle and ahead of the game.</p><p>In researching for the debate, I found out that some credit unions even offer mortgages. Members have referred to that. Those credit unions offer a full and comprehensive alternative to high street banks; the difference is that they are not solely motivated by chasing high and unsustainable profits. That ethos is all-important, and it ensures that a careful balance will always be struck in delivering a sympathetic and responsible service for savers and borrowers.</p><p>In conclusion, I am delighted that the Scottish Government has launched the 12 days of debtmas campaign to foster greater awareness of credit unions, which offer a much better alternative to payday loans and, in many cases, a better service than high street banks do. The more people there are who use credit unions, the more they will grow, and the more they grow, the more people can benefit from their excellent range of financial services.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22817122", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: 12 Days of Debtmas Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate John Wilson on securing the debate.

I am old enough to remember when employees got a weekly pay packet with real cash inside. In those prudent days, bills were paid weekly and the surplus was carefully nurtured. Most important, incomes at the lower end of the spectrum were much higher in real terms than they are today. Wealth and income inequality have increased markedly over the past 30 years, and the movement towards paying employees monthly in arrears helped to fuel the credit industry, which deregulation aided and abetted.</p><p>Thatcher&#8217;s economic plan depended on a credit boom that created a false sense of wellbeing. The buy now, pay tomorrow approach was heavily promoted as consumerism really kicked off, and banks expanded dramatically as they were progressively deregulated, until the inevitable credit crunch struck. The same economic plan that shut down our industries and terminally impoverished communities relied on making us addicted to credit and creating a huge expansion of financial services to fill the black hole in our economy. All our economic eggs were put into one basket.</p><p>Sadly, in such an unequal society, the recent recessionary pain is visited most on those who are least able to bear it. The Scottish Government, on a reducing budget, simply cannot mitigate all the pain in Scotland, just as it cannot regulate the banks or legislate to curb the wicked excesses of payday lenders. All that we can do is lobby the UK Government and advise consumers. I know that the minister has been actively engaging with the UK Government in an attempt to persuade it to regulate the industry.</p><p>Against that background of 30 years of increasing inequality, the Scottish Parliament does not have sufficient levers to create a fairer and more equal society in a meaningful timescale. That is the real cure for these ailments, as there will always be those who seek to prey on the poor and the vulnerable. I am glad, therefore, that the UK Government has at last indicated a commitment to regulate payday loans, although I fear that it will not go far enough. As matters stand, it appears that it will be too little, too late, as we have come to expect from Westminster.</p><p>I can only contrast that with the Scottish Government&#8217;s rapid action, earlier this year, to replace stamp duty with the land and buildings transaction tax, quickly moving to deal with long-standing concerns that Westminster had failed to deal with for many years. In a world that moves at an ever-faster pace, it is necessary for Governments to move quickly to deal with obvious problems such as payday loans. I am also glad that the Scottish Government set up and moved quickly to improve the debt arrangement scheme that Kenneth Gibson described. It has recently taken steps to allow the earlier freezing of interest on payday loans and other debts, which is providing a means for financially distressed people to get back on their feet while avoiding bankruptcy.</p><p>The evidence for robust regulation of payday loans is overwhelming. I hope that all members of this Parliament unite and send a very clear message to Westminster that that is the case.

I owe a personal debt to CADISPA&#8217;s director, Dr Geoff Fagan, who taught me a lot about the concept of capacity building&#8212;which Liam McArthur has referred to&#8212;and the wisdom of that approach.</p><p>Rather than giving grants or advising people on how to get them, CADISPA&#8217;s approach is unique, in that the focus is on building capacity within our communities to meet whatever challenges they face, now and in future. That is the route to resilience and true sustainability.</p><p>If community development trusts are to help to build a better future, they need to be well equipped with the skills to do so and, as they do so, to learn from, and in turn teach, others. That is a mechanism that multiplies the effect that any single community trust can have on its own.

It is ironic, then, that a principal complaint of many successful community organisations and development trusts is that they are often given insufficient respect or assistance by the public agencies with which they need to interact. Indeed, community organisations are often faced with barriers that are erected, I suspect, for no reason other than that their success can challenge the very authorities that failed to help them in the first place.</p><p>If we in Parliament have a genuine wish to empower local communities, we must recognise the iron-bound principle that power is neither created nor destroyed; it is merely passed from hand to hand. Empowerment of communities implies disempowerment somewhere else.</p><p>We often have debates in Parliament about the balance of power between national and local government but if we truly want to make a difference to our society, we should perhaps focus on taking power from local government and giving it more directly to local communities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22781963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Development Trusts and Community Initiatives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in the debate because it was partly my involvement as a founding member of the community development trust on my home island of Easdale that led me into politics.

I have a dream that, in future, architecture in Scotland will assume a much higher importance than it enjoys today, because architecture is the most public of arts. It touches all of us. We live with it every day of our lives, and for generations. When a fundamental necessity of life is shelter, especially in a climate such as ours, we need more architecture, and we need more great architecture.</p><p>Since the advent of devolution, Scotland&#8217;s architects have responded to a new sense of confidence in Scotland. The Doolan award, which was established in 2002, is perhaps part of that resurgence of confidence. The fact that it is the largest architectural prize in the United Kingdom perhaps reflects that new confidence and, most of all, our ambition and aspiration that we can and will build a better Scotland. The very process of imagining, then designing and then beginning to build a better future will in itself help to usher in that better future. Prizes are important. The Doolan prize, like the First Minister&#8217;s saltire prize for marine renewables, helps to set the bar of our ambition higher than it would otherwise be, and as high as it should be. I am therefore glad that the Scottish Government supports the prize.</p><p>The great thing about good architecture is that it is not just its own reward, to be admired and enjoyed at a purely aesthetic level; it pays off in so many other very real and tangible ways. It would be wrong to talk about any of the projects that have been shortlisted for this year&#8217;s prize, but perhaps some of those that have previously won or been shortlisted for the award or other awards might illustrate that point. Reiach and Hall&#8217;s Pier Arts Centre building in Stromness springs first to my mind. On my last visit, it was host to an exhibition of no less well-known an artist and painter than Lowry, uplifting the minds and spirits of Orcadians and visitors alike and helping to fill the cash registers of local businesses.</p><p>As if that was not enough for the small town of Stromness, Malcolm Fraser is currently building the new library there, which is helping to revitalise and regenerate a town with an historic past and a great future.</p><p>Orcadians are greedy for good architecture. They get it. Orkney Islands Council gets it. Orcadians know that over its lifespan quality architecture will pay for itself many times over.</p><p>I cannot mention Orkney without mentioning Shetland. At Grodians I came across what is quite simply the best social housing development that I have ever seen&#8212;the only one that has ever made me think, &#8220;I would love to live there.&#8221; Hjaltland Housing Association and Richard Gibson Architects are due great credit for the project, which will pay for itself through better social and health outcomes and less crime, and by enabling people to live more fulfilling and rewarding lives.</p><p>If time permitted I could talk at length about many other good architectural projects that we have seen over the past decade or so, but there are other points that I want to make. We are beginning to talk a lot more about whole-life costs, because what is important is not a building&#8217;s initial cost but the cost of ownership per annum. It can be amply demonstrated that good-quality architecture costs less per annum than buildings that are commissioned and built with low initial costs in mind. We rob ourselves when we follow the cheap route towards apparent value.</p><p>What is less often talked about is the huge added value that good architecture delivers and which is not included in standard accounting. I am talking about the effects on health and happiness and everything in between, all of which has a huge value and whose absence is something for which we pay highly. I hope that some economist of talent will take up the cause and do an analytical study of the real value of good architecture. I think that many of us know intuitively that the added value that I am talking about is significant and indisputable.</p><p>My previous career as a builder was intensely practical, but I am also an unashamed and unrepentant dreamer. The final part of my dream is that we build our better Scotland in our unique Scottish way and establish a new vernacular, as a response to the 21st century&#8217;s problems, challenges and opportunities, which reflects our climate, our culture and our values and which learns international lessons without being dominated or overwhelmed by them.

Nowadays, sawn logs are exported with little or no added value, and an industry that was once labour intensive and which supported whole communities is now one in which most of the work is done by machines. Not so many years ago, there were several small sawmills in Argyll, creating employment and adding the significant value that is available when timber is converted. Now, there is none. Those sawmills went out of business not because there was no demand for their products but because they were unable to make the significant investments that were necessary for them to keep up to date and remain competitive.</p><p>Timber technology has been driven by advances that have been made in the Scandinavian countries, where significant investments have been made in small-scale sawmills, thus making an important socioeconomic contribution to their rural economies. One result of our failure to do that came to light when the new community hall was being built on the island of Colonsay a few years ago. The community was unable to source the laminated roof timbers in Scotland and had to import them from Norway. Engineered timber is a very useful material with better strength to weight ratios than steel. It is also one of our most sustainable building materials, locking up carbon for its lifespan&#8212;and, with good design and reasonable maintenance, that lifespan can be considerable. Our forefathers understood that. I have personally repaired sash and case windows that were over 100 years old and which will, I hope, last for another 100 years.</p><p>Woodlots are therefore important not only because they offer opportunities for better management of this valuable resource, creating better-quality and higher-amenity woodlands, but because they offer a means of adding significant local value to the resources, giving rise to meaningful and rewarding employment and supporting fragile rural economies. Too often in the past, our forestry has been driven by tax advantages manifesting themselves in fast-growing spruce plantations. Mixed and less dense planting, especially of native hardwoods, offers a much higher albeit longer-term return not just in economic terms but in terms of biodiversity and landscape quality. In well-managed woodlands, timber can be a source not just of firewood or sawn logs for pulp but of a high-quality material for building as well as a source material for crafts such as furniture making.</p><p>Woodlots offer an opportunity for the kind of good management that has been noticeably absent from much of our forest land in recent years.

It has reinforced my belief that carbon capture and storage is yet another exciting opportunity for Scotland, in which we can once again be at the cutting edge of a new technology: leading the world in solving the climate challenge, decarbonising our energy supply, providing energy security, keeping down energy prices and providing new high-quality and rewarding careers. It is difficult not to like carbon capture and storage; not to be enthusiastic about it; and not to see the immense opportunity that it represents for Scotland.</p><p>I am reminded once again of that great English economist, David Ricardo, and his theory of competitive advantage. There is no doubt that CCS is yet another area in which Scotland has an obvious competitive advantage. Our depleted oil and gas fields offer the perfect opportunity for sequestrating CO2&#8212;the geological conditions are right, and we have the technological skills and capacity to make it happen and the academic knowledge base to ensure that it is done well and safely. The risk of leakage is non-existent, and the pipelines are in place, so it is merely a matter of using existing technology and skills in a new way.</p><p>That is not to say that there are not some challenges to overcome, but I have no doubt that Scotland&#8217;s engineers and academics can rise to those exciting challenges. It is important that we demonstrate carbon capture and storage in commercial operation as soon as we can reasonably do so. The main challenge is for us as politicians to recognise the significant opportunity that CCS offers and to put aside any small differences and work together to make it happen.</p><p>I am keen to see the results of the UK Government&#8217;s competition, and keen for the Peterhead project to be given the green light. I am also keen to see the competition widened if possible to include more than two preferred bidders, and I believe that the captain clean energy project would be the perfect candidate. If that is not possible, I would like to see some form of contracts for difference incentive for carbon capture and storage projects as part of the energy market reform that is going through the UK Parliament. Good government is about good economic stewardship and maximising our economic opportunities and competitive advantages. It is not about letting the grass grow under our feet and seeing other countries take advantage of those opportunities.</p><p>There is a wider point. It is about pioneering those technologies where it makes sense for us to do so, not just for Scotland&#8217;s economic advantage but to play our part as a responsible nation that is helping to solve the global problem of climate change by leading the way and showing other countries how to do it.</p><p>As Joan McAlpine has just said, China is building a new coal-fired power station every week. Perhaps Mr Harvie should reflect on that. The captain clean energy project offers a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the world how coal gasification works. Noxious chemicals and carbon are removed both before and after combustion. Coal is responsible for the largest proportion of worldwide CO2 emissions, and the technology paves the way for removing 90 per cent of CO2&#8212;and perhaps more than that&#8212;from our energy production.

Fuel poverty is running at an unacceptable level of more than 20 per cent across the UK but at the much higher level of 30 per cent across Scotland. As Liam McArthur indicated, in Scotland&#8217;s islands fuel poverty is at the truly shocking level of 50 per cent. I will leave members to decide for themselves whether that represents a union dividend or a union deficit.</p><p>As members will know, most powers relating to energy are reserved to Westminster. Therefore, fuel poverty is largely a failure not of the Scottish Government but of Westminster&#8217;s policy. That is not to suggest that the Scottish Government can do nothing or is doing nothing about fuel poverty, but it is important to place the matter in its proper context.</p><p>For that reason, I was glad to hear Ed Miliband suggest that if his party is elected to government, he hopes to do something to tackle fuel poverty. I am glad that he recognises the problem of fuel poverty, even if I am concerned that his proposed method may not work and may have unintended consequences. Price controls are a blunt and unwieldy instrument that may do more harm than good. The proposal seems to carry more than a whiff of populism and political opportunism.</p><p>I prefer the more careful method that the Scottish Government has followed in setting up an expert commission and listening carefully to what that commission says. I also prefer the Scottish Government&#8217;s approach of providing help to insulate homes, because that will provide long-term energy savings and long-term cost savings.</p><p>There may be other policy solutions. If we had full control over energy policy, we would have the opportunity, for example, to introduce progressive fuel charging, to offer discounted rates for prepayment meters or to offer a lower wind tariff or island tariff, as is currently being discussed for Orkney and Shetland. We could use the renewable energy power that is currently constrained by the lack of grid infrastructure. I look forward to hearing suggestions from the expert commission on energy.</p><p>The technical challenges, too, must be overcome. For example, the standard assessment procedure that is used throughout the UK to measure home energy efficiency is flawed. As Liam McArthur mentioned, the methodology has given rise to what has become known as &#8220;eco-bling&#8221;&#8212;technologies of dubious benefit that are appended to buildings only to comply with the SAP calculation.</p><p>Until we have a better understanding of how we can deal with the technological challenges, it might be a mistake to throw money at the problem. We are still learning how to deal with the profound difficulties presented by our older housing stock. Some housing associations are concerned that some of the work done to meet current standards will need to be redone to meet forthcoming standards.</p><p>At a time when there are severe challenges to our financial resources, we need to ensure that every penny is spent wisely. Much of the low-hanging fruit has already been picked, as we have insulated about 60 per cent of accessible loft spaces and about 60 per cent of cavity walls. In these difficult times, unfortunately, there are no silver bullets when it comes to dealing with fuel poverty. In the long run, a careful approach that closely examines and learns from the effectiveness of policy and technical measures will deliver the solutions.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy Action Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Fuel poverty is a measure that captures many related problems, including low incomes, poor insulation, high fuel prices and, in the Highlands and Islands, the associated fuel transport costs.

In many of our most isolated and remote communities, farming is still the only mainstay of the economy.</p><p>Farming is important not just for economic reasons; in many ways, it has defined and shaped rural life and it is deeply embedded in our culture. Most importantly, our farmers have been the custodians of our landscape for thousands of years. They have shaped and maintained it for all of us to enjoy.</p><p>We have recently debated wild land in the Parliament. Interestingly, a few months ago, I asked Andrew Thin of Scottish Natural Heritage to tell me where the wild land is. Despite knowing the Highlands and Islands well, I am unaware of any land that has not been worked over in some way by the hand of man in the past 10,000 years or so. His reply suggested that what I suspected was correct: there is no wild land in Scotland. The vast majority of our land is fully tamed and in the care of our farmers.</p><p>I know a few isolated and desolate spots that are uncared for. They are inhospitable and desperate places of impenetrable undergrowth or impassable bogs that are virtually impossible to traverse. Anyone who knows much about our history will understand that we do not have to go far back to find a time when much more of our countryside was like that.</p><p>It is thanks only to our farmers that it has been tamed into something that now looks good on postcards and offers opportunities for recreation. Anyone who has doubts about that has only to consider the rampant and unfettered growth of trees and undergrowth along many of our rural roadsides that has sprung up in recent years. Across much of the Highlands, many of our best views and vistas are screened by this untrammelled growth, which is, ironically, much worse when tourists are about in summer and the undergrowth is in leaf. I see Mr McGrigor nodding; he knows exactly what I mean.</p><p>The one scenic railway journey from Glasgow to Oban predominantly offers views of the rampant growth of willows and birch. As sheep numbers decline, we have seen in some areas an explosion of bracken, which is a noxious weed that cannot be controlled unless there is an economic reason for doing so. That is what happens when land is not cared for, and it is part of what is threatened if our farmers are not supported.</p><p>The difficulty that our farming industry has faced in recent years is perhaps most accurately expressed by the high levels of suicide among our farmers. Few rural communities have not been touched by the dreadful spectre of suicide and all that it entails. There is no doubt that we need to support our farmers, and there is no doubt that farmers in Scotland face many challenges undreamt of by the UK Government that purports to represent them.</p><p>Thanks to the remarkable energy of the cabinet secretary, our farmers at least have a partial voice in Europe. Thanks to our cabinet secretary, we now have a very successful food and drink strategy that significantly adds value to our farmers&#8217; produce and to our rural economies. Thanks to our cabinet secretary, we now know that Scotland&#8217;s farmers would be much better off if we were independent within Europe, with subsidies between 2015 and 2020 worth more than &#8364;1 billion more than if we continue as part of the UK. The supporting arithmetic for that calculation is straightforward and compelling.</p><p>We in Scotland understand our farming industry and what it requires to make it thrive so that our farmers can continue to play their part as the backbone of our rural economies and the custodians of our landscapes. That accords well with that self-evident principle that decisions are best taken by those who understand them and are closest to them, and that all decisions about Scotland are best taken here in this Parliament with proper representation in Europe and the full powers of independence.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698453", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in the debate, as farming remains a crucial part of the economy of the Highlands and Islands.

A payback that achieves more than &#163;5 of benefit for every public pound that is spent is a worthy achievement in any climate and, in the economic climate of recent years, it is remarkable.</p><p>The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee has had the opportunity to question senior officials from the enterprise agencies on several occasions over the past two years, and I know from those sessions that the evidence of the effectiveness of our enterprise agencies can stand up to scrutiny. I pay particular tribute to the robust methodology that Scottish Enterprise has developed to analyse its effectiveness. It takes a courageous and confident organisation to subject itself to such robust self-analysis, and I am convinced that that is part of the key to its success in recent years.</p><p>The clear goals and direction that the Scottish Government has set are another part of the reason for the success of our enterprise agencies.

Employment is higher, unemployment is lower, growth is returning faster than it is to the UK as a whole and, over the long term, Scotland is performing extremely well indeed.</p><p>Just as the Scottish Government is following a course of economic wisdom, sadly, George Osborne is ignoring the wisdom of perhaps England&#8217;s greatest economist, John Maynard Keynes, and we are all paying for the chancellor&#8217;s economic ineptitude.

Often, significant engineering and construction challenges have to be overcome, which arise out of difficult terrain. Each project presents significantly differing challenges because of differing topographies and geology as well as the problems that are associated with construction access.</p><p>Hydro projects are therefore necessarily capital intensive and, because each project is a one-off, hydro power presents less opportunity for costs to fall as the technology matures. I am glad that the Scottish Government recognises that in its continuing support regime for larger hydro projects, maintained at 1 ROC per MWh. I understand the concerns that developers of smaller projects have about feed-in tariff degression and especially about the clumsy way in which it is being implemented. I am grateful to Ken Macintosh for addressing that in detail.</p><p>Technical challenges are the challenges on which our civil engineers thrive. Such challenges can be stimulating; they can foster innovation and the sense of accomplishment that goes along with overcoming technical difficulties.</p><p>Less uplifting and quite dispiriting are the challenges of grid constraint and grid connection costs. Members will know that solving those problems depends on the United Kingdom Government getting its act together on energy policy. It is time for it to listen to the industry and to implement quickly the necessary grid infrastructure, active grid management solutions such as those in Orkney and a support regime that facilitates the development of renewables. In doing so, the UK Government should consider support for energy storage schemes, especially as pumped-hydro projects offer a well understood method for the large-scale storage that is required to balance the grid.</p><p>There are further problems with the regulatory regime, which seems to delight at times in delaying projects. There was a time when I had no antipathy towards the supposedly rare bryophyte species Hamatocaulis vernicosus. However, now that I know that that plant is an enemy of hydro power masquerading as an endangered species, when it is no such thing as endangered, I think less well of it and some of its cousins. It is aided and abetted in its subterfuge by Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, which should know better and which often simply fail to do their homework.</p><p>There is a further lesson: we will not safeguard our environment with bad science and bad biology, nor through the lazy application of the scheme in which SEPA applies a much more prohibitive and onerous regime to small-scale hydro projects of less than 100kW, which amounts to an effective presumption against such schemes. The regulatory burden often falls most heavily on the shoulders of small business and on community projects, yet such small-scale schemes offer significant opportunities for local socioeconomic improvements, often in areas that badly need them.</p><p>Many communities across the Highlands and Islands have been dying slowly for decades. Those communities deserve our due consideration in the hierarchy of concerns, at the top of which has to be the survival and wellbeing of our own species.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693928", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hydro Power"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to Mr Fraser for introducing a note of humour into the debate.

The acolytes of both Thatcher and Blair believe that to be an economic virtue, but such thinking merely underpins the short-termism of the casino economy. When employment is uncertain, people spend less and demand falls. Given that a large part of the reason for our current economic underperformance is the lack of demand, a flexible labour market can be regarded only as another of the UK Government&#8217;s economic vices. Chief among those vices is, of course, the austerity agenda. Recent warnings from the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, as well as a very long list of economists, are going seemingly unheeded by the coalition.</p><p>The effect is compounded by UK employment law, which underpins so-called labour market flexibility, giving rise to the zero-hours contracts that we have heard about as well as sometimes bogus self-employment for people who, in reality, ought to be employees. As if that were not bad enough, on-going welfare reform is giving rise to yet more uncertainty and is lowering demand still further. Economic success cannot be built on the back of the working poor.</p><p>Against that background, the results that the Scottish Government has achieved are remarkable, with recent figures for growth and employment showing that Scotland is outperforming the UK. The strategy that is being pursued, of capitalising on our areas of competitive advantage and our natural assets, is proving the Scottish Government&#8217;s economic wisdom. A disaggregation of growth data shows that oil and gas, renewable energy, life sciences and food and drink, among others, are the sectors that are driving our economic recovery and forging an economy that is balanced and, therefore, resilient. Such dynamic and growing sectors offer the opportunity of high-quality employment.</p><p>Aligning education, skills and training with genuine employment and career opportunities is an important part of the continuing work to curb both unemployment and underemployment. That is why initiatives such as the Nigg Skills Academy are so important, where Government is working directly with industry in a joint approach to education and training in areas that offer real opportunity.</p><p>In the face of the economic illiteracy of the UK coalition, the Scottish Government can do only so much to combat the twin scourges of unemployment and underemployment. The committee fairly acknowledges that in its report. What is missing is the third factor in the equation, which is tax-raising powers. The enhanced taxation revenue resulting from economic growth would allow the effect of good government and good economics to be reinforced and rewarded, allowing yet more investment in what would become a virtuous circle of success.

That is sad on a number of levels. We all know the stories of how the Caledonian forest was cut down and cleared, to make way for sheep and for other reasons. In Argyll, the wood was burned for charcoal for 100 years. Our Argyll woodlands supplied the cannonballs for Nelson&#8217;s navy. It is interesting that the woodland that was adjacent to the Bonawe ironworks was not just harvested but well managed and conserved, but outwith the immediate vicinity of the works, the forest was felled with no thought for conservation. The woodlands were destroyed over a huge area and are gone.</p><p>In the place of the old Caledonian forest, we have spruce plantations, from which timber is exported for a few pounds a tonne. There is no local added value and, these days, there are few jobs. Man has been replaced by machine, and our local sawmills, unable to invest in new technology, are gone too.

It was a great pity that I did not see any Opposition members there&#8212;had they been there, their eyebrows would have risen as high as those of the rest of the audience, which was a veritable &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who&#8221; of the energy sector in Scotland.</p><p>Mr Buchanan gave a stark warning. Due to the uncertainties of energy market reform, there is a real risk of the lights going out in England, as reserve capacity there has declined to just 4 per cent. I raised the same concern earlier this week in the chamber, which Tory and Lib Dem members, in particular, seemed to find very funny. I find that a strange attitude, as it is not a prospect that I would wish for any of our friends and neighbours in England.</p><p>Mr Buchanan outlined how many of the assumptions that had been made about importing energy from France, Ireland, Russia and elsewhere were fraught with difficulties, not least because many of our European neighbours are also energy importers on a significant scale. Assumptions about importing energy from those countries may prove not to be at all realistic. In the question session afterwards, which involved a very knowledgeable expert audience, no one questioned the real and credible concerns that had been explained&#8212;everyone there agreed that the delay and uncertainty caused by prevarication over EMR are damaging and are making a bad situation worse.</p><p>Part of the problem, no doubt, is the remarkable turnover of UK energy ministers and the disillusionment that is setting in at DECC, with several high-ranking and very experienced personnel having left recently. That is why I am glad that the Scottish Government is taking such a helpful and reasonable attitude. Good evidence for that constructive co-operation is given in the newly published document &#8220;Scottish Islands Renewable Project: Final Report&#8221;, which was prepared on behalf of both Scottish and UK Governments. I commend that excellent report to members. It makes the case quite decisively for the enormous renewable energy potential of Scotland&#8217;s islands.</p><p>The minister correctly said that the report suggests that Scotland&#8217;s islands could produce 5 per cent of the electricity that the UK needs by 2030. The report also says that, ultimately, Scotland&#8217;s islands could produce as much as 20 per cent of the electricity that the UK demands and that Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles would benefit from a significant number of jobs. The report suggests that 10,000 jobs could be created on those islands by 2030, with a further 29,000 full-time equivalent jobs being created throughout the rest of the UK. The report outlines how energy generation on the islands can be competitive, with the higher costs of generation on islands mitigated by significantly higher capacity. However, it stresses that generation projects will be viable only if a fair and reasonable connection and transmission charging regime is provided, and it outlines a number of sensible ways in which that can be done.</p><p>The whole point of energy market reform is to keep the lights on at an affordable cost while decarbonising our energy supply.

It reduces the incentives of work and fosters the belief that normal aspirations are outwith the reach of many people, thereby reinforcing the cultural belief that celebrity and perhaps the lottery offer the only realistic routes out of poverty and undermining the belief that the steady application of effort in a career is worth it. A culture that seems to suggest that some careers are glamorous and exciting and others are drab and unrewarding is not helpful. Unhappily, our education system has sometimes reinforced that view by offering educational courses that are not as well aligned to job and career opportunities as they could be.</p><p>In its recent inquiry into underemployment, the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee heard from UK Oil and Gas that it currently faces significant skills shortages and that it anticipates a demand for around 100,000 young people over the coming years.

That indicates the importance of the Scottish Government&#8217;s collaboration with industry in initiatives such as the Nigg Skills Academy, which aims to train at least 3,000 younger folk in energy industry skills by 2015. Not only is it immoral that young people are consigned to unemployment when some industries are crying out for new recruits, it is economically inefficient and will stifle those same industries, which offer the greatest prospects for growth. That indicates also the importance of modern apprenticeships, which re-establish the link between training and employment in areas where real career opportunities lie.

Some of our colleagues&#8212;none of those who are in the chamber&#8212;have suggested that it is a somewhat technical and dry subject. On the contrary, it is interesting and profound.</p><p>I congratulate the Finance Committee on producing an excellent report. It is concise and readable but covers all the important points. Most importantly, it is accessible to someone who, like me, did not sit through all the committee&#8217;s deliberations.</p><p>Although I welcome further powers coming to the Parliament, I am not a huge fan of the Scotland Act 2012, largely because it was a missed opportunity to do much more. However, the important point is that the Scottish Government and the Parliament have seized the opportunity to address the long-standing neglect of the problems presented by stamp duty&#8212;something that the Westminster Parliament failed to do.</p><p>That indicates to me the profound difference between the two Parliaments. One is old and slow moving; ours is agile and able and can quickly respond to new opportunities. That is one of its many understated assets.</p><p>However, speed is not everything. That brings me back to the bill and the committee&#8217;s report, in which it is obvious that quality has not been sacrificed in the process of scrutiny.</p><p>A further point that strikes me is how positively the prospect of change has been embraced by those involved in the property sector. All the responses to the committee seem to be positive. Even almost, but not quite, all the responses in the chamber seem to be positive. There is a tangible sense of relish, excitement and positive possibility in the responses that augurs well for the future of Scotland and suggests a widespread appetite for many more powers to come to the Parliament.</p><p>I suggest that members should contemplate the power of that effect writ large throughout Scotland as we collectively address the opportunities of independence. I suggest that that effect will bring a boost to the commonweal and our economy. It will bring what we might call an independence bounce.</p><p>The approach to the bill signifies a further profound difference between this Parliament and Westminster as we take the opportunity to make the tax fairer and simpler while, at the same time, taking care to avoid distorting the market or having a perverse and detrimental economic effect. That is the essence of good policy, as is amply demonstrated in the approach to the bill, which has the principles of social justice and progressive taxation at its heart.</p><p>That is a fairly profound point, I think, which was missed by some of the people who made representations to the committee. Progressive taxation arrangements that are fair and simple limit the desire and opportunity for tax avoidance. If we overburden the bill with complexity, we will increase the likelihood of unintended consequences and we might generate opportunities for creative and unprincipled avoidance schemes.</p><p>Some points about the bill were well made. For example, I sympathise with people who are concerned about sub-sale relief, in some instances, particularly at a time when banks are reluctant to finance property development. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s commitment to consider relief in respect of forward-funding schemes. I also sympathise with people who seek to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock. They are perfectly correct to do so. However, the bill is not the vehicle through which to achieve that aim.</p><p>My main concern is the OBR&#8217;s unbridled optimism in its forecasts on stamp duty receipts over the next six years, which I contrast with its supreme and widely discredited pessimism about oil receipts over a similar period. Either the OBR is on another planet or it is merely the political puppet of the Westminster coalition, which is no doubt taking a hollow negotiating position as it seeks to reduce the block grant beyond what is reasonable. I have every faith that common sense will prevail and that such posturing will soon be punctured.</p><p>I am glad to welcome the opportunities that the bill presents and I commend the approach of the Scottish Government and of the Finance Committee.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although I am not a member of the Finance Committee, I relish the opportunity of speaking in this important debate.

I am glad to have the opportunity to share some of my thoughts, which spring from more than 30 years&#8217; experience of running a small business in the construction sector.</p><p>I remember receiving about 25 years ago the renewal documents for a contract for services that my company then provided to Argyll and Bute District Council. The original contract was three pages long; the renewal documentation five years later was the size of a thick telephone directory, and three copies had to be signed and witnessed. The contract was worth less than &#163;5,000 per annum.</p><p>I was reluctant&#8212;my lawyer friends would approve of this&#8212;to sign the document without first reading and fully understanding it. Three pages into the document, I realised that I would need to engage the services of a whole team of lawyers for at least a month before I could safely sign it.</p><p>In the end, I solved the problem by the simple expedient of not signing the contract. That seemed like a good solution. We continued to provide the service and get paid for the next 15 years, despite three further tendering exercises and three sets of unsigned contract documents over that period. Nobody ever noticed that we did not sign the contract.</p><p>That example epitomises much of what is still wrong with Scotland&#8217;s public sector procurement, which is often overly bureaucratic in a way that is disproportionate to the contract size. I am happy to acknowledge that we have made much progress in Scotland and that our record compares well with the rest of the UK and with many countries in Europe. However, it is absolutely right that we should strive for continual improvement, and there is no question but that improvement is required.</p><p>Much of the problem seems to stem from risk aversion. I know of two fairly recent significant projects in the Highlands and Islands where the main contractor went into liquidation shortly after beginning the work. In each case, the subcontractors and the supply chain of smaller local firms were significantly out of pocket. In each case, the contracts cost much more to complete. We need the procurement process to be much less risk averse and much more risk aware. We also need a process that properly manages risk&#8212;all the risks.</p><p>One good way of managing risk is the unbundling or disaggregation of larger contracts. That not only spreads the risk but gives smaller local companies a better chance of winning contracts. Smaller contracts are often less attractive to predatory firms, which may be very good at dealing with the bureaucracy but much less good at actually carrying out the work.</p><p>By helping smaller businesses, smaller contracts help Scotland to achieve what the economists refer to as churn&#8212;the process by which the big, fat, lazy cats are replaced by lean, mean, hungry cats. That is also the process that drives innovation. Both of those are necessary ingredients in any successful economy.</p><p>Rural areas such as the Highlands and Islands present particular challenges for project delivery, particularly in the islands. Almost always, the smaller local firms are best at negotiating and dealing with those challenges. For aftercare and warranty work, I have often found that firms from far afield are&#8212;understandably&#8212;reluctant to send operatives out to far-flung places.</p><p>We need to focus much more on outcomes and the quality of outcomes and far less on process. That is especially the case in tendering architectural work, because even our most successful architects tend to work in small companies. If we cannot capture quality at the design stage of a project, we will not achieve it further on in the delivery process.</p><p>The great thing about a small country such as Scotland is that we can drive forward the process of reform and continual improvement faster than larger countries can. The Parliament has already delivered procurement processes better than many other countries&#8212;think what we could do with all the levers of innovation and reform at our disposal.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688659", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Procurement Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I commend the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee on securing the debate.

The vast majority of the housing stock&#8212;more than 90 per cent&#8212;is more than 10 years old and such homes are not nearly as energy efficient as new houses are. To raise energy efficiency standards for new homes beyond what is planned would be to run the risk of building far fewer new homes, which would be counterproductive, even in the context of our climate change targets.</p><p>It was suggested that tough regulations should be introduced for the private rented sector. The suggestion fails to recognise that even with today&#8217;s high energy prices, many interventions have a payback period of more than 60 years. That is made clear in the Sullivan report, which I commend to members who have not read it. The green deal also fails to recognise that issue.

Whereas the Scottish Government is focused on renewable energy and its climate change targets and recognises that the approach offers many opportunities as well as challenges, the UK Government is unfocused and perhaps confused. It is procrastinating on energy market reform and the necessary grid enhancements, it is procrastinating on transmission charges, especially for Scotland&#8217;s islands, and it is procrastinating on the domestic renewable heat incentive, all of which could help Scotland to achieve its climate change targets sooner rather than later.</p><p>I would think better of some Opposition members of this Parliament if they thought less about applying unwise and punitive regulation to Scotland&#8217;s people and businesses and more about the inadequacies of the UK Parliament, and if they gave a little thought to the issue and recognised how well the Scottish Government is doing in achieving its very ambitious climate change targets.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I reject that suggestion absolutely, Ms Grant.

Those figures, which are up from last year&#8217;s figures, clearly show that Scotland is on a successful trajectory.</p><p>Scotland has been in a better fiscal position than the rest of the UK for five years. We are now producing 9.9 per cent of the UK&#8217;s revenue, which is up from 9.6 per cent in the previous year. That indicates significant fiscal strength, especially as we have only 8.4 per cent of the UK&#8217;s population. It is unfortunate that we receive only 9.3 per cent of the expenditure. In other words, we pay more to Westminster than we get back, and we have done so for some time. The figures also reveal that Scotland is in a better position than the UK to the tune of &#163;4.4 billion, or &#163;834 per person.</p><p>I am sure that the Opposition parties will be glad to hear that the good news story for Scotland does not stop there. Scotland&#8217;s oil and gas industry is entering a new phase of increased production, with investment this year expected to reach &#163;13 billion and plans for longer-term investment exceeding &#163;100 billion.</p><p>I think that the Opposition parties think that those oil companies and their investors are completely stupid, but it is no surprise that they expect the fields to be more, not less, productive over the coming years and that revenue is expected to be between &#163;41 billion and &#163;57 billion over the next six years. That will give a newly independent Scotland a great start. It is a financial springboard that will propel us on to even greater success.</p><p>That is not all the good news. As the First Minister has said, Scotland has won the energy lottery not once, but twice: it has 25 per cent of Europe&#8217;s wind and tidal resources and 10 per cent of its wave energy potential. This will play an ever more significant part in Scotland&#8217;s economy. Scotland has an oil resource that will last for another 40 or so years, with 24 billion barrels still to be extracted, which will be worth more than &#163;1.5 trillion at today's prices. No serious commentator is suggesting that oil prices are going to fall in the long term. However, the important point is that our offshore marine energy industry will be maturing as oil begins to run out.</p><p>The Offshore Valuation Group suggested in its 2010 report that by 2050 marine energy may contribute as much as &#163;4 billion per annum to Scottish revenue in corporation tax alone. That excludes onshore renewables, the myriad of opportunities afforded by micro energy and the onshore supply chain, and the considerable economic potential of exporting our expertise in that most valuable sector, the knowledge economy.</p><p>The unionist parties are pessimists and doubters. Anyone who doubts that Scotland will succeed in harnessing nature or that it can solve the technical problems associated with marine energy should go to the European Marine Energy Centre on Orkney. They should experience for themselves the creative energy being brought to bear all over Orkney, not just in the offices and test stations but in conversations in pubs, fish and chip shops and cafes. They should go to Orkney and experience the renaissance effect that is under way as those creative people apply their talents to solving the problems and exploiting the exciting opportunities.</p><p>That is exactly what the economist David Ricardo meant by countries exploiting their comparative advantages. It is what Joe Stiglitz means when he prescribes moving to a green economy as the medicine for ailing economies. Unlike the UK Government, which is prevaricating over energy policy, an independent Scotland will nurture this opportunity. We will continue to lead the way in the renewable energy revolution and we will reap the economic and fiscal rewards.</p><p>There is a point when the Unionists, the doubters and the doomsayers turn to dishonesty in their efforts to diminish Scotland. They crossed this line before when they buried the McCrone report and for 30-odd years told us the lie that Scotland&#8217;s oil was of little value.

A stronger word is needed, at least for me. What I mean by wild is the wildness that we experience going through the Corryvreckan whirlpool in a small fishing boat in a gale or walking over the mountains of Mull in a snowstorm in winter, not for fun but out of necessity, and sometimes out of grim necessity.</p><p>I am led to believe that the definition of wild land is</p><p>&#8220;an area where an individual finds the experience of wildness is particularly strong.&#8221;</p><p>I find that that sometimes applies to Edinburgh. According to that definition, there is not much of Scotland that I, and the people who work on the land in our remote rural areas, would describe as wild.</p><p>I have a love of our natural environment and all its inhabitants. I am fortunate to be able to enjoy that right on my doorstep. Dolphins often play around the ferryboat that serves my island home. I can climb into my kayak and, in less than an hour, watch sea eagles on Mull or golden eagles on the Garvellachs. I have scratched the backs of basking sharks on lazy summer seas and rowed madly away from killer whales when their distinctive dorsal fins have appeared too close for comfort. I have come face to face with wild Mull goats, looked into their eyes and understood why the devil was sometimes personified as a big billy goat with horns and a beard. I am really not being funny here. I have watched otters play and nursed young seals back to health.</p><p>However, my chief concern is that it is our own species, Homo sapiens, that is the threatened species throughout much of the Highlands and Islands. Mankind has inhabited Scotland for around 10,000 years, perhaps more. In that time, we have disposed of the Caledonian forest that once covered our country. In Argyll, we did it to make cannonballs for Nelson&#8217;s navy. Almost all our land has been grazed or burned, and the landscape has no resemblance to what it was even a few hundred years ago. A handful of people make a meagre living from it. It supports fewer people every year. Traditional rural economies are declining. Many people cling to their livelihoods like limpets on wave-washed rocks.</p><p>Rural economies are changing, as they must do, to survive. New opportunities are opening up, which almost always involves some new development. Many of our most economically and socially fragile areas are already suffering death by designation. Living and life itself are sometimes banned in those areas, yet those people who live on our land, as opposed to those who go there only to play, have been the custodians of that land for generations. They have a deep-rooted understanding of the land and how to nurture it. That landscape quality takes work and active management. Under the care of people who understand that, our landscapes have been maintained in an almost pristine condition&#8212;a pristine condition that leads others to conclude that it is wild. Successful conservation is a bottom-up and not a top-down process, and cannot and should not be imposed by designation.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685812", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Conservation (Endangered Species and Wild Land)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am particularly pleased to speak in the debate because I have spent all of my adult life and much of my childhood living and working close to some of Scotland&#8217;s wildest places.

Demographic change is one of the big themes and challenges of our time. In so far as it is a challenge, there is an element of irony, in that as a society we have in part become a victim of our own success. As members have said, the very welcome fact is that, generally speaking, we live much longer than we used to. However, that does not detract from the fact that that is not the case in areas of our country that suffer from deprivation, where lifespans have not increased and deprivation on its own presents significant challenges.</p><p>There is no doubt, though, that our ageing population presents profound challenges for service delivery and how we finance it. The challenges will intensify as the baby boom generation progressively retires and costs are borne by a relatively smaller workforce. There is a particular challenge for the Highlands and Islands, where demographic changes are intensified because, in many areas, we export younger people and import old people. Rurality presents particular service delivery challenges, not least for healthcare. I welcome some of the information technology innovations that might help to deal with that by reducing costs and by maintaining or improving the quality of services.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant response to the challenge, which is not really touched on or fully articulated in the Finance Committee report, is to ensure a successful and growing economy. The Scottish Government is pursuing that with vigour and is concentrating on areas of our economy where we have a comparative advantage, including oil and gas, renewable energy, life sciences and food, to name just a few sectors. However, in seeking a successful economy, the concern is by no means just the pursuit of growth for its own sake. Instead, as is made plain from the implementation of the national performance framework, the aim is sustainable growth and a fully functioning and balanced economy that measures success across a broad socioeconomic spectrum.</p><p>I was therefore delighted to hear the Nobel prize-winning economist Professor Stiglitz pay tribute to that approach in giving evidence to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee only last week, when he said:</p><p>&#8220;Let me commend Scotland for the several efforts that are being made to develop better measures of performance.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 27 February 2013; c 2594.]</p><p>That tribute is all the more apt considering Professor Stiglitz&#8217;s latest book, &#8220;The Price of Inequality&#8221;, since inequality is in itself a contributory factor to the challenge that is presented by demographic change. Fuel poverty is one example of the difficulties that are disproportionately borne by older people.</p><p>Economic success is insufficient to tackle the problem. I believe that credit is due to the Government for maintaining a range of universal services and for implementing a range of preventative spend measures. Free personal care is one such provision and I am delighted that spending has increased from &#163;133&#160;million in 2003-04 to &#163;342&#160;million in 2010-11. That is not only wise, but financially prudent, as indicated by Age UK, which estimates that it costs &#163;5,000 a year to provide personal care for someone, compared with &#163;25,000 per annum for a person to be looked after in a care home.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685474", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Demographic change and an ageing population&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I compliment the Finance Committee on its inquiry and report on this important subject.

I also commend our team of clerks and advisers for their patience and professionalism and I thank the many witnesses who gave evidence.</p><p>The result is a comprehensive and valuable report on a subject that is of the utmost importance to Scotland. The issue is big and complex, and our inquiry was necessarily long. In such a fast-moving field, much has happened since we finished taking evidence. I am pleased that most of that has been positive.</p><p>I particularly welcome the First Minister&#8217;s announcement of an even more challenging, but achievable, interim target of generating 50 per cent of our electricity from renewables by 2015. Political will is the vital ingredient in assuring our success in achieving such targets and&#8212;fortunately&#8212;we have that in abundance.</p><p>Renewable energy is important not only because we enjoy significant opportunities and economic advantages from such technologies but because, of all the commodities in the modern world, energy is the king. With sufficient low-cost energy, we can solve all our other problems. That, along with our oil and gas reserves, gives Scotland a huge comparative advantage that makes it difficult to see how we are not set for a future of long-term and sustainable economic success.</p><p>Of course, there are challenges in achieving the targets&#8212;if there were not, that would mean that we had not set the targets high enough. However, the committee painstakingly explored those challenges, and the overwhelming conclusion was that they are surmountable and that we are on course to achieve the targets.</p><p>Just as there are challenges, so are there many opportunities for jobs and growth, as well as for local social benefits, including the means in many areas to tackle the scourge of fuel poverty. It is an absolute disgrace that energy-rich Scotland should suffer fuel poverty to the extent that it does.</p><p>I am glad to note that, since the report was published, the difficulties that we indicated with the planning system have been at least partially dealt with. The planning minister recently announced a 20 per cent increase in fees and provided a fund, to which colleagues have referred, of &#163;673,000 to help to deal with wind turbine applications.</p><p>I am glad that the committee successfully exploded some of the myths that surround renewable energy. The myth that onshore wind destroys tourism was thoroughly explored and no evidence to support it was found. The myth that wind power does not reduce carbon intensity was blown away in the breeze by no less an authority than National Grid itself.</p><p>The myth that wind intermittency presents a problem and negates carbon savings was revealed to be nonsense by National Grid and others. Another myth was that consumers are paying very high premiums to subsidise renewables, but the figure is now known to be of the order of &#163;21 per annum, which is a tiny fraction of annual fuel bills. The committee made its view clear in paragraph 196 of the report, which says:</p><p>&#8220;It is the Committee&#8217;s view therefore that renewable energy represents a safe bet both for energy security and for protection from price shock.&#8221;</p><p>I particularly welcome the target of 500MW for community renewables, which offers the possibility of transformational change across the Highlands and Islands and elsewhere. When I look at what the Shetlanders have done&#8212;I thought that Tavish Scott was here, but he is not&#8212;with their oil fund, whereby a small levy on the oil that passes through their community has provided community facilities that are second to none, I see a model for what can be done in the rest of Scotland.</p><p>When I think of the difficulties faced by Scotland&#8217;s islanders, who have struggled for generations in the teeth of a hostile climate, and the opportunities now offered by these exciting technologies, I am filled with great hope. That hope is increased when I see the world-leading research that is being done at the European Marine Energy Centre, with young Orcadians returning to Orkney to take up the exciting and cutting-edge career opportunities that are now available.</p><p>In considering the challenges in achieving our targets and the full potential of our renewables opportunity, one group of problems looms larger than others&#8212;those that are entirely within the province of the UK Government. Those include: damaging and disproportionate transmission charges for Scotland&#8217;s islands; a failure to invest enough or early enough in upgrading the grid; delay and uncertainty on energy policy, manifested now in setting strike prices for contracts for differences; inordinate delay in introducing the domestic renewable heat incentive; and a green deal that is not the right deal for the right people.</p><p>The list is long and, once again, the UK Government has made the case quite eloquently for such decisions being best taken here in Scotland, in this Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684775", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy Targets"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I commend my colleagues on the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee for their extensive work on this important inquiry.

My only point of disagreement is that Ms Dugdale and her colleagues on the Labour benches seem content to allow the UK coalition to keep hammering the Scottish people at every turn while apparently suggesting that the only solution lies with the Scottish Government. The proposition that the Scottish Government, with its limited resources, can ameliorate all the harm that is being done by the Tories and the Liberal Democrats is simply not credible; it is a bit like asking the Scottish Government to chase escaped horses while the UK Government stubbornly refuses to lock up the stable.</p><p>The obvious solution is for the UK Government to continue to pay attention to Mr Ewing&#8217;s call for it to cap interest rates on payday and similar loans. Given the background of what most commentators are now calling the great recession and in the face of the exorbitant loans that the UK Government refuses to regulate, it is hardly surprising that over the past few years and until just recently the number of personal bankruptcies has been increasing. The latest figures apparently show that we might have turned a corner in that respect, with, as I understand it, the number of bankruptcies last year falling by about 30 per cent, but we need to treat such figures with caution, especially as financial difficulties are bound to increase as the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reforms come down the track.</p><p>Against such a difficult background, the Scottish Government has to be congratulated on its efforts to continue to refine the debt arrangement scheme, which offers a very constructive alternative to personal bankruptcy by making it possible for a debtor to repay the money owed over a reasonable timescale. Indeed, the increase in debt payment plan approvals under the scheme might be part of the reason for the reduction in personal bankruptcies. It is an infinitely preferable solution for both debtors and creditors, who will at least have their original debts repaid. I am delighted that successive reviews of the DAS have shown that it can be improved in ways that strike a balance between the needs of debtors and those of creditors. Given the time that it can take to approve debt payment plans, it is only right for interest and other charges to be frozen at the start of the application process rather than at the end.</p><p>However, I have to say that the person who really needs counselling from a money adviser is George Osborne. The problem with very rich people such as Mr Osborne is that they never have to think about money and, because they never have to think about it, they never come to understand it. A debt payment plan for the UK is urgently required and any money adviser would advise Mr Osborne that the debt should be paid over a suitable period.

The planning system is immensely important to delivering sustainable growth and safeguarding our built and natural environments. In short, the planning system delivers our future.</p><p>Incidentally, my first application was for the renovation of a cottage and it was refused consent. The cottage is still a ruin and, for me, that points the way to how we must judge our planning system: on the outcomes that it produces. That the cottage I referred to is still a ruin is not, I suggest, anybody&#8217;s idea of a good outcome.</p><p>I suggest, too, that there has not been much construction since the inception of the modern planning system in the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947 that we can be all that proud about. When I look back at the past 65 years or so of building, I do not see all that much that would win design awards. I ask myself: where are the listed buildings of tomorrow? Where are the conservation areas in the making? I therefore have some sympathy with those who feel that our planning system fails to deliver quality of development, which is perhaps why so many people are against any and all development.</p><p>That is why I am glad that the minister recognises the need for improvements in place making and design quality. Our planning system has often shrunk from the subjective nature of determining design quality, but in reality there is a much wider recognition of good and bad design quality than we sometimes acknowledge. When a planning system fails to address that, it fails entirely.</p><p>My focus as a Highlands and Islands member is inevitably on rural planning issues. Although those are similar to many of the issues that are found across the country, there are of course particular rural concerns. Perhaps the most important of those concerns is the rural housing problem. I note that the then Rural Affairs and the Environment Committee&#8217;s 2009 housing report included recommendations on improving the planning system. It is therefore a disappointment to me that at a recent meeting of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on rural policy, on the theme of housing, the discussion again focused on planning as a significant problem in delivering rural housing.</p><p>When it is considered that Scotland&#8217;s population density is among the lowest in Europe&#8212;the Office for National Statistics quotes it currently at 67 people per square kilometre&#8212;and with only 3 per cent of the population living in 50 per cent of our most rural land area, the constraint on housing land that is imposed by our planning systems in many rural areas is unfortunate to say the least. However, the flipside of the statistics is that 81 per cent of our population lives in open areas covering less than 6 per cent of the land area. That puts many of our planning issues into perspective. Even before the credit crunch, Scotland was not a country groaning under development pressure.</p><p>I welcome the current planning reforms, as the need is for continuous and incremental improvement. I also welcome the minister&#8217;s recognition that our planning system must become more efficient and simpler. Even after 35 years, I often struggle to understand the complexity of local planning policies and of letters that I receive from heads of planning. More worrying is the fact that when I talk to council members who are taking planning decisions, they seem to understand them much less than I do. I have some sympathy for planning departments that struggle with a lack of resources, but I have to temper that sympathy with the observation that my mailbox is stuffed with complaints from constituents about overzealous efforts being applied to often petty and trivial enforcement issues.</p><p>I am therefore glad that the minister has struck a careful balance between increasing planning fees, which will add a further burden to development costs in difficult times, and increasing resources to planning departments, and that he sees the clear need to link increased resources to improving efficiency. I welcome, too, the focus on plan-led planning practice and efforts to engage more people at that earlier stage rather than have engagement that is merely reactive to applications. Most of all, I welcome the minister&#8217;s focus on improving the culture in which we deal with planning, because improving the culture and paving the way towards a more enlightened planning system trumps all other possible improvements.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681369", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the debate, not just because I have been wrestling with, reading about and thinking about our planning system since I lodged my first application, nearly 35 years ago, but because few subjects merit more attention.

We were told that there really was not very much oil there at all, and I am old enough to remember that we were told that it was somehow the wrong sort of oil.

The reality has been, and is, quite different. More than &#163;300 billion in oil revenues has been sent to the Treasury, and Scotland&#8217;s oil has been one big fat golden goose that has somehow survived the abuse of considerable fiscal uncertainty as successive Westminster Administrations have seen how much it can be squeezed with a sometimes careless abandon with regard to the wellbeing of industry or its future.

So much for Scotland&#8217;s oil running out. That equates to about 40 per cent of oil by volume still to come, and at least 50 per cent of oil by value.

I am sure that he would be more than surprised to know that he founded an industry that now supports about 10 per cent of employment in Scotland and which, even in these dark days of recession, grew last year at a rate of 9 per cent. When much of the rest of the economy is flatlining, that is a very healthy rate of growth. Tourism is yet another industry in which Scotland bucks the economic trends and outperforms the rest of the UK, and it takes more than 20 per cent of the overall UK tourism spend.</p><p>In one way or another, every person in Scotland benefits from this dynamic industry. That is why all members of this Parliament should support it and consider themselves as tourism ambassadors for Scotland and talk up Scotland&#8217;s many virtues.</p><p>If there is a segment of the tourism industry that deserves special consideration, it is business tourism. Business tourism leads to many other benefits, such as business contacts and business contracts, repeat visits, and export and investment opportunities for Scotland. It is worth contemplating why Scotland is so successful in that sector. It seems to me that something about Scotland inspires creativity. It was not an accident that the industrial revolution started here with James Watt&#8217;s steam engine. It was not an accident that the enlightenment started in Edinburgh and that Adam Smith founded modern economics here in Scotland, which was a precursor to the modern business landscape that stretches across the globe. Those things were not accidents. There is something about Scotland, something about our landscapes and something about our people and our manner of discourse and dialogue&#8212;although not always in this chamber. There is something about Scotland that inspires thought, and which inspires creativity. Business, if it is to be successful, must be all about creativity, because creativity leads to innovation and innovation is the key to success in business, as it is the key to our economic success as a nation.</p><p>What better place to refresh tired minds and to rediscover a passion for success than Scotland? That is why business tourism is growing in Scotland. So let us start talking Scotland up, and let us tell the world that we want to do more business.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s business is no longer centred exclusively in our cities. I am thinking of the biomara project at Dunstaffnage in Oban, where we lead the world in marine research with a project that aims to capture the vast productive powers of our oceans in producing biofuel. Think of the business spin-off that will be engendered by that project.</p><p>I am thinking of the European Marine Energy Centre on Orkney, where we lead the world in marine renewables research and development. That has led to inquiries from Korea, Japan and the US to teach them about marine renewables. As people from other countries learn from us, we will learn from them. Learning from each other and doing business with each other go hand in hand, for business is about mutual benefit and the best of business is often centred on friendships.</p><p>As Mary Scanlon said, we must always strive to improve our competitiveness and we must address the impediments to this successful sector. Dr Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, appeared before the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee only a couple of weeks ago. He said that inbound air passenger duty</p><p>&#8220;is not about austerity; it is lunacy.&#8221;</p><p>He also said that the UK is</p><p>&#8220;one of only 14 countries that apply the full rate of VAT on restaurant meals; the average for the rest of the EU is 8.8 per cent, not 20 per cent.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, 12 September 2012; c 1897, 1896.]</p><p>We have the second-highest rate of VAT on accommodation in Europe; the average for the rest of Europe is 10.3 per cent, as opposed to 20 per cent. I agree with Mary Scanlon that we need to increase our competitiveness; reducing VAT would be a good way of doing so. I am forced to wonder why, in the face of all economic wisdom, the UK Government persists in overtaxing this area of industry and, indeed, any area of industry in which Scotland does well or enjoys an advantage.

I can personally attest that the work at the coalface of community development is often done in very difficult conditions, in the face of economic fragility and deprivation, and in a culture in which power is not always surrendered easily to communities that wish to grasp the opportunities available to them.</p><p>Nevertheless, since the right to buy was introduced in 2003, and especially when that was combined with the income generation opportunities that renewable energy projects offer to communities, community development has begun to transform the face of the Highlands and Islands. I could pay tribute to a very long list of communities but it is only right that I should pay particular tribute to my fellow islanders in the communities of Eigg and Gigha, who paved the way for many other communities. I know that the people of those two communities would agree that, having taken responsibility for community ownership, their path has not always been easy, but they would also agree that it has been worth while.</p><p>I am delighted that the Scottish Government has committed a further &#163;6&#160;million to the Scottish land fund, because there is an appetite on the part of many more communities to benefit from bringing local land and local assets into much more productive use. That is why I am also delighted that the right-to-buy legislation will be revisited and reviewed so that we can apply the lessons that we have learned over the past nine years or so and improve the legislation. However, it is right that we should take our time with that and with the proposed community empowerment and renewal bill, because these are complex matters that are sometimes fraught with difficulties, which can be hard to appreciate except by those who are actively engaged in community development at the grass roots.</p><p>The community empowerment consultation covers a number of areas and proposes a number of interesting ideas&#8212;all of which have merit and which I am sure will, at least in theory, receive support across the chamber. However, it is crucial that the practical implementation of those ideas is considered carefully, all the more so because we owe it to volunteers and community activists&#8212;the people who give up their valuable time without recompense&#8212;across Scotland to get it right and not to present them with more difficulties than they already face.</p><p>I am particularly glad that consideration is being given to extending the right to buy to urban areas. Too often, there is an urban-rural divide. Opportunities that are open to rural communities should also be open to urban communities and to communities of interest.</p><p>The underlying theme seems to be one of bringing assets into more productive use. Should it really matter whether those are in rural or urban areas or how a particular community is defined? That applies equally to underused public properties. Who owns public properties should be neither here nor there, because they are public assets&#8212;they belong to us all.</p><p>Empowerment of communities means disempowerment somewhere else, for power is neither created nor destroyed. Too often in Scotland&#8217;s past, power has been expressed as the ability to say no to the legitimate aspirations of individuals and communities. Real power is the power to say yes and to facilitate the aspirations of Scotland&#8217;s communities. I am therefore delighted that this Scottish Government is taking forward the consultation with a will to share power and to do so wisely to empower communities and to engage them in their own success by giving them the tools to secure better futures for themselves and, ultimately, for us all.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pay tribute to all the many community volunteers across the Highlands and Islands&#8212;indeed, across Scotland&#8212;who work selflessly for the benefit of their communities.

Most of all, I want to record a personal thanks to Professor Kenneth Reid, who provided us with specialist legal advice. It is a great tribute to him that he did so in a way that facilitated our understanding, as lay people, of some fairly technical issues with both humour and patience. I also thank the many witnesses who gave evidence, and the people who wrote to me and took an interest in the committee&#8217;s work.</p><p>We all agree that the bill&#8217;s general thrust and focus is to be welcomed. Completion of the land register is itself a worthy goal. Smoothing and rendering more efficient the processes that pertain to property transactions are equally worthy objectives. However, my concern throughout has been that, in our bid to complete the land register, we do not sacrifice quality for speed and that we recognise some of the problems of the system and attempt to deal with them, so far as we reasonably can.</p><p>I am therefore glad that Mr Ewing, the minister, engaged constructively with the committee and with the various stakeholders. He listened carefully and responded to suggestions for improvements to the bill when it was wise to do so. For example, in section 42, on prescriptive acquisitions, he reduced the period of abandonment of land from the originally proposed seven years. That is only one example of a practical and wise judgment being made when it had to be made.</p><p>A certain amount of idealism was displayed in the amendments that were lodged by some of my colleagues on the committee. Idealism, of course, is a fine thing and I am glad that the spirit of idealism is alive and well in the Parliament. However, we must never enforce our idealism when it will cause harm and difficulty, when ordinary people going about their business will be victims of that idealism, or when the practical difficulties far outweigh any benefits that the idealism might bring. I therefore hope that Mr Harvie and Ms Grant will understand why I felt unable to support their amendments.</p><p>However, even the best of systems can never be perfect. Despite the keeper&#8217;s reassurances that all was well, I felt that it was important that a more efficient and perhaps more cost-effective mechanism than the courts ought to be available for resolving mistakes or disputes. I was therefore glad to be able to lodge an amendment at stage 2 that will have the effect of allowing the Lands Tribunal to provide such a mechanism. The unanimous support that the amendment achieved in committee was due much more to the common sense of my colleagues and the compelling evidence that we had heard than to any persuasive ability on my part.</p><p>The bill has been much improved in its course through the Parliament.

They have been warned of that risk repeatedly, but they have ignored all the advice that they were cutting too quickly and too deeply and that if they did not produce growth, the fiscal situation would worsen in the face of a shrinking economy.

I compliment my colleagues on the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee on a good example of working together in a largely consensual but effective manner in our scrutiny of the bill.</p><p>An effective land registration system is of fundamental importance in a property-owning democracy. Although I support the general aims of the bill, it is unfortunate that we do not seem to pay sufficient tribute to our original register of sasines. Cumbersome as it now is, it has operated fairly well over a considerable period and we must be careful that our efforts to modernise the system do not have unintended consequences. It is easy to criticise the old system. While it is true to say that there are many old titles that are vague or inaccurate, it is also true to say that some titles approach the level of works of art in their efforts to describe and define properties accurately. As a body of documentation, they describe much of the history of our country and are a tribute to our legal profession. They remain a valuable resource and, where possible, should be used to clarify current title certificates.</p><p>Modernisation presents considerable challenges. The Ordnance Survey map is not always as accurate as it ideally should be, especially in rural areas, which has given rise to historical errors and continues to give rise to errors. With modern global positioning systems and other surveying systems becoming increasingly capable of affordable accuracy, many of those errors are coming to light for the first time. Human error, whether from historical bad drafting of titles or from errors in first registrations, must also be acknowledged. Any modernisation system must provide an efficient and cost-effective mechanism for the resolution of those mistakes.</p><p>I am glad that the bill also contains proposals to improve the situation regarding a non domino acquisition, as such acquisitions often present opportunities to correct historical errors or unfairnesses.</p><p>We received a lot of evidence from Andy Wightman. I have a great deal of respect for him and the idealism that he advocates, but his suggestion that we should advertise or hold auctions of land of unknown ownership could give rise to profound practical difficulties. Nevertheless, I congratulate him on his recent book, which is a readable and lucid account of what can, in less capable hands, be a dry subject.</p><p>Finally, I must support my friends in the legal profession who are rightly concerned about the proposal in section 108 to introduce a criminal offence for what might be innocent errors on their part. That might create onerous obligations on them and on buyers or sellers, who would be required to protect their innocence.

The ferry that serves the small island on which I live is an overgrown rowing boat, which has an engine that works most of the time. In the old days, the ferryman used to row the boat, but nowadays he is a wee bit smarter; if the boat has to be rowed he makes the passengers row it. I come from a long line of ferrymen and mariners, so I have a special interest in ferries and in islands.</p><p>Thinking about the debate brought back memories of when I first heard the term RET, from a relative who worked for CalMac long ago. He was an islander too, and I remember him being quite excited about RET. I was in my early teens at the time&#8212;I am talking about quite a long time ago&#8212;and as the years and decades passed, hope of RET being introduced faded and many of us thought that that wonderful concept, which would level the playing field between the islands and the mainland, would never be realised.</p><p>I am therefore proud that in the previous session of Parliament the SNP Government introduced the RET pilot for the Western Isles and the Argyll islands of Tiree and Coll, with a promise that if the pilot was successful the Government hoped to roll out RET to other islands. Predictably, the Opposition parties&#8212;in particular the Labour Party and the Lib Dems&#8212;offered nothing but criticism. I can almost forgive them for that, as it is perhaps what they feel they ought to do, but what I find really hard to forgive is that they busied themselves with blowing on small embers of discontent in the hope of fanning them into a bonfire, and followed an agenda of the most naked political opportunism.</p><p>Fortunately, many islanders of good sense were prepared to wait and to place their trust in the SNP in the hope and expectation that we would deliver RET for other islands, given time. I am therefore delighted that there is now a commitment to roll out the scheme to many of the other islands, and that we have repaid that trust.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are yet again hindered in our efforts to improve ferry services by the Westminster Government, which is imposing quite draconian cuts to the Scottish budget. RET requires more capacity on some routes and it requires new boats. That is a tall order indeed, when capital budgets are being cut by 32 per cent. It is a tall order when revenue budgets are being cut and it is an especially tall order when much of the existing CalMac fleet is getting to be past its sell-by date.</p><p>Neither RET nor the ferries review offers the perfect solution to our islands&#8217; needs but, in terms of improving ferries, the SNP Government has already, in a few short years, achieved an awful lot&#8212;much more than any of the previous Governments in this Parliament, or those in Westminster for a generation and more.</p><p>Predictably&#8212;again&#8212;the Opposition parties will carp and criticise, but the suggestion that we can do much more in these difficult times is the kind of fantasy politics that will fool not many people, far less Scotland&#8217;s islanders, who are known for their pragmatism and common sense.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661526", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Road Equivalent Tariff (Commercial Vehicles)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to be able to speak in this debate, because I have lived on an island for more than 30 years, so I have an appreciation of ferries that is sometimes lost on mainlanders.

Initially, dial-up connections offered limited usefulness, although I remember printing out a copy of the first e-mail to arrive in the tiny island where I live and handing it to a local museum. Somehow or other, I understood that something significant was happening, although at that point the usefulness was pretty limited because so few people had e-mail addresses.

I must add, though, that I am lucky. For reasons that are unknown to me, not all my neighbours enjoy that staggeringly high speed. Yes, I am lucky with my 4 megabits per second because I can shop for bargains on the internet and at least partially offset the higher cost of rural living; I can be as well informed and as socially connected as anyone else in the country; and, as a citizen, I can participate in the democratic process, even to the extent of fulfilling my duties and obligations as a member of the Parliament.</p><p>Not all my constituents in the Highlands and Islands region are so fortunate.

I know, too, from my own previous occupation how difficult it is to work outside all day, often battling against the elements and dealing with the practicalities of running a business, then to come home at night to face a mountain of paperwork.</p><p>I know, too, of farmers whose fathers and grandfathers were farmers and who wish, in their hearts, that their sons and daughters, too, could be farmers, but whose heads now dictate that they advise their children to take up other occupations. I share their sadness at that.</p><p>However, our farms are still in many ways the mainstays of our rural economy, and they represent a culture, tradition and way of life that has been passed down through the generations. They have been the custodians of our environment and they are the reason why we still enjoy a high quality environment.</p><p>Thanks, again, to the energy, the effort and the enthusiasm of Richard Lochhead and to the hard work of our farmers and others in the supply chain, in the face of global competition, our farm produce&#8212;our wholesome Scottish food&#8212;is increasingly being marketed and brought to the tables of Scots and of others around the world, with exports significantly increasing as the quality of our produce is internationally recognised. That, in turn, feeds into our tourism industry, and I am pleased to see that across the Highlands and Islands, people can now in many of our restaurants and hotels eat the top-quality produce of our land and our seas, which adds immense quality and value to the visitor experience.</p><p>I welcome the proposed greening of our agriculture, but only as far as it can be implemented with the willing consent of our farmers. They are the local experts and I have concerns that the particular challenges that our Scottish farmers face will not be understood properly in Westminster.</p><p>Whatever the final outcome of the negotiations with Brussels, Scotland's farmers must be listened to and be heard. I know that the cabinet secretary is listening, but I have concerns about the challenges that he has in being heard properly in Brussels. After all, he has too often had first to fight the UK Government for the opportunity of taking the case of our Scottish farmers directly to Brussels.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658824", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy (Reform)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I have a confession to make: I cannot pretend to understand properly the common agricultural policy, some of which is mind-boggling in its complexity.

Most of all, it is a plan for long-term economic recovery based on the sound principles of infrastructure investment. It will leave a lasting legacy for future generations as well as creating jobs and prosperity in the shorter term as we work through each and every project on this extended list.</p><p>It is a plan for economic success where the UK Government has no plan. It is pitiful to witness the UK Government&#8217;s return to the dangerously naive grocer-shop economics of the Thatcherite era. The great English economist John Maynard Keynes first recognised the pivotal role of Governments in returning an economy to growth and at no time since the 1930s should those lessons have been heeded more closely than now. The UK Government&#8217;s response to our economic difficulties seems to be inspired by the fiction of Charles Dickens. It is an amalgamation of Mr Micawber&#8217;s belief that something will turn up and an austerity programme that is worthy of Scrooge. I can only hope that Messrs Cameron and Clegg are visited by ghosts this Christmas, because they seem not to be open to persuasion by anyone who is alive.</p><p>In contrast, the Scottish Government offers a plan and a message of hope. There is hope for our beleaguered Scottish construction industry, which stands ready to help us to build our way towards economic recovery. There is hope for communities and businesses, which wrestle daily with inadequate infrastructure. There is hope for people without jobs and for people without homes.</p><p>As a member for the Highlands and Islands, I am pleased that the plan contains a commitment on improvements to the A82, not least by dealing with the long-standing bottleneck at the infamous Pulpit Rock. The A82 has been one of the principal routes to the north and the west for more than a generation, and the bottleneck has served to illustrate the poverty of our infrastructure and a poverty of aspiration on the part of every previous Government of the country. It has illustrated the poverty of ambition on the part of the previous Labour-led coalition, whose interest rarely extended beyond the central belt.

I spoke then about my experience of being rescued by the coastguard following the loss of our boat in storm conditions one dark night in September 1977. I owe my life to the coastguard service, which co-ordinated the search and rescue that ended successfully when I was airlifted off a wave-swept, tiny rock at 8 o&#8217;clock the following morning.</p><p>In particular, I owe my life to the local knowledge of the officers of the Oban coastguard station, which is now closed. Through that local knowledge, they were able to focus the search on the small area of sea where they knew I was most likely to be. They were able to do so because of their intimate understanding of the particular wind and tidal conditions that prevailed that night, because they had a close relationship with the other boats and individuals who participated in the search and because they were able to collaborate with and trust the knowledge of the crew of the fishing boat that found me.</p><p>I come from a family with the sea in their blood. My grandfather was a ferryman and fisherman. My great-uncle was a ferryman and my uncle was a puffer skipper. With members&#8217; indulgence, I will just pay a quick, affectionate tribute to that fine man, John MacFadyen of Lismore, who was the personification of Para Handy and who taught me all I know about the sea and an awful lot about life.</p><p>I also have cousins who are currently fishermen and ferrymen. I worked as a fisherman as a schoolboy and a student and I have spent much of my recreational time kayaking and sailing on the beautiful but sometimes treacherous waters of the west coast. Like all who spend much time on the sea, I have a profound respect for it. It has at different times filled me with awe and with fear. I have lost good friends to the sea and witnessed and lived through the mourning of our community when our young men have been lost to the sea. The sea has no hard shoulder where you can pull over when things go wrong. There is no handbrake on a boat. When things go wrong, it is often the only hope of the mariner that we have a first-class search and rescue service.</p><p>Some of the most dangerous waters in the world are found between the Mull of Kintyre and the Point of Ardnamurchan. The Sound of Islay is littered with wrecks. The proliferation of lighthouses built by the Stevenson family&#8212;at Skerryvore, Dubh Artach and elsewhere&#8212;indicates the profound dangers of those waters. The Corryvreckan whirlpool is said to be the third largest in the world&#8212;believe me, it deserves its fearsome reputation. Strong and sometimes perverse tides dominate large stretches of the coastline, which is littered with rocks and hazards. It is only with skill, experience and local knowledge that those waters can be navigated safely. Imagine the difficulties of co-ordinating and carrying out a rescue in those waters, almost always in bad conditions, often at night. There are radio blackspots; there are huge gaps in mobile signal coverage; and there are magnetic anomalies. Our technology, clever though it is, sometimes just does not work&#8212;as we know, even in this chamber. Thankfully, our lives do not depend on it.</p><p>The late Baroness Michie, many years ago when she was the Lib Dem MP for Argyll and Bute, fought and lost a campaign to save the Oban coastguard station. She did so knowing, as I do, the importance of local knowledge. She fought the fight with integrity and a passion for what was right. She was rewarded by re-election, and perhaps more important, by the respect and warm support of her constituents, which crossed the party divides.</p><p>The coalition in Westminster knows nothing of the hazards of the sea. It cares nothing, it seems, for the value of human lives. At a time when recreational usage of our coastal areas is increasing, and when we are at the start of the offshore renewables industry&#8212;with tidal generators planned for the Sound of Islay, and offshore wind turbines planned off the coast of Tiree&#8212;it is truly perverse that we should be cutting our coastguard service.

Architecture is the most public of our arts. It cannot be ignored. It affects the way in which we live, how we feel and our sense of identity. We can escape from Picasso if we want. We can escape from Da Vinci&#8212;perhaps even from his code. We can even escape from the Glasgow boys. However, we cannot escape from our architecture and our built environment. We cannot ignore it.</p><p>We also cannot easily escape from some of the mistakes of the past&#8212;the dismal architectural and planning mistakes. I judge policies by their outcomes and I am forced to reflect that in the latter half of the 20th century, after the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, we did not build all that much that we can be proud of or that future generations will admire as the listed buildings of tomorrow, and our planning system did not prevent the intensification of many of our social problems or the loss of community.</p><p>Those failures are symptomatic of a state in decline&#8212;the UK state&#8212;and the withering of the union and its associated creative energy. Architecture mirrors our triumphs and our failures. It can lift us up or it can drag us down. Like any art, it also expresses our deepest feelings, our confidence and our sense of wellbeing.</p><p>As an optimist, however, I see signs of hope in Scotland in this early part of the 21st century. This building, this Parliament, is a metaphor for that hope and for a rediscovery of our Scottish identity. As a newcomer, I find that this building is growing on me. It seems to reunite the old Scotland with the new. Queensberry house exemplifies respect for the past; the new part of the building exemplifies our newly awakened confidence and our internationalism. It is an interesting and complex building, and each part of it is interesting and complex just as each part of Scotland should be. Each part of it is different but linked by a common theme, just as Scotland has its regional variations and vernaculars that are linked by our national identity.</p><p>However, Scotland needs more than just one fine house. I have been encouraged, therefore, to see good examples of architecture springing up in the past few years. I am encouraged to see movements towards place making and masterplanning, which offer a means of reconnecting people with place&#8212;because if buildings are important, people are even more important. Architecture and planning must be about people and must be centred on people. We should talk about building not houses, but homes, and we should talk about building not just homes, but communities. Our design talents should not be confined to the blank pages of new communities and new homes but be used to alter and improve our existing communities and homes. Each of them is special or capable of being so; each of them deserves a quality of approach and treatment; and each of them deserves care and craftsmanship.</p><p>Every stage of the process needs to be enshrined in quality, from initial design right through to final commissioning. Each participant in the process needs to be enthused with the vision that we are together building a new Scotland. Of course, it will cost in labour, effort and the care that we bring to bear, and it will cost money to build a new Scotland that is truly fit for the 21st century. However, in that great labour we will rediscover our confidence, our capability and our creativity. Perhaps that is why the Westminster Government is so reluctant to assist us and why it refuses to contemplate reducing VAT on repairs and improvements to help Scotland&#8217;s hard-pressed construction industry. Perhaps that is also why it refuses to contemplate adequate borrowing powers for Scotland so that we can properly fund that work, and perhaps that is why it refuses to devolve corporation tax so that Scotland&#8217;s construction sector can become more competitive. Perhaps the Westminster Government is too feart because it knows that, in that great endeavour of building this new Scotland, our growing national pride will necessarily propel us towards independence.</p><p>In closing, I pay tribute to my fellow Highlands and Islands regional member, Jamie McGrigor, who seems to be the only member from the Tories and the Lib Dems who is not too feart at least to come to the chamber and stand up for Scotland&#8217;s built environment.

We had been alerted by the screams of women on board the yacht. We commandeered the only boat that was available, the Easdale ferry, which was an overgrown rowing boat with an outboard engine. There was a brisk wind, but we were experienced boatmen and conditions at that point were not serious. As we approached the yacht, however, our engine failed, the wind and the waves suddenly began to rise and we were swept northwards towards open water.</p><p>Before we could rig our oars, we were driven on to a rock. A huge wave arose out of the darkness and broke over the boat. My two companions were washed overboard and I was driven to my knees. The boat was swamped. Fortunately, as the boat was wooden, it did not sink, but successive waves washed over it, and I could breathe only between waves.</p><p>The boat slowly drifted northwards through the darkness and huge seas. Eventually, it turned over in the heavy surf that was breaking on the island of Insh. I half swam and was half washed ashore, on to a small rock. The boat was smashed to pieces in minutes. I found a depression at the top of the rock and I lost consciousness.</p><p>When I came to, parachute flares were in the sky. Somehow, my companions had made it ashore and raised the alarm. The coastguard was alerted. Oban lifeboat launched but&#8212;wisely&#8212;turned back in the horrific conditions just south of the island of Kerrera. Luckily, the coastguard was able to contact the skipper of the one local fishing boat that was capable of searching in such conditions, and it put to sea.</p><p>Local knowledge again came into play, as those on the fishing boat were able to narrow the search area to where they knew I was most likely to be. I was spotted at 3 am, but conditions were still too bad to launch a helicopter. A Sea King from RAF Leuchars picked me up at 8 am.</p><p>Without the specific local knowledge of the coastguard, acting in co-operation with the fishing boat, I would not have survived. That local knowledge encompassed intimate understanding of tides and local weather conditions, which can often be contrary and counterintuitive. It also included knowledge and understanding of the capabilities of local vessels and their crews, who are often asked to help in such circumstances.</p><p>The story has a sad sequel. The fishing boat skipper who braved horrific conditions to search for me, and his crewman, were lost at sea a few years later when their boat sank. Afterwards, a pall hung over our community for many weeks.</p><p>We who live in coastal communities will pay for the coastguard cuts and will count the cost in lost lives and needless tragedy. As we are developing our offshore renewables, our seas and coastal areas will increasingly contribute significantly to our prosperity. That prosperity will be delivered by men and women who will at times work in hazardous conditions. It is therefore truly perverse that the London Government should contemplate the proposed cuts at this time.

In our efforts to protect that environment, we must take care not to run roughshod over that home-grown environmental wisdom, because it springs from lifetimes of understanding.</p><p>If we are properly to realise our marine opportunities of wave, wind and tide, there is an urgent necessity to transfer the responsibility over and the revenues from our seabed to the Scottish Government.

Our scenery often masks rural deprivation and poverty. Fuel poverty, in particular, is common in rural areas and is often exacerbated because the full range of fuels is not available. Fuel poverty of another kind is becoming more apparent. Rural Scotland suffers from some of the highest fuel-pump prices in Europe, which is a disgrace in such an oil-rich country. People who have no public transport alternative often have to drive long distances and are crippled by high fuel costs. Despite assurances of intent from the Liberal Democrats in Westminster, the UK Government has so far refused to act on the issue. I call on all members of the Scottish Parliament to support our policy of establishing a fuel duty regulator and to demand that the UK Government take action.</p><p>In the previous session, the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee considered the important problem of rural housing. Much remains to be done.

It is where I was born and where I first made my home as a young adult, although, Presiding Officer, you will no doubt discern from my accent that I spent most of my formative years growing up in Glasgow. In my time here in this Parliament, I hope in some small way to help bridge the gulf of understanding that sometimes exists between urban and rural Scotland.</p><p>Becoming a member of this Parliament has caused me to reflect on my political awakening, which happened not suddenly but in stages. I recall the final stage of that awakening in late August 2001, as I was driving home from a six-month spell of working in London. I recall crossing the border and coming back into Scotland. I recall the air becoming immediately fresher, the sky bluer and the grass greener. No doubt we are all subject to such romantic feelings when we return to our homeland.</p><p>However, I was immediately confronted by a hard reality. The moment that I re-entered Scotland, the road quality deteriorated significantly. As I continued my journey home towards Argyll, the quality deteriorated still further. In places, the roads in the Highlands and Islands region are reminiscent of those in third-world countries. I think in particular of the roads on the island of Mull. Just as that is true of our roads, it is true of much of the rest of our infrastructure. I very much welcome the recent addition of the new ferry, Finlaggan, to the CalMac fleet, but I also know that most of that fleet is well over 20 years old.</p><p>During the first three sessions of this Parliament, the improvements have been insufficient and I have wondered why that might be. I do not think that it is because this Parliament and successive Scottish Governments have lacked the will to effect improvement. Having been a builder for more than 30 years, I am forced to disagree with our bard, Robert Burns, when he said,</p><p>&#8220;... makin roads</p><p>Is no this people&#8217;s study&#8221;.</p><p>It is neither lack of skill nor lack of study, but only lack of money that is at the root of that problem.</p><p>My former colleagues and workmates in Scotland&#8217;s sophisticated and capable construction industry stand only too ready to build better infrastructure for Scotland.</p><p>Each of us is a product of our experience. I can only reflect on mine and ponder that if I had lacked borrowing powers, I could not have provided a home for my family. I cannot imagine that many members have not availed themselves of a mortgage to buy or build a home for their families. I can also only reflect that of all the houses that I have helped to build over the past 30 years, I cannot recall one that was built without the help of borrowed money.</p><p>It is often said that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and nowhere should that be more true than in this Parliament. Our collective wisdom is and should be greater than the sum of our individual portions of wisdom. If members believe that it is wise to avail themselves of borrowing powers, how can any member believe that this Parliament and the Government that derives from it should lack those powers? That seems simple and self-evident.</p><p>It also seems simple and self-evident that we will never afford the quality of roads, public transport, hospitals and schools that we deserve if we have to meet their cost from each year&#8217;s budget. Such improvements provide long-term economic and social benefits and must be funded over the long term.</p><p>Rhoda Grant and Gavin Brown provided some helpful advice in this chamber only a few minutes ago. They reminded us that borrowed money must be repaid. I thank them both for those pearls of wisdom and remind them that capital assets should never be financed on the credit card schemes of PFI and PPP. In fact, if either of them would like to build Scotland&#8217;s first PFI home, I can recommend a number of builders who would queue in a long line for the opportunity.</p><p>Just as my political awakening happened in stages, it seems that the Opposition parties in this Parliament are awakening in stages and are coming round to the idea of borrowing powers for our Scottish Government. I welcome that, just as I look forward to their further awakening. I hope that they will agree with all of us in the SNP, who have long recognised that we will never achieve our aspirations for high-quality infrastructure and the prosperity that will spring from that unless we can obtain proper and adequate borrowing powers for our Scottish Government.</p><p>I issue a caveat for Opposition parties: borrowing powers must be adequate and they must be appropriate for their intended purpose. The timescale for repayment must recognise the lifetime of the asset that is being funded. Just as we must fund capital assets appropriately, so must we be in a position to weather the ups and downs of the business cycle. An overdraft that is too small may be as bad as no overdraft at all.</p><p>There is an urgency to all this in difficult times. The banks are still depriving the private sector of the oxygen of finance. Our budget will be cut year on year for the foreseeable future. I urge all members from across the political spectrum to add strength and force to our arguments for adequate borrowing powers; otherwise, there is a danger that in its present form, the Scotland Bill will become the anti-Scotland act.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648395", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill: Borrowing Powers and Growing the Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a great privilege to have been elected to serve the people of the Highlands and Islands region.
