We have also seen the fundamentals of co-operatives that allow people to organise worker-owner lives, which must be one of the best ways in which people can get a lift.

If it makes people feel good about going into the Oxfam shop and giving a little, the lifting lives for good campaign will benefit from their cash.

How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb? None&#8212;the light bulb has to be willing to change itself. Of course, it should now be an energy-saving light bulb. Change and adaptation are central to meeting the challenges of our changing climate.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee recently scrutinised the Scottish Government&#8217;s draft Scottish climate change adaptation programme. We heard evidence from stakeholders and from the minister, and we wrote to the minister setting out our views and recommendations to inform the final adaptation programme. The committee thanks the minister for his prompt and detailed response, which enables us all to consider that in this afternoon&#8217;s debate. The committee fully agrees with the minister that the long-term sustainability of Scotland in a changing climate is the responsibility of each and every one of us. As Morag Watson reminded us in a behaviour change session last September,</p><p>&#8220;when people are given the time and space to talk through certain things all sorts of issues come to the fore.&#8221;</p><p>Culture change is possible.</p><p>The extreme weather that we have experienced over the last few weeks also reminds us of the urgency of a change of outlook. Can the minister confirm that planning for a changing climate is being comprehensively embedded into Scottish Government policies? The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee&#8217;s work programme will focus our scrutiny of the forthcoming draft third national planning framework on how it will help to deliver Scotland&#8217;s climate change adaptation programme. The committee is pleased to hear that the minister is soon to write to the adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change to formally request that it carry out the first independent assessment of the programme in Scotland, and we look forward to seeing that report.</p><p>Further clarity is needed across all three adaptation programme themes with regard to project timescales, budgets and responsibility for development and implementation. Stakeholders want clarity on whether project finance is secure or is still required, on which is the lead organisation of implementation and, when a project is set to extend beyond the five-year lifespan of the programme, on how its progress will be monitored. The committee strongly agrees that a longer-term view would significantly aid the building of Scotland&#8217;s resilience. Will the minister consider how that can best be achieved in the final strategy?</p><p>The committee reiterates our appreciation of the vital work of our emergency and volunteer services in responding to extreme weather events. We would be interested to hear from the minister what lessons have been learned to inform the final programme. Evidence mounts on the risks that our infrastructure and built environment face from flooding, landslips and high winds. Also, our transport networks and energy, information and communication technology are situated in strategic corridors and can be vulnerable. Compromises on the speed and effectiveness of emergency responses could impact on the continuity of businesses, health boards and local authorities; indeed, they could affect the fundamental resilience of local communities.</p><p>We recommended that the final programme be strengthened to set out how the planning process could be used to embed climate change adaptation&#8212;for example, on the siting of new developments and infrastructure, particularly in housing, renewable energy and rural broadband roll-outs. The RACCE committee will inquire into how the planning process takes climate change issues into account in its forthcoming scrutiny of NPF3.</p><p>The importance of Scotland&#8217;s key economic sectors&#8212;food, drink, tourism and energy&#8212;and their value to our economy are well known. All are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, not only here in Scotland but at an international level, which affect supply chains. Our final programme must line up with the adaptation plans of other countries to protect supply chains for our businesses, including airports and telecoms. That will require international negotiation and discussion of the sort that our minister engaged in at the Doha round and later on the Kyoto protocols et cetera. It is essential that we make contact with other countries in which parts of our supply chains lie.</p><p>We welcome the minister&#8217;s assurance on how the travel information and flood and weather alerts that are provided by traffic Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, local authorities and the emergency services are being shared through the internet, social media and radio. That must continue to be improved and developed to serve our communities.</p><p>Especially in agriculture and seafood, smaller local businesses with shorter supply chains are of profound importance to Scotland. We agree that more attention should be focused on supporting smaller businesses to adapt to changes in the climate. We were pleased to note that the minister recognises that, and we welcome his confirmation that the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill will help small and medium-sized businesses to meet some of those changes.</p><p>The committee shares the strong concerns of stakeholders in the agriculture sector, for whom the negative impacts of climate change are very real. Growing seasons have changed, and farmers have already had to adapt what they grow. Farmers seem willing to make the changes, but there is a lack of knowledge transfer and they say that practical guidance and financial incentives are needed. I question whether those will be available. Forestry faces the biggest challenges through the loss of confidence in making resilient decisions, which is a result of the uncertain long-term effects of climate change and the invasive diseases that have been brought to our country.</p><p>The committee recommended that financial incentives, such as those in the new Scotland rural development programme and the common agricultural policy, be made user friendly and adaptable and that, wherever possible, they should have multiple benefits that help to deliver climate change adaptation and to improve biodiversity. The final programme should support people who are involved in making longer-term decisions. We are pleased that the minister has ensured that policies on land use that provide multiple benefits for our natural environment will be reflected in the final programme.</p><p>The committee was concerned to hear that 18 per cent of our coastline is highly susceptible to erosion. From that, coupled with the continuing rise in sea levels, it is clear that our coastal communities face significant risk. Regarding their protection, we need the minister to tell us whether the recent events have highlighted the need to accelerate that work. The statement that he made last week was helpful in letting us know that many people share our concerns on the matter. The committee heard about the new flood warning scheme that SEPA is operating. Can the minister tell us how effective that has been over the past few weeks?</p><p>In its letter to the minister, the committee sought an update on how the Scottish Government would prioritise investment in flood risk management. The minister confirmed in his response that the process would take place over the course of 2014 and that an update would be available towards the end of the year. Is the minister able to say whether the Scottish Government is still working to the same timetable or whether the events of the past few weeks have shown that the work requires to be accelerated? Many of my colleagues may wish to speak in the debate on some of the flooding issues.</p><p>We are pleased that the minister believes that more targeted support may be required for the most vulnerable in society, because equalities issues must be considered in the matter of climate change. People can be very vulnerable indeed because of climate change, not just in very shallow islands in the Pacific but right here in the heart of our cities. We must provide guidance to help them. Can the minister tell us more about how that will be taken forward, because we consider that social justice is part of climate change?</p><p>I hope that today&#8217;s debate will help to inform the final programme.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament welcomes the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee&#8217;s response to the Scottish Government&#8217;s draft climate change adaptation programme.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Climate Change Adaptation Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I crave your indulgence as I try to get all the detail in.

One of the 16 national outcomes in the national performance framework is that</p><p>&#8220;We reduce the local and global environmental impact of our consumption and production.&#8221;</p><p>Related to that outcome is the Government&#8217;s two purpose targets, which are</p><p>&#8220;To reduce emissions over the period to 2011&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;To reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050&#8221;.</p><p>Both those targets are shown as improving on the Scotland performs website. That is welcomed by the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee. However, the committee notes that the statutory climate change targets for 2010 and 2011 have both been missed.</p><p>In that light, my committee asked other committees in the Parliament to consider the climate impacts of the budget from their perspective. Ahead of their considerations, I wrote to all the relevant committees with a set of questions that would allow them to interrogate their own report. The first question was</p><p>&#8220;how the draft budget delivers proposals and policies that relate to their portfolio as set out in the RPP&#8221;.</p><p>The second question was</p><p>&#8220;how the draft budget supports measures aimed at making up the shortfall in emission reductions&#8221;</p><p>because of missed targets. The third question was</p><p>&#8220;how funding for those public bodies covered by their portfolio will help integrate action to tackle climate change in their business and service delivery functions&#8221;.</p><p>In addition to the questions that we asked generally, SPICe provided some detailed questions for the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, the Health and Sport Committee, the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee, the Equal Opportunities Committee and the European and External Relations Committee. Some of those questions seem to have been picked up, but others were not. Therefore, we had to assess exactly what the result was in terms of the climate balance in the budget discussion.</p><p>The Health and Sport Committee, the Justice Committee, the Local Government and Regeneration Committee and the Education and Culture Committee did not mention anything about the carbon content in the budget. I will give examples of the questions that were suggested for the Education and Culture Committee. We asked it:</p><p>&#8220;to what extent does funding for Scotland&#8217;s Schools for the Future programme support delivery of Scotland&#8217;s emission reduction targets;</p><p>to what extent does the skills and training budget support the opportunities associated with realising a low carbon Scotland; and</p><p>what progress are Historic Scotland making in integrating action to tackle climate change in its operation and service delivery functions and fulfil that duty under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act to contribute to Scotland&#8217;s emission reduction targets.&#8221;</p><p>We would expect each committee to use the questions that we provided to interrogate its own contributions, but the committees that I have just mentioned did not do so. I am delighted to say that the Finance Committee noted these issues and that the European and External Relations Committee, the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee all made substantive comments. However, when five other committees did not pursue any of the suggested issues, we in this Parliament need to ask whether each of its committees is taking seriously the role of climate change mitigation in all its responsibilities and whether the Parliament as a whole is meeting the aims and targets in the national performance framework. This is a serious issue. Before we get the Government&#8217;s response, we need some means of measuring how some of these matters might affect our approach.</p><p>Another example relates to the Finance Committee&#8217;s responsibility for scrutinising the Scottish Public Pensions Agency and its investments. How many of the investments in its portfolio boost the development of a low-carbon economy and how many have been invested in less environmentally friendly ways? We need to know that information and find some means of getting a response to such questions in future.</p><p>In its report, the Finance Committee states that it</p><p>&#8220;would welcome further details on the acknowledgement by the Minister for Environment and Climate Change that a &#8216;renewed effort&#8217; is required to meet the statutory climate change targets&#8221;,</p><p>which we missed in 2010 and 2011, and that it</p><p>&#8220;supports the view of the RACCE Committee&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>my committee&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;that &#8216;funding information for climate change mitigation measures should be published alongside publication of the draft budget&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>I would also add that it is essential that each committee makes its own input to ensure that we meet the aim, shared by the whole Parliament, of tackling climate change.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would like to concentrate on the climate change targets that are mentioned in the Finance Committee&#8217;s report on the draft budget.

The end-year fishing negotiations are vital to many communities that I and many other members represent.

That builds on the strong record of previous Scottish Administrations doing just that. However, Scotland is ready not just to have a seat at the negotiations but to take its turn in leading them. That would be a step forward for protecting and developing our fishing industry.</p><p>It is important to recognise that these end-year negotiations come down to a number of key aspects, which I will touch on. The starting point is the issue of landing obligations. We know that we will have a big job to measure how the discard ban is brought about. The way in which fish are sorted and weighed is quite important in that process and I ask the cabinet secretary to make sure that the control orders that deal with that rely on as little handling of fish as possible and move towards weighing being done at sea, with scales that are agreed by the authorities before the boats leave, and without the need to have so much of that weighing done and sampled on shore. The landing obligation leads me to believe that it is important that it is spread over all the species that are landed at one time because, as we move towards a discard ban, the job will be more complicated.</p><p>The SFF considers that maximum sustainable yield is</p><p>&#8220;a laudable intention but the way it is now enshrined in the regulation is scientifically impossible&#8221;.</p><p>If that is so, we have to find the cabinet secretary a means of cutting the Gordian knot, but in supporting the progressive move towards maximum sustainable yield by 2015 when possible, and no later than 2020, we are taking a realistic view of moving towards the means of sustaining the many mixed fishery stocks in our seas that we have to deal with.</p><p>The next issue I would like to deal with is licensing. Our country has a tremendous record of exports and the food and drink sector has led to a large amount of fish exports. It is therefore important that the licensing process for getting stocks from here to places such as China is made much simpler than it is at present. I am afraid to say that licensing can take weeks, if not months, and it must be speeded up in order to help exports to take place.</p><p>I will move on to talk about the coherence argument. WWF and the RSPB have said:</p><p>&#8220;Thanks to the progressive approach adopted by the Scottish Government in working alongside fisheries and environmental stakeholders in the Fisheries Management and Conservation Group, Scottish fisheries can better respond to the challenges of the new CFP regulation.&#8221;</p><p>I agree with that. A couple of Mondays ago, I was pleased to attend the launch of a sustainable food festival. It will be in Scrabster next September and will be based on fish.

Indeed, I am looking for an all-Scotland policy, and I want to look at some of the issues that the Government is raising positively to help us to have that all-Scotland policy, and to raise other matters of some concern.</p><p>Of course people need to have transport choices, but the choice is not necessarily to go faster; it can be about reliability and recognising that distance is one of the issues that we have to deal with. Indeed, if something is going to be sustainable in the future, it must be low carbon. The approach has to include trains, for example, rather than encouraging people to travel long journeys by road.</p><p>On roads and dualling the A9 south of Inverness, can the minister give us an idea of how the interim process involving the average speed cameras will work, given that average speeds will be higher than they are on the A77? People are looking for some help on that to understand how it will work.</p><p>Looking further north to my constituency, we can see that various climate change issues crop up. Extreme flooding has led to the need for a &#163;1&#160;million 30-week project on the A9 at the Portgower mill culvert bridge, beside the house of a friend of mine, Margot Macgregor, who has a massive building site outside her windows&#8212;it makes a change from the water from the burn being up to her kitchen window and frightening the life out of her. That extra piece of work is necessary. There are no other easy routes to the north. The A9 is the main road, and without it there are massive detours. We are therefore very pleased that such &#163;1&#160;million projects, which have to be slotted in, have been slotted in. That is welcome.</p><p>After 40 years of talking about the Berriedale braes on the A9 into Caithness&#8212;that section of road is perhaps the only alpine section of trunk road in Scotland, and it is very difficult to deal with&#8212;we have made progress through the stages in the past three years, with the help of the local estate. It came up with a simple plan that did not involve a massive flyover, which we could not afford. It has worked with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, the Scottish Government, the Highlands and Islands transport partnership and Highland Council to get to the stage of the technical survey. That is being done now, and I hope that that will deliver a shovel-ready project in the near future. Those things help long communication lines in Scotland to get access to the main road networks, and it is important to see them as things that need to happen soon.</p><p>I will briefly mention rail services in the time that I have left. We are glad that Conon Bridge station is opening, but we could have other stations on the north line. We need better rolling stock and for long journeys we need access to the electric sockets that the electric trains in the Glasgow and west of Scotland area have so that we can plug in our computers and get proper broadband. It is appallingly difficult to get any kind of broadband on the journey between Perth and Inverness or on journeys further north.</p><p>The potential for freight traffic on rail is exemplified by the whisky trains that are now going to go south from Elgin via Aberdeen. Every time that one of those trains goes it will mean that 29 lorries will be taken off the A9, which is a great innovation. However, the freight facilities grants must be rolled out to other things. As Direct Rail Services is moving nuclear waste by rail, let us hope that we can get the rolling stock to bring things up to Caithness on the return journey.</p><p>On air travel, I am very concerned about Flybe&#8217;s cuts in the number of its staff. We are at the end of the line in the north, so the regional airlines that provide lifeline services to Wick airport in my constituency and to the islands are an important part of our infrastructure. We would like the minister to take great care to ensure that the services continue. I heard a correspondent on the radio talking about some services having public service obligations, but very few of those lifeline services have public service obligations.

I would be very happy to host it, because a constituent approached me about the difficulties of gaining access to firewood on a private estate and the way in which the Forestry Commission offers firewood licences. The issuing of woodlot licences is a step forward from that, because they are about more than just extraction&#8212;they are about management, ecosystems and so on.</p><p>The Scottish Woodlot Association is to be hugely congratulated on its efforts. As it says in its briefing, it is a small organisation that has to learn to walk before it can run. We must try to help it to do so in different parts of the country. I think that that would best be done by promoting the excellent example at Corsewall.</p><p>In that regard, the briefing paper from Scottish Land &amp; Estates is very enlightened. It welcomes the project&#8217;s promotion. Indeed, it says:</p><p>&#8220;The rise in timber prices, demand for firewood and an increasing awareness of the economic value of previously abandoned woodland on farms and estates will ensure that the SWA has a great future.&#8221;</p><p>There is a huge amount of woodland that can be managed, and I welcome Alex Fergusson&#8217;s remarks about his practical experience on his previous holdings. That situation must be replicated in many parts of the country.</p><p>I would like the caveats about getting into more formal lease arrangements that Scottish Land &amp; Estates mentions in the section of its briefing on building confidence to be put aside because, in the first instance, the informality of the woodlot licence arrangements gives them strength. They do not involve the contractual issue that landowners find difficult. Scottish Land &amp; Estates mentions its fear of the threat that people gaining tenants&#8217; rights might turn into some kind of bid for ownership. We should lay that aside. I hope that the land reform process will allow us to get past the stage of thinking that every piece of land must be one that is bought. Although I believe that the issue of hereditary tenants in the farming sector must be given serious consideration, informal leases of the type that we are discussing will not lead to the same situation.</p><p>I repeat what I have said in the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee. The Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 ensured that it would be possible to create new crofts without having the ability to buy them, so it is possible to have leases of all sorts without that leading to a demand to buy at some time in the future. We should reassure Scottish Land &amp; Estates on that matter but ask it to be proactive in dealing with existing tenant farming problems.</p><p>This represents a great offer for every part of the country, and I hope that the Scottish Woodlot Association thrives. Of course, it has to walk before it can run and I, for one, would be very happy to host it further north. I once again congratulate Aileen McLeod on getting this debate on to the books.

They said that, when more people cycle, there are fewer accidents proportionately&#8212;we would agree with that. They said that cycle lanes encourage people to cycle and are most effective when they are physically raised out of the way of other traffic rather than simply painted with lines on the road. They also said that electric bikes are used on hills there and they encouraged people to use them here.</p><p>Traffic experiments to make people aware of cycling were seen in Copenhagen as an important approach. Lines on the road to show people where they are supposed to go are used temporarily, to stimulate the debate and encourage people to see cycling in a different light.</p><p>The number of deaths and serious injuries among cyclists there has fallen significantly in recent years, but the crossing by cyclists of a line of traffic&#8212;in Denmark&#8217;s case, that involves a left-hand turn; in our case, it is a right-hand turn&#8212;is very difficult even for people in Denmark to deal with.

Scotland has demanded an uplift in our rural development budgets; after all, we have the lowest budgets not just in the UK but in the whole of Europe. However, unlike how 16 other countries negotiated their deals, the UK failed to negotiate a special uplift or a fairer share for Scotland. That surely is a matter for deep concern across the Parliament.</p><p>To retain active agriculture and keep our land productive, maintain food production, safeguard our environment, remain competitive and maintain populations living in our rural communities, the settled view of Scotland is that we need on-going support from Europe. However the UK position is to end direct support for Scottish agriculture, in particular pillar 1 support. There is therefore a clash between the whole Scottish community and the way some parties in here wish to portray the motion. In order to reverse the decline in livestock numbers, to keep cattle and sheep on our hills, to protect our red meat supply chain and to produce for the domestic and export markets, Scotland wants the option of coupled support, but the UK position is that there should be no coupled support, so that is another fault line in the story.</p><p>Scotland is demanding that our cast-iron case for a fair share of the EU farming budget be recognised, but it has not been recognised in London. We receive the fourth-lowest level of payments in Europe, but the UK position is that the case has not been proved. Indeed, the UK is trying to invent other formulae to try to siphon away money that should be Scotland&#8217;s. When the cabinet secretary talked about stealing money, he was alluding to the danger that came from the mouth of Owen Paterson, the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He came to the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee on 12 June this year and said:</p><p>&#8220;I came in in September with a clear remit from the Prime Minister to grow the rural economy ... and to improve the environment&#8221;.</p><p>If he is intent on doing that for Scotland&#8217;s rural economy, he must prove that he is going to put in place the mechanisms that will allow us to grow it.</p><p>Mr Paterson also said:</p><p>&#8220;Working with ministers in the devolved Administrations, we have a huge role in helping to grow the farming and food production sector&#8221;</p><p>but how can we do that if there are no coupled payments and no proper supply of red meat? He said:</p><p>&#8220;I think that we have pretty much got an awful lot of what&#8221;</p><p>we</p><p>&#8220;wanted.&#8221;</p><p>I totally disagree. We did not get what we wanted because we still have the lowest payments in Europe.</p><p>Mr Paterson also said,</p><p>&#8220;The days of significant public support leading to the production of unwanted food products are gone, and my whole drive throughout the reform is to keep the CAP moving in the right direction&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, 12 June 2013; c 2369-74.]&#8212;</p><p>In other words, it is moving downwards and certainly not in support of the development of our rural economy. At a time when people are lining up to get food from food banks, the secretary of state in London is talking about &#8220;unwanted food&#8221; production. Surely there is an appalling disconnect in that respect. After all, this country would like to be able to feed all its people.</p><p>As I have said, Owen Paterson opposes pillar 1 support and thinks that we should rely on the market. However, he fails to see that coupled payments for cattle are key to protecting our biodiversity because they keep cattle on the hills and the machair. As a result, we need a strong pillar 1 alongside pillar 2 aims for public good.</p><p>Mr Paterson also recently described global warming as positive. That is incredible, particularly as our biodiversity is hugely threatened by global warming. Indeed, on Monday, The Guardian reported his praise of the alleged positives that will come from global warming. As the secretary of state in charge of tackling climate change at UK level, he should be well aware of the deeply damaging impact climate change will have at home and abroad, not least when it comes to our farming.</p><p>Unfortunately, Owen Paterson&#8217;s office has informed us that he will not be able to attend our committee as all his Wednesdays and Thursdays this side of Christmas are taken up. His diary is full. However, our demands remain unmet so I ask Parliament to support the motion, which gets to the heart of the matter and evolves a policy that can take Scotland&#8217;s food and drink forward.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698453", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The cabinet secretary was talking about the bits that we got into the deal in relation to dealing with active farming, the Scottish clause and so on&#8212;that is a win in a limited field of opportunity.

The Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Act 2013 and the stage 1 report on the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill were agreed to after detailed scrutiny, as has been said. All committee members signed up to the report; we agreed on the conclusions about the principles, with a few votes of dissent on certain paragraphs. We can be proud of that model of democratic scrutiny. It is made in Scotland and it is fair and above reproach.</p><p>That said, a major concern of members has been to include as many people as possible in the process of understanding the issues that are at stake and in being able to vote. That is why we spent time looking for ways to ensure that the disabled and people with limited eyesight can vote and why we considered whether prisoners should be able to vote.</p><p>I sought answers to many questions about the Electoral Commission&#8217;s role and how it intends to provide informative material to potential voters, all the way from registration&#8212;as agreed in the franchise act&#8212;and engagement to voting, which are in the bill.</p><p>We are talking about democracy in action. The committee&#8217;s report stands international scrutiny and is above reproach.</p><p>We agreed on the need for the Electoral Commission to produce clear and impartial sets of information. That should leave matters of substance for the yes and no campaigns to explain to voters. I have seen the materials that the commission produced in various languages for previous elections, which included translations of the ballot paper for voters who do not speak English.</p><p>Submissions to the Referendum (Scotland) Bill Committee and the Public Petitions Committee sought the inclusion of Gaelic on the ballot paper. As a committee, we did not consider that a persuasive case had been made for a bilingual ballot paper. One of the great virtues of the ballot paper that is set out in the bill is that it is simple and clear. No Gaelic speaker is monolingual, unlike some ethnic minority speakers for whom special help will be required and will be available.</p><p>Nevertheless, I believe that the agreed concept of equal respect for Gaelic as one of Scotland&#8217;s national languages, as set out in the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005, needs to be addressed in future. No attempt was made by the petitioners to have bilingual ballot papers in the 2007 and 2011 Scottish elections, the 2010 UK election or the alternative vote referendum, and I suggest that the petitioners&#8217; contention that the Scottish independence referendum is an event of national importance applies equally to those previous elections. Therefore, I believe that the future testing of such a bilingual text is a matter for this Parliament to address but not, I am sorry to say, in the context of the bill.</p><p>Equal respect for our native languages will probably come into perspective with the publication of the 2011 census figures, which is due later this month. I suggest that the Public Petitions Committee should deliberate on the best way forward for future votes after the referendum. Indeed, I believe that an annual debate should be held in the Parliament to discuss the progress of our indigenous languages in the life of the nation both in this and future parliamentary sessions. I hope that the Government will respond to that proposal whole-heartedly. For the referendum vote, I hope that all returning officers will make a Gaelic translation of the ballot paper available and on display at every polling station.</p><p>On awareness raising, the issues that are involved in the referendum need to be presented as fully as possible to encourage the maximum turnout. Therefore, on the issue of informing voters, I am delighted that the processes to take place after the vote are currently being agreed and discussed. We are told that senior officials from the Scottish Government, the Cabinet Office and the Scotland Office have met to hold discussions on agreeing a joint statement in response to the recommendation in the Electoral Commission&#8217;s January 2013 report that the public should be informed about what would happen after the referendum. Such information is essential to set the issue in the context of the move forward that we, on this side of the chamber, hope will take place.</p><p>Indeed, issues of prisoner voting, bilingual ballot papers and much else are subjects that an independent Parliament would be able to give proper scrutiny of and give full weight to in due course. I support the stage 1 report on the bill, which paves the way for a fair and internationally accepted referendum through consent and democratic agreement. The return of the full powers to an independent Scottish Parliament will be the best and fairest way forward for our country.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Independence Referendum Bill process has been conducted in the spirit of the historic Edinburgh agreement.

Historic Scotland is paying for people to come and look at the history, but they want to know about the myth. The two do not mix.

I certainly want to make such sites as available as possible to people.</p><p>Some of the scheduled monuments, such as Ormond castle in Avoch, remain only in part. Only the base of the walls remains there, because Cromwell shipped off the stone in order to build the citadel during his invasion and occupation of Scotland&#8212;the first time that the United Kingdom was created, although it was not a kingdom but a protectorate&#8212;in the 1660s. The castle has never been properly excavated, but it is linked to a whole story that Historic Scotland, the National Trust for Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and others have not made the most of. Andrew de Moray&#8217;s story could be told if that is what is wanted&#8212;his story is there to see in one of the panels in the tapestry, where he and Wallace are together as they were in history.</p><p>Ormond castle was the castle of Andrew de Moray&#8217;s family. He attacked Duffus castle in Moray. In 1335, because of his son, an interesting battle took place in Cromar, which is in Dennis Robertson&#8217;s constituency. A great granite pillar was put there about 50 or 60 years ago by the Deeside heritage society or the Deeside field club. That tells the story of the battle that took place half a mile away at the Burn o&#8217; Vat. Scottish Natural Heritage has refurbished its whole presentation of that area without any part of the human history being recognised. We need collaboration. We also need trails to show people from property to property, and to link them up with the characters in history that have been ignored by the people who look after only the buildings. We must ensure that, through the strategy, we bring the history to life because that has been missing.</p><p>Back in the 1980s, I was involved with others in setting up a link to get people to visit places where parts of the Highland clearances took place. I am glad to say that Grumbeg and Grummore in my constituency in Strathnaver are two places that have plaques that explain that they are clearance villages. Someone else described that as green tourism. It is important to recognise that, if people are taken to different parts of the country to see such sites for themselves, they can make up their own minds.</p><p>We must ensure that, through the strategy, we have an opportunity to seek interpretation in a full-scale way that has not been done before.

With a no vote, we face a future where we are without the powers to transform Scotland, where we will be unable to represent our vital farming, fishing and food interests in Europe, and where the needs of Scotland are seldom the UK Government&#8217;s priority. My committee&#8212;the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee&#8212;heard the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs rub that in when we heard from him last June. With a yes vote, however, we will have the normal powers and responsibilities of an independent nation and a seat at the top table to defend our rural interests.</p><p>Rural Scotland will welcome the programme for government. With the food standards (Scotland) bill, we, unlike Westminster, will ensure that the vital functions of the Food Standards Agency remain together to ensure that its primary function is consumer protection. Given the horse meat scare, it is all the more important to protect the reputation of Scotland&#8217;s booming food and drink industry. The community empowerment and renewal bill can increase participation in decision taking and in the design and delivery of services in local areas; it can also enable public assets to be taken over for local uses through the community right to buy. I have believed in that for many years, and I believe that it can be achieved by this Government.</p><p>Underpinning that, in a tax, financial and fiscal sense, are the revenue Scotland and tax powers bill and the tax management bill, which create the possibility of a distinctive structure and framework that will apply to all devolved taxes but also, potentially, to more taxes when Scotland demands them&#8212;and with independence, it will certainly demand many more. I will give an example of why that is needed. Land reform needs those tax powers and a lot more. Before devolution, the House of Lords in the Westminster Parliament could block the abolition of the feudal system. People recognised that then. Since 1999, Holyrood has abolished the feudal system, codified access laws and reformed crofting and some aspects of tenant farming, but not as much as we would like.</p><p>This summer, James Hunter and others pointed out in a briefing paper for the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee something that highlights the most concentrated pattern of land ownership in Europe: 432 people own half the private land in Scotland. The briefing says:</p><p>&#8220;Adept at maximising flows of public money to their estates, landowners have been equally skilled at minimising the flow of cash in the other direction&#8212;helped greatly in this regard by successive&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>I would add Westminster&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;Governments&#8217; toleration of a series of arrangements intended to reduce greatly, or even eliminate, effective taxation of landed wealth.</p><p>Those arrangements include:</p><p>&#8226; The various inheritance and capital gains tax reliefs and allowances available to landowners;</p><p>&#8226; The vesting of ownership in companies, foundations and other entities whose beneficiaries are obscured and concealed;</p><p>&#8226; The registration of such entities in offshore tax havens such as Grand Cayman, the British Virgin Islands, Panama and Guernsey;&#8221;</p><p>Those are all reserved matters. We cannot effect radical land reform until we have the powers to do so, and there is no chance in 100 years that Tory, Liberal or Labour Governments&#8212;and certainly not if the UK Independence Party is in any future coalitions&#8212;will make such a move.</p><p>The briefing goes on to say&#8212;and justify this&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;Although there is beginning to be anger in some quarters about such largesse (much of it directed at people of great wealth) at a time of unprecedented stringency in other areas of public spending, those arrangements have attracted surprisingly little scrutiny&#8221;</p><p>in Westminster</p><p>&#8220;and accordingly merit investigation by&#8221;</p><p>the Scottish Affairs Committee.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the programme for government, which tackles vital and urgent matters.

The people who argue that certain owner-occupiers who are crofters are concerned should understand that the simple answer is for those crofters to get registered. Thereafter, we can deal with the other matters as they come along.</p><p>It may be that Parliament and politicians are increasingly treated as some kind of joke. In certain discussions about a sort of crofting song contest, it was suggested that our committee should get a score of six out of 10 for trying. Frankly, that does not reflect the seriousness with which we dealt with these matters, and I would like to put on record my suggestion that those who wish to make those kinds of remarks should leave it to us to do that and, if they are lawyers, should offer us some advice rather than trying to grab headlines.</p><p>I am sorry to say that the approach I described was taken on more than one occasion. Eilidh I M Ross, of Inksters Solicitors said, in a written submission:</p><p>&#8220;it is simply not acceptable that the legislative framework which supports that system is such a shambles&#8221;.</p><p>It is not a shambles. It is not a mess. It is a matter of complexity, which we have inherited&#8212;indeed, it goes back to pre-devolution days, to the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 and before. Further, it is something that will take time to sort out. When, in the previous debate on this topic, Tavish Scott asked whether we could do some consolidation, I said that it would probably take two committee meetings a week for the next five years to do that, which means that we cannot approach it that way.</p><p>This bill deals with a simple point. There are other points that have to be dealt with, and I look forward to dealing with them, if we can, in a simpler fashion in our committee.

Members who read the House of Lords Hansard from that period will see that opposition. No one has quoted that yet, but I remember it well as I studied that period when I was a history student.</p><p>Johnston had the approval of the Prime Minister Winston Churchill and pressed home his advantage to create 54 main power stations by 1965 and 78 dams. At the peak, 12,000 workers were employed in their construction. However, in the 1950s, a Tory Government returned and duly set up a select committee on the issue, because it deplored the social clause in the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board&#8217;s constitution as an interference in the market.</p><p>The Government latched on to an obscure report by an economist from the University of Aberdeen that used complicated and biased means to prove that the relative cost of hydro was far greater than that of nuclear power. Indeed, Denys Munby&#8217;s paper claimed that nuclear power would make hydroelectric stations</p><p>&#8220;built at a very great capital cost ... as obsolete as the horse and carriage in fifty years time.&#8221;</p><p>Of course, he&#8212;like many people at that time&#8212;did not know much about the implications and environmental impact of nuclear power.</p><p>The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board pressed on with its plans, but it was stopped in its tracks in 1960, when the Tory Secretary of State for Scotland, John Maclay, took the whole electricity strategy to a Cabinet economic sub-committee. The committee stopped the River Nevis scheme, which would have extracted water and sent it to be stored at a power station near Fort William.</p><p>The Nevis scheme offers an example of an early campaign on landscape led by the National Trust for Scotland. Bill Murray, who wrote the book &#8220;Highland Landscape&#8221; for the NTS in 1962, called the Nevis gorge</p><p>&#8220;one of the principal scenic wonders of Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>The issue of appropriate development, with which we are very familiar today, was broached at that time.</p><p>The Mackenzie committee proposed that there should be one electricity board for Scotland and that the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board should go. However, a campaign in the Highlands raised the fiery cross via the electricity consultative council for the area, and people gathered round to save the board for another day.</p><p>A Labour Government was then elected, but it did not promote hydro. It called a public inquiry into the Fada-Fionn scheme in Wester Ross, and the Treasury stacked the figures by proposing an 8 per cent return on capital, so the inquiry found against the scheme. There was not a lot of opposition to the scheme from mountaineers or fishing interests at that time, although such views might have changed today.</p><p>Harold Wilson came in on the &#8220;white heat&#8221; of technology. He did not go back to the Johnston policy; instead, he supported nuclear power.</p><p>I come to the present. This weekend&#8217;s Herald magazine, New Era, quoted no figures from the Department of Energy and Climate Change in London for the cost per megawatt of installed power from hydro. It quoted figures for other sources such as onshore wind, nuclear and so on, but one cannot see where hydro fits into the picture. That is probably because there is only 130MW of capacity installed in England, whereas more than 1,300MW is installed in Scotland, so hydro is not a priority down south.</p><p>However, SSE has kept the faith and has refurbished dams and power plants. It has also created the Glendoe system, which we visited in 2009, and which&#8212;despite the problems with its tunnel&#8212;has produced electricity since 2012 as a major scheme in the Highlands. It is vital in helping the Scottish Government to meet its target for 100 per cent of energy from renewables by 2020, and it is a partner for intermittent wave and wind power. It is also a key part of an integrated electricity policy that suits Scotland&#8217;s needs.</p><p>There has been much talk about smaller schemes. There are a large number of them, many of which are in my constituency. A press release that was issued today said that one of the turbines in the Maldie Burn scheme, which the Duke of Westminster created, will run from this month. In that scheme, 2MW is used to power his lodge at Achfary and go on to the grid.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, only &#163;80,000 in community benefit will come from the scheme over its life. We have to ask whether everyone involved in hydro schemes&#8212;as well as those involved in wind, wave and tidal schemes&#8212;should pay at least &#163;5,000 per megawatt installed.</p><p>In my area, close to where I live, the Black Rock gorge scheme on Munro Ferguson&#8217;s Novar estate is nearly complete at 3.5MW. The Glasa scheme in Kildermorie&#8212;which the minister mentioned&#8212;is also close by, and has a capacity of 7MW. The numbers are adding up.</p><p>The Assynt Crofters Trust community scheme has had to overcome problems in respect of the great northern diver and other SNH concerns about wildlife, but it is now up and running for the community. The Lael Forest community hydro project near Ullapool is proposed to operate in places where old schemes had existed, and a public ballot will decide later this week whether that should go ahead for the community&#8217;s benefit.</p><p>The national problems of uncertainty about FIT from DECC show that capacity-based degression decreases the incentive to invest in hydro and many other schemes. Another uncertainty is that a pumped-storage tariff has not yet been created. We should recognise that it is entirely possible in this day and age to see the certainty that has been created by sticking to 1 ROC for hydro development in Scotland, not 0.7 ROCs, as a result of the Scottish Government&#8217;s far-sighted belief in an integrated policy.</p><p>&#8220;The Hydro&#8221; by Peter Payne quoted Sir Christopher Hinton as saying, in opening the Glenmoriston scheme in 1958:</p><p>&#8220;In 20, 30 and 50 years hence people... will say how tremendously fortunate it was that the water power development took place when it did.&#8221;</p><p>That was true then and it is very true today.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693928", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hydro Power"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tom Johnston brought about his hydro power revolution as a result of the particular conditions of total war, when landlord opposition could be waved aside in the national interest.

The Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 has, in part, required the Lord Advocate to appeal to the United Kingdom Supreme Court on the Salvesen v Riddell case. The judgment found in favour of the landlord, following a vain attempt in 2003 by the then minister, Ross Finnie, to stop notices to quit in the case of limited partnership tenancies issued during the passage of the bill that became the 2003 act. Such matters will have to be addressed within the next year, because of that judgment.

Will we look at that? We have heard nothing from Labour about taking control of the Crown Estate.</p><p>The Labour-Liberal Democrat Executive introduced the Cairngorms National Park Boundary Bill, which excluded north Perthshire. Could it not stomach having an SNP-led Perth and Kinross Council in the set-up? It took the minority SNP Government in 2007 to put that right, without opposition. I am sure that Labour could work with the SNP and other parties to address the core issues if it wished to do so.</p><p>To further that work, the European convention on human rights is key. It must be used to challenge on the basis of the public interest&#8212;a challenge that can be made only if we speak together with a united voice.

I will first look at some of the origins of that uncertainty, before looking at some of the effects.</p><p>Earlier this year, &#8220;Delivering renewable energy under devolution&#8221;&#8212;an academic study done in the four parts of the UK and led by Dr Richard Cowell&#8212;showed:</p><p>&#8220;We can point to a range of actions by the devolved governments&#8212;especially Scotland&#8212;that have shown significant support to renewable energy in the UK.&#8221;</p><p>Let us be clear: it also shows that the main policy-making powers and capacity lie in London, with DECC and the Treasury playing central roles.</p><p>Our energy policy in Scotland is very much a part of the devolved settlement. It has followed a model that was created in London and, indeed, in the conclusion of the report the authors point out:</p><p>&#8220;Among the devolved governments, political commitment to large-scale renewable energy development is longest standing in Scotland, being evident in the 1999 elections, allowing debates about delivery to develop sooner than in Northern Ireland and Wales.&#8221;</p><p>We can see that the issue of getting large-scale renewable energy came in with devolution, and we also know that the ROCs were set up in a fashion in 2002 under the Labour Government.</p><p>We have been following a model that emphasised the creation of large-scale development but, as Alison Johnstone has pointed out, there are alternatives. Denmark and Germany started to build from the bottom up in many cases, or indeed dismantled the top to create more local control. We have the potential to do that in our future as well, but we need to recognise that, in order to get the stability that I talked about at the start, we have to be sure that the contracts for difference will deliver it.</p><p>That is uncertain in the minds of those in the electricity industry. Scottish and Southern Energy said on 1 May this year:</p><p>&#8220;renewables developers do not have certainty over how the CfD will work in practice when the RO closes to new projects which are expected to begin generating after March 2017. This uncertainty has led to an investment freeze for those projects which are not certain to commission by that date; this freeze will exacerbate in 2013 as more projects reach the stage at which significant development investment is needed.&#8221;</p><p>Getting some security of investment is clearly a major part of the stability that we are talking about. It is underlined by why we have a renewables policy in the first place: it stems from the necessity to tackle climate change. The most recent UK Committee on Climate Change report, in March this year&#8212;I may have mentioned part of this before, but it bears repeating&#8212;states:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government has helped to provide longer-term certainty for industry by setting a 2030 decarbonisation target, which is in line with the Committee&#8217;s recommendations. However uncertainty over post-2020 support at the UK level may feed back to current investment decisions.&#8221;</p><p>The report reflects what producers such as SSE have said&#8212;that there is uncertainty in the process.</p><p>As one of the members who represent areas that can make a big contribution, it bothers me intensely that, in an attempt to argue that the UK market is more stable than a Scottish one would be, Ed Davey said on 19 March in Aberdeen that Scottish electricity generators have &#8220;unhindered access&#8221; to a market of more than 23 million households. I do not see the producers in the islands or the Highlands having &#8220;unhindered access&#8221;; I see a transmission system that makes it impossible for them to contribute on a level playing field. The electricity market reforms must address that. The evidence of our minister Fergus Ewing helping with the islands project also points to the fact that even electricity that is generated on the mainland in the north of Scotland will face a huge problem.</p><p>I will conclude with the question of what Britain requires. Decarbonisation is at the heart of the issue. A report from Scottish Renewables, which was also published on 1 May, points out:</p><p>&#8220;The UK Government estimates that in 2011 renewable electricity generation in Scotland displaced over 8.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.

Its near extinction from overfishing, pollution and climate change led to its being protected in 1998 and to a string of offences&#8212;45 in the past four years.

We have heard nothing, and we are likely to hear nothing, from the Conservatives about that. They present us with a motion that is a bit of a lucky bag&#8212;it contains a variety of sweets, but what flavours are they offering and whom are they aimed at? The Conservatives are aiming at a narrow base of people who do not want a balanced energy policy in Scotland.</p><p>I come from the area that is covered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and I have with me its advert from The Times from a couple of days ago. It points out that the area is home to more than 10 per cent of Europe&#8217;s wave energy resource, more than 25 per cent of Europe&#8217;s tidal energy resource and more than 25 per cent of Europe&#8217;s wind energy resource, as well as being home to more than 50 bio-energy related companies and more than 70 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s hydroelectric power, with investment of more than &#163;80 million in ports and harbours since 2010.</p><p>That balance in the area that I represent is the an approach that will allow us to make progress. However, I am afraid that there is an awful lot of imbalance at present. First, on community schemes, which Mr Macintosh mentioned a moment ago, I have direct evidence that landlords such as the Applecross Trust and the Mount Stuart Trust on Bute have a policy of refusing tenants and crofters who seek to erect a wind turbine or other renewable scheme. Of course, landlords always seek their share of the profits if they give such schemes the go-ahead. Many small landholders can be severely disadvantaged in comparison with their owner-occupier neighbours. I see nothing in the Tory motion about a shift in the balance towards crofters and tenant farmers.</p><p>We have the Scottish Natural Heritage map of wild land areas and a planning policy that recognises high nature value and so on. I can only interpret the grudging criticisms of that move, published alongside the careful planning rules, as another shot at the campaign by a tiny vocal minority who want to shun clean energy opportunities entirely. They want to hunt wind farms out of Scotland. They dismiss the climate change crisis while ignoring the blessings of Scotland&#8217;s uniquely favourable natural resource, which is a boon to our country, not a blight.

It has been a thorough, constructive and collaborative process, with the reports of four committees outlining how the draft document can be improved.</p><p>I firmly believe in the Parliament working on a cross-party basis in committees and here in the chamber to urge the Scottish Government to take on board our reports so that positive engagement by and with stakeholders will lead to a final RPP2 that is stronger, more transparent, more accessible and fully fit for its critical purpose.</p><p>First, the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee scrutinised broad governance issues in the development of RPP2. Will the document as a whole deliver the emissions reductions that are required? How will its implementation be monitored and evaluated? Secondly, we addressed interests that were relevant to our remit, such as emissions reductions in farming, forestry, peatlands and the marine environment.</p><p>We applaud the Government and the Parliament for establishing such ambitious targets, and we are pleased that Scotland tops the European Union 15 table for emissions reductions, but we must meet our future annual targets and the overall reductions targets that are set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, especially as we missed the first target in 2010 because of the poor winter. Thus, RPP2 must be a robust document that sets the framework for delivery.</p><p>The draft RPP2 will allow us to meet all our annual targets only if all policies and proposals are implemented, which we call on the Government to do. When the targets were set when the 2009 act was passed, it was envisaged that the EU would move from its current 20 per cent emissions reduction target to one of 30 per cent, but deep recession has sidelined that aspiration. Nevertheless, the Scottish Government should work with the United Kingdom Government to press the EU to adopt the 30 per cent target. However, the final RPP2 must demonstrate how greater domestic reductions could be achieved within the current EU 20 per cent target.</p><p>A forecast as far into the future as 2027 is not an easy thing for any Government to make firm policy and spending commitments on. Worryingly, the draft does not strike the appropriate balance between policies and proposals. It is unclear whether or when some of the proposals will become policies. Clarity is essential for properly researched, funded and monitored plans. Where possible, more detail is essential for each proposal in the final document.</p><p>Changing behaviour is the key challenge for delivering emissions reductions. Sadly, the Government&#8217;s behaviours framework was published after the committees concluded their evidence taking on the draft RPP2. Now that the document is out there, we firmly believe that the Scottish Government, as lead player, must guide Scots to meet their reduction targets, working with the UK Government, the EU, the public and private sectors, civic society and all our citizens to deliver sweeping behaviour change on the scale that is required.</p><p>I will move on to policies in the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee remit. We warmly welcome the restoration of our degraded peatland habitats, which make a significant contribution to locking carbon in the soil. We recommend that RPP2 policies restore 21,000 hectares of peatland a year and, on clarifying technical uncertainties, speedily adopt that proposal as a policy.</p><p>We welcome the practical forestry planting targets as important and the use of more Scottish timber in new-build houses as highly desirable. The potential to make much more of our new-build housing from native wood and the timber that is available should bring eco-friendly housing to the fore and make it a bigger feature in Scotland&#8217;s housing landscape.</p><p>Waste reduction takes a positive trajectory through the zero waste plan. Some real successes are evident in managing our domestic waste, on which we must build. RPP2 appropriately details how landfill emissions will continue to reduce, but the final document must embody the waste hierarchy&#8212;reduce, reuse and recycle&#8212;as part of the methodology, particularly to encourage behaviour change.</p><p>Farming poses the most arduous challenge. Behaviour change is crucial to delivering the required abatement and yet the farming for a better climate programme is practised by only a few farms at present. It is the agricultural section of the draft RPP2 that overtly relies on proposals and lacks enough detail. We want clarity from the Government in all those areas.</p><p>I truly believe that the four reports by the four committees of the Scottish Parliament should prod the Government to sharpen the final RPP2 to lead and deliver Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets up to and beyond 2027. We must come together to ensure that we deliver on the targets. We owe it to future generations to get RPP2 fit for Scotland&#8217;s low-carbon future.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the reports of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee and the Local Government and Regeneration Committee on the Scottish Government document, Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027 - The Draft Second Report on Proposals and Policies.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate provides the opportunity for mainstream scrutiny of the Scottish Government&#8217;s &#8220;Draft Second Report on Proposals and Policies&#8221;, or RPP2, which sets out how our Government intends to ensure that Scotland meets its world-leading climate change targets.

Their removal from Faslane and Coulport is supported by three quarters of Scots, or more. It would reduce the risk to Scotland&#8217;s environment of exposure to catastrophic damage caused by major nuclear accidents or by deliberate terrorist attack. However, UK policy concentrates its entire fleet of nuclear-powered submarines at Faslane, thus adding seven planned Astute class hunter-killer subs to the existing Trafalgar class and the Vanguard class Trident strategic missile craft. Even basing Astute and Trafalgar subs at Faslane perpetuates the threat of terrorist attack or catastrophic accident with their highly destructive conventional weapons, including cruise missiles, to which cyber attack adds new complications.</p><p>An accident could happen, not just at Faslane but anywhere that is frequented by nuclear submarines. Therefore, as Scottish CND has pointed out, the whole of Scotland is at risk. The UK Government ruled out an alternative home for Trident when Scotland regains her independence. It says that 166,000 people live within 5km of Devonport dockyard while only 5,200 live in a similar zone around Faslane. &#8220;Societal contamination&#8221; would be close to the &#8220;tolerability criterion level&#8221; despite the 2.5 million Scots who are living around Glasgow. But what is new? Unionists have been turning a blind eye to popular fears about nuclear accidents ever since Polaris was based at Holy Loch instead of Fort William or Mallaig.</p><p>As for the safety of submarines, Trident warheads and the life cycle of strategic weapons of mass destruction, we need some evidence. In April 2011, the Sunday Herald revealed that HMS Vengeance limped back to its Clyde base on auxiliary motors after a training exercise had to be cut short when an object blocked its propulsor&#8212;a large encased propeller at the stern&#8212;and slowed down the Trident sub John Large, a nuclear consultant, said in The Guardian:</p><p>&#8220;One of our top-secret stealth submarines was suddenly crippled at sea, making her a lame sitting duck on the surface.&#8221;</p><p>Another Trident submarine, HMS Vanguard, collided with a French nuclear submarine in the north Atlantic in 2009. The MOD has admitted that 16 crashes involving UK nuclear submarines took place from 1998 to November 2010 and that more than half of those accidents occurred in the seas around Scotland: three around Skye, one near Lewis, one in the Firth of Clyde and another in the North Channel off Galloway. Two more were in unspecified places &#8220;west of Scotland&#8221;. Moreover, another accident in the Mediterranean in 2009 had gone unreported. Those incidents were revealed as a result of parliamentary questions by Angus Robertson MP, the SNP&#8217;s defence spokesperson.</p><p>On 16 December 2012, another newspaper report told of nuclear submarine HMS Vigilant, which had recently undergone a &#163;300 million overhaul, being disabled on the way home to the Clyde after test-firing a Trident missile in the Atlantic off the coast of Florida on 21 October. The incident was revealed by one of its crew members, who tweeted:</p><p>&#8220;Stuck in the USA for Xmas.&#8221;</p><p>In a PQ answered in July 1998, George Robertson&#8212;Lord Robertson of NATO&#8212;told Jeremy Corbyn that warheads on the Trident missiles would serve 25 to 30 years of the Trident force but that</p><p>&#8220;disposal costs will depend upon future plans for the use or disposal of fissile material from the warheads.&#8221; &#8212;[Official Report, House of Commons, 14 July 1998; Vol 316, c 167W.]</p><p>Irradiated materials such as those used in the fuel cores of the submarines are hazardous and very difficult to transport. Dounreay, Rosyth and Devonport send them to Sellafield for reprocessing, but low and intermediate-level material goes by road, rail and sea in a steady and dangerous stream. Although discharges into the sea are highly regulated, it all makes for a huge radioactive legacy.</p><p>On 22 October 2010, the nuclear submarine HMS Astute ran aground near Broadford in Skye for 10 hours, causing huge repair bills and raising concerns in Skye. Last November, the submarine was dubbed &#8220;slow, leaky, rusty&#8221;; according to a headline in The Guardian,</p><p>&#8220;Britain&#8217;s &#163;10bn submarine&#8221;</p><p>was</p><p>&#8220;beset by design flaws&#8221;.</p><p>However, last December, the former defence minister Sir Nicholas Harvey on behalf of the Liberal Democrats argued for a compromise on Trident, telling the Nuclear Education Trust that only two Trident submarines could be replaced or, indeed, that the Astute class could carry nuclear warheads.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687091", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Trident"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Not at this time.

That means that our Government must ensure that Scotland gets the best deal that it can from the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. The convergence criteria for an independent Scotland would allow us to spend more money on supporting those industries in this country. That is why our food policy would benefit from independence.</p><p>Obviously, sustainable economic growth has a contribution to make through exports, which are very welcome. They fund growth in the home market, which is the life-blood of how people live in Scotland. Healthy activity, healthy diets and food security all flow from a food policy in which we encourage the highest-quality produce.</p><p>I will dwell on a couple of problems. I am delighted that there will be a new Scottish food body that will be a key regulator in future. It is essential that it takes up where the splitting up of the Food Standards Agency south of the border leaves off. The new body will deliver the functions that are currently carried out by the UK-wide FSA on food and feed safety and standards, nutrition, food labelling, meat inspection policy, and operational delivery.</p><p>The horsemeat scandal has left us with a labelling problem. Scotland wants to feed strongly into how the EU covers labelling and sourcing. We should be aware that there are forms of labelling that are far too lax and that the horsemeat issue is a labelling scandal. There is also a question about how genetic modification has been partly accepted in the EU and the threat that it could be to the natural produce of Scotland&#8212;that must be taken on board.</p><p>I will make a couple of points about the importance of the development of food. Some of what I have just said was mentioned in a previous debate, but this was not. There are safe, conventional alternatives in the market to potatoes, corn, soya and many other products that can be grown around the world without our putting huge amounts of gold into the pockets of the biotech industries and reducing the range of products that are available for local farmers to grow. For example, the Sarvari Research Trust in Bangor in north Wales has Hungarian strains of potatoes that are non-GM and blight resistant, but because it does not have the money that Monsanto and the like have, it cannot get them to an industry level. Although gardeners benefit from those potatoes, it is not the case that we can all benefit through the supermarkets.</p><p>It is important that supermarkets are waking up to the problems that we face. Tesco had a two-page advert in The Observer on Sunday in which it talked about us counting our pennies, our questions of trust, the need for quality, and its wanting to change. However, it will not change until it has a clear policy to support the producers of excellent food and does not reject food that is the wrong shape. I am talking about food that is good to eat and should be widely available, but is not. We cannot blame the people who buy the food for being told by the supermarkets that the price delivers for them. That does not deliver the best.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686116", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I draw members&#8217; attention to my membership of Slow Food International, the Soil Association and the Scottish Crofting Federation.

We look forward to her getting heavily involved in that.</p><p>In my final minute and a half, I would like to dwell on procurement. In my area in the Highlands, we are seeing a major change in the approach to procurement. I point out to members who lodged amendments that most food businesses in the Highlands and Islands are small businesses. Most of Highlands and Islands Enterprise&#8217;s account-managed companies are food and drink companies, and most are small. Companies must collaborate if they are to sell at regional, national and international levels.</p><p>This week, the Highland Council is developing its policy in that regard.

I believe that the issue can be solved in a short while and I look forward to the minister helping us to understand it.</p><p>Some decrofting is good&#8212;for building houses for local needs, for example&#8212;but some can be bad. Part of the regulatory purpose of the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 was to try to ensure that croft land is used and that absenteeism and neglect are reduced. The Crofting Commission is embarked on that process just now.</p><p>The co-operation that existed in the past in crofting is being re-established. Common grazing committees used to work together and people helped each other with their harvests and so on, and the more formal aspects of co-operation are necessary in the context of producing basic foods and getting them processed and marketed. Highlands and Islands Enterprise needs to focus on that with its new resilience policy.</p><p>I commend to members the activities of Community Land Scotland, which has helped a huge number of people to make a success of crofting in communities where there are also people who are not crofters. They have taken over some crofting communities that were privately owned and some that were owned by the Scottish Government. I hope that other communities will look to follow their example, although it is notable that many of those communities are in the Western Isles and far fewer are on the mainland&#8212;in my constituency or elsewhere.</p><p>One issue that crofting needs to focus on is the ability to process cattle for beef. Austria has more than 4,000 abattoir facilities that are accepted by the European Union, while the Highlands and Islands have only about half a dozen. That must be redressed.</p><p>I, too, was at the launch of phase 2 of the crofting connections project in Plockton. It is welcome that the project has been extended to many more schools, because it will bring young people into the area.</p><p>I finish by commenting on two factors that the crofting commissioners are grappling with. The first is mapping. Mapping is required by the 2010 act in order that we know what resources are available. Where communities have undertaken the exercise, they have a better idea of what their resources are.</p><p>The second factor is the duty to report. I had a hand in the amendment to the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill on that. The matter has been taken up by &#8220;The Crofter&#8221; in the form of a report from the grazings committee about the health of the community. The assessors have looked at the matter, and what has come out is an approach that should not be threatening and with which people should feel comfortable. Susan Walker, the convener of the Crofting Commission, said:</p><p>&#8220;With this approach, there is an opportunity for us to work together to gather the information we need to enable us to raise the profile of crofting with ministers and the Scottish Parliament and to present a clear picture of the state of crofting&#8212;its value and contribution to life in Scotland and the threats and problems it faces.&#8221;</p><p>I fully back that approach and I believe that crofters around the country see the positive message in it. I hope that the attempts by other people to describe the duty as &#8220;snooping on neighbours&#8221; will end and that that positive attitude to crofting will be reflected by many more people.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Jean Urquhart for securing the debate on the role of crofting in the Highlands and Islands.

The committee whole-heartedly backs the intention to improve the transparency and accountability of both sectors while minimising bureaucracy.</p><p>During the stage 1 process, the Scottish Government announced that the bill will be a first step in reforming wild fisheries management in Scotland. The committee will closely monitor that process, which should build on the aquaculture and wild fisheries legislation that was passed only a few years ago.</p><p>Turning to specifics, the committee supports most of the bill&#8217;s aquaculture provisions, such as those that will place farm agreements and statements on a statutory footing. We support the taking of samples from any fish farm where that is necessary to determine where an escape of fish originated, because preventing escapes is essential. We call on the Scottish Government to consider other methods for tracing escaped fish ahead of stage 2.</p><p>The wellboats that transport and treat farmed fish must be tightly defined in law, as retrofitting boats to meet new standards could prove costly. We would like to see provisions included in the bill that would make that commercially viable. However, having wellboats built and retrofitted in Scotland will happen only if the Scottish Government works directly with the Norwegian Government to develop common standards.</p><p>We back the provisions on defining species that are commercially damaging to fish farms. However, we ask the Government to examine the origins of such species rather than just their presence on or near to farms.</p><p>Much of the debate focused on sea lice, which is an issue that is currently not covered by the bill. Sea lice can infect wild and farmed fish, but they can spread quickly on fish farms, with effects on wild stocks. We call on the Government to look closely at that issue, as other members will mention in more detail later in the debate. Fish farms currently collect data on the numbers of sea lice. After considering the issue carefully, we agreed that we wish to see data collated and published for each farm management agreement. The committee will continue to consider that issue as the bill proceeds. However, the important point is that the bill ensures that data are available to scientists and researchers to manage sea lice outbreaks.</p><p>Seals predate on fish farms and can damage nets, which leads to escapes. The industry is working hard to address that issue. Currently, a number of seals are being shot on fish farms. The committee welcomed alternative methods of predator control, such as the development of audio devices that cause no damage to seals or other marine animals.</p><p>On wild fisheries, we were encouraged to learn that, against a backdrop of long-term decline, the number of salmon coming back to our rivers is stabilising. We need to build on that. Unfortunately, in many areas the number of sea trout has declined sharply for various reasons.</p><p>The bill addresses the governance and management of district salmon fisheries boards, which I hope will improve the accountability and transparency of their activities. The complaints procedures outlined in the bill are appropriate and proportionate, as are the proposals to ensure that board members declare financial interests.</p><p>We support the introduction of a carcass tagging scheme in which tags are individually numbered. As the minister mentioned, that will be consulted on.</p><p>Another hot topic was salmon netting at the mouths of our rivers, which has been declining in Scotland for some time. The small salmon-netting community sought to amend the bill to protect their livelihood.</p><p>We spent an afternoon at a salmon-netting station, and we talked to all who worked there and other netsmen who had journeyed from Strathy in my constituency. They argued for the management of salmon netting to be removed from district salmon fisheries boards and placed with the Scottish Government&#8217;s inshore fisheries group. They also wanted an end to the close times that require the removal of their equipment on weekends. They would prefer a more flexible days-at-sea regime. Netsmen face challenging conditions, but a days-at-sea regime would not be appropriate. However, more transparent conflict resolution in district salmon fisheries boards is needed.</p><p>The committee supported the sea fisheries part of the bill, which is not controversial. Illegal cockle fishing in the Solway was discussed&#8212;no doubt my colleague Alex Fergusson, MSP for Galloway and West Dumfries, will talk about that in greater detail. The Scottish Government indicated that that issue would be pursued by an amendment to the bill to assist the police and fiscals in detaining and prosecuting offenders. Alas, amendments alone will not end illegal shellfish harvesting&#8212;which goes beyond cockles&#8212;and we call on the Government and its partners to develop practical and workable proposals to tackle the problem.</p><p>We approved proposals for charging and fixed-penalty notices. We welcome the Government&#8217;s clarification that it will not introduce a rod licensing scheme, although anglers could have a role to play in assisting investment in wild fisheries management. Fixed-penalty notices can streamline legal processes, and we want the Government to publish statistics on their use for marine offences.</p><p>With some amendment, the bill will enhance aquaculture and wild fisheries to develop sustainably.

I am delighted to speak in the biodiversity debate on the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee&#8217;s behalf, because we wish to set up a discussion ahead of the Government&#8217;s response to the recent consultation.</p><p>The term &#8220;biodiversity&#8221; describes the variety of all life on earth and all the places where it is found. It was coined in 1985, but it became more widely used when the United Kingdom Government signed up to the Convention on Biological Diversity at the earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. That kick-started the biodiversity process that led to Scottish Government plans and local plans such as those from Highland Council, which covers the area that I represent and whose biodiversity action plan has been developed since 2002.</p><p>In its 2010 biodiversity check-up, Scottish Natural Heritage reported that biodiversity</p><p>&#8220;is the variety of life. The spectacular and varied wildlife within our iconic landscapes, coastal areas and seas is fundamental to the livelihood and quality of life of people in Scotland ... A resilient and diverse natural environment is the essential foundation for a greener, more robust, healthier, wealthier Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s response to its consultation on the 2020 challenge for Scotland&#8217;s biodiversity is about to be published. It is set against a backdrop of worldwide failure to stem biodiversity decline. In 2010, SNH said:</p><p>&#8220;Scotland has played an active part in stemming biodiversity loss, both with the rest of the UK and in its own right. A 25-year framework for action commenced in 2004 with the publication of Scotland&#8217;s Biodiversity Strategy. It recognises both the urgency of the task&#8221;</p><p>and many other issues.</p><p>What do we say to those who claim that we are failing to meet our targets? Are we worse or better than our neighbours? Is Scotland doing the best that it can? Do we have examples that we can offer other nations in our response? Can a small nation make a big difference?</p><p>Reviews show that, between 2005 and 2008, the percentage of priority habitats that were declining was unchanged at 34 per cent, while the percentage of habitats that were stable or increasing rose from 36 to 45 per cent. That means that we have a balance of problems to discuss.</p><p>Between 1998 and 2007, in lowland agricultural systems, which cover 28 per cent of Scotland, the amount of arable and horticultural land declined by 13 per cent, improved grass areas expanded by 9 per cent and the length of hedges, walls and fences decreased by 8 per cent. In our uplands and moors, which cover 55 per cent of Scotland, acid grassland expanded by 8 per cent.</p><p>The European Union&#8212;and us as part of it&#8212;undertook to stem the decline in biodiversity by 2010 but has failed to do that because of far worse figures than some of those that I have given. A more realistic target for 2020 has now been set.</p><p>I will discuss large-scale approaches to link land managers and local bodies in strengthening biodiversity. The Coigach and Assynt living landscape project, which was launched in 2011, is setting out to measure and improve biodiversity and human involvement to make that area far more sustainable in this climate change era. Twenty years ago, local ecologist Bernard Planterose recognised that reafforestation, beyond conservation, embraced wildlife conservation and the various present-day land uses, as well as future resettlement of the land and expansion of the productive natural resource base. As such, he said that it would exhibit ecological, economic and political strands.</p><p>As I said when the Coigach and Assynt living landscape project was launched:</p><p>&#8220;Today, we value trees and people, jobs and peatland rewetting, local energy production and biodiversity even more&#8221;</p><p>than we did 20 years ago. I continued:</p><p>&#8220;I am delighted that a measurable project with a 50-year time span has been set up in Coigach and Assynt&#8221;,</p><p>which are in my constituency,</p><p>&#8220;so as to set an example across the country. It fits the thrust of Scottish Government policy and is a practical way to link the environment and the people who live there ... to plan a brighter future.&#8212;[Official Report, 22 June 2011; c 916.]</p><p>Biological outcomes will be measured, clearly defined roles and objectives will be developed, and responsibilities will be taken.</p><p>A similar approach is in hand for our peatlands, which are of huge importance. Scotland is the world stronghold for the Atlantic blanket bogs, and our lowland raised bogs are a European priority. From the flows in Caithness and Sutherland right down to Galloway and the central belt, we have a wealth of peatland habitats, and Scotland has several showcase peatland restoration projects, such as those at Forsinard and Sutherland. Conservation management involves wildlife charities such as RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage, the University of the Highlands and Islands&#8217;s Thurso-based environmental research institute, as well as the Forestry Commission and the wind farm industry.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s deepest peats store around 10 times the amount of carbon that is stored in the whole of the UK&#8217;s forest biomass&#8212;they are that important. A loss of only 1 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s peat would equal the annual greenhouse gas emissions of around 57 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. Conversely, restoring damaged peatlands has great potential to help to reduce emissions and contribute to reaching Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets. We can already see various Government and non-governmental organisation partners working together on such projects.</p><p>To highlight the importance of that work, I have applied to be a wildlife champion for rusty bog-moss, or Sphagnum fuscum, which is found in the north-west Highlands. The loss of habitat there is due to the drainage of peat bogs. The Scottish Wildlife Trust is encouraging all members to become wildlife champions, and the national parks have a major role in that action. Other members will talk about that.</p><p>The common agricultural policy elements of high nature value farming have been under close scrutiny. In 2011, Scotland became the first country in the United Kingdom to assess the extent and broad distribution of high nature value farming, as required by the European Commission for its rural development programmes. According to the Scottish Agricultural College&#8212;which is now Scotland&#8217;s Rural College&#8212;in 2009, 40 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s utilised agricultural area was estimated to be under high nature value farming systems and, in 2010, 41 per cent of woodland areas in Scotland were considered to be under high nature value forestry systems. Any decline that has taken place since that period is likely to be associated with the retreat of livestock farming from Scotland&#8217;s hills. A more detailed commitment to high nature value farming and crofting must be built into the new common agricultural policy.</p><p>To turn to the sea, Marine Scotland&#8217;s efforts are an important new step. The Europe-authored marine protection areas initiatives, such as the marine protected area network, can be considered as positives for biodiversity in Scotland, but they fall short of being effective mechanisms for biodiversity conservation. In a recent debate on new designations, a headline in the Press and Journal said that scientific data could be used to restrict catches in conservation areas. Science is indeed attempting to ensure that there are sustainable fish stocks and habitats around Scotland. We must go with good science.</p><p>A frustrated constituent of mine has suggested much more draconian measures for fishing practices in our inshore waters, such as allowing zero discards&#8212;we agree with that; closing off inshore waters to dredging or trawling; fallowing fishing grounds in the same way as farmers fallow their fields; introducing compulsory square-top panels prior to the cod end in order to allow smaller species to escape; introducing 24/7 monitoring by global positioning systems and closed-circuit television for all vessels; and implementing severe penalties, including the destruction of vessels for persistent offenders.</p><p>The suggestions deserve serious consideration, but they are just one person&#8217;s ideas. When we make public policy, we must find a way to improve biodiversity in our seas and look at the issues seriously.</p><p>The removal of alien species, which is an on-going exercise, needs measurement and targeting. Do SNH and the Government have measures for the removal of the likes of Himalayan balsam? The Scottish Government, and the Executive before it, have been proactive.</p><p>With regard to bees, we have to look at the science, as I said earlier. The Green Party asked the committee to carry out an inquiry into neonicotinoids. We expect to deal with that issue in the biodiversity questioning that will follow the Government&#8217;s announcement of its conclusions. We will definitely have to consider the link between the loss of pollinators and the chemical treatment of crops. Just this week, European Food Safety Authority scientists identified a number of risks that are posed to bees by three neonicotinoid insecticides. The Scottish Government has to adopt the precautionary principle on the issue. It must study the transcripts of what the scientists have said; ensure that the industry&#8217;s risk assessment processes are more transparent; move towards the smarter use of insecticides; and look for ways to increase the number of insect pollinators and predators of pests across the agricultural landscape.</p><p>Everyone is trying in different ways to do good by the environment. I mentioned the Highland biodiversity strategy. A recent discussion in Highland Council identified that, although stopping cutting the grass close to the verges of some Highland roads is a way of increasing wildlife, it encourages birds to nest closer to roads, with the unintended consequence that their young are squashed. The council has had to rethink that. That is the kind of issue that crops up.</p><p>In the history of biodiversity, there are champions throughout this country and in many other countries. I went back to Frank Fraser Darling, who in 1946 wrote the book &#8220;Natural History in the Highlands and Islands&#8221;, which identified some of the things that we are trying to do today. For example, he said:</p><p>&#8220;We are apt to view with pleasure a rugged Highland landscape and think that we are here away from the works of the mind and hand of man, that here is wild nature. But more often than not we are looking at a man-made desert&#8221;.</p><p>He sees man as</p><p>&#8220;an indigenous animal in the countryside&#8221;,</p><p>along with the rest of nature. He goes on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Forestry, national parks and crofting agriculture have been mentioned as important factors in the existence of wild life in the Highlands. Hydro-electric power schemes might well be added. At the moment all these interests are separate, going their own way in their own way&#8221;.</p><p>He continues:</p><p>&#8220;National parks alone will not preserve wild life, nor even the plain establishment of special nature reserves for particular species and habitats. Some co-ordination is needed as well.&#8221;</p><p>Those words from 1946 are absolutely pertinent today.</p><p>The lessons for us are that, to achieve biodiversity targets, we need a quantified, detailed and joined-up biodiversity strategy and not just the existing work of NGOs, but work that is led by Government. Especially in this year of natural Scotland, it is vital that everyone in Scotland, particularly the younger generation&#8212;such as the children who are in the public gallery&#8212;are made aware of and experience at first hand the outstanding natural wealth of the country and its value in a climate change era.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes that the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee will be examining the analysis of the responses to the Scottish Government&#8217;s consultation on the 2020 Challenge for Scotland&#8217;s Biodiversity as the government looks to update its current biodiversity strategy against a backdrop of a global failure to meet biodiversity targets set for 2010, the revised target to halt biodiversity loss by 2020 and the related Aichi targets.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681867", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Biodiversity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Okay&#8212;this is biodiversity, part 2.

Under the SNP Government, we have worked within the national performance framework&#8212;NPF&#8212;process, which did not exist before. Partly, that has drawn attention from critics. In its report, the Finance Committee said&#8212;as the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee has said&#8212;that the Government</p><p>&#8220;was unable to provide systematic evidence of linking funding options back to the outcomes&#8221;</p><p>in the national performance framework. A new way of operating takes time to develop. However, we are beginning to get that link-up, which is an improvement, so we thank the Finance Committee for looking at issues in that fashion.</p><p>The Scottish Government needs to emphasise the consistency of references to the NPF and we will try to hold the Government to that. I hope that each committee will look at the areas to which the NPF refers&#8212;and it refers to all areas&#8212;and use that as a measure of progress. That is a theoretical matter, but it is becoming a practical matter of having better assessment of what is going on.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee took seriously the focus of our deliberations on sustainable development. The word &#8220;sustainable&#8221; in relation to development is important. To reassure Malcolm Chisholm, I am glad that cycling infrastructure will receive &#163;3.9&#160;million from the extra spending as a result of the autumn statement&#8212;every little helps. It would be nice for all active travel to have 10 per cent of the transport budget, but individuals must be encouraged to take part in activities such as walking; such behavioural change must be brought to the process. The budget can recognise a spend by the Government, but people must respond if we are to make the country healthier and ensure that we travel more carefully.</p><p>I feel strongly about one issue that is in the Finance Committee&#8217;s report and which various committees have mentioned: broadband. I am glad that, in his introduction to the debate, Kenny Gibson pointed out that very-high-speed broadband is excellent for downloading movies, but I have not found it difficult to watch the iPlayer at a speed of 2MB or 4MB.</p><p>If people in my constituency, in the north of Scotland, had 2MB or 4MB regularly, they would be able to do business and have the way of life that would allow them to participate in and improve the sustainable economic development that we are keen to have. That is not the dash for high-speed broadband that is big news for people in the cities. The situation is not good enough, which is why I am glad that Highlands and Islands Enterprise and other groups&#8212;with the help of European, British and Scottish Government money&#8212;will press forward with the broadband case.</p><p>It is essential that we get in place as early as possible the systems that will work in the most out-of-the-way places, because there is no way that we can lay fibre to the most remote communities. That is why improved broadband via satellite and so on, which is becoming a way forward, must be funded, because the British Telecoms of this world and other providers are only looking for a market. Because there are so few people in those areas, they will not provide a service, so we must back such development with public money. If I want to see a priority, it is an increase in that area.</p><p>The third point to concentrate on from the RACCE committee perspective is the climate challenge fund and climate change issues. I am delighted to have heard from the environment minister that the Government has agreed to our suggestion that the climate challenge fund, which has been so successful for many different communities, should have targets that allow the people who take up the fund to then create a commercial activity beyond it. That is a step forward and I am delighted that that part of the Finance Committee report has already been delivered.</p><p>However, I am not entirely convinced that every committee has taken mainstreaming the whole issue of climate change seriously. Last year, we asked each committee that was making reports to the Finance Committee to come up with means whereby they would assess whether the climate change obligations of the whole of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 were being met.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We should look at how the way in which we make budgets has changed over the years.

I have strong concerns that the continued discrimination against Scottish marine renewables could blight their development in a United Kingdom regulatory system that is unfit for purpose.</p><p>The UK regulator, Ofgem, stresses that an improved ICPR&#8212;investment cost-related pricing scheme&#8212;should reflect the costs that are imposed when transmitting electricity from a location where it is produced to where it is consumed, because the cost of building and maintaining the network must be met by the generator or the consumer.</p><p>Ofgem&#8217;s project transmit sets not charges but the methodology. However, I take issue with its approach on several grounds. It could lead to the Pentland Firth inner sound MeyGen tidal project, on the coast of Caithness in my constituency, which is aimed at producing 500MW, bearing an estimated &#163;8.3 million annual hook-up charge in 2020. Another local charge, in addition to the main grid charge, would affect the Orkney waters schemes across the Pentland Firth.</p><p>That contrasts with the annual subsidy of about &#163;2 million-plus that would apply if such projects were commissioned in the waters off south-west England, as the long-mooted Severn barrage would be. That is because Ofgem favours, through the locational charges, schemes that are closer to consumers.</p><p>Nuclear-generated power is imported from France to southern England via the interconnector at no charge. No locational charge is added in the French electricity system so, wherever electricity is produced in France, it costs the same price to export.</p><p>Ofgem has not proposed a fundamental change from the Thatcherite model that favoured large thermal power stations that are close to large populations. It is clear that it does not have the whole UK in mind. That approach excludes the areas with the most wind, the strongest tides and the biggest waves&#8212;the north of Scotland and our northern isles and Western Isles.</p><p>The signals from the UK Government are not aimed at recognising the north&#8217;s infinite clean energy potential. It is significant that David Cameron vetoed the appointment of David Kennedy&#8212;the UK Committee on Climate Change&#8217;s chief executive&#8212;as permanent secretary at the Department of Energy and Climate Change because David Kennedy had questioned the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8217;s dash for gas and said that green energy would be cheaper over time.</p><p>The Financial Times of 13 December quoted David Kennedy as saying that UK Committee on Climate Change&#8217;s research revealed that household bills could be as much as &#163;600 higher per annum in coming decades. He said that promoting the use of green energy</p><p>&#8220;is like taking out an insurance policy&#8212;you pay &#163;100 now to avoid having to pay &#163;600 later&#8221;.</p><p>Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the announcement in November of incoming renewables jobs with Areva as &#8220;brilliant for Scotland&#8221;. In The Press and Journal of 20 November, he said:</p><p>&#8220;I am determined that Britain competes and thrives in the global race and this shows that the UK remains an attractive place for foreign investment.</p><p>Growth of the renewable energy sector&#8221;</p><p>is &#8220;good for our economy&#8221;.</p><p>That stands in contrast to his rejection of the UK Committee on Climate Change&#8217;s concerns that the dash for gas takes us in the wrong direction.</p><p>The bottom line is that the UK Government has not sent Ofgem strong signals to set up a fair system of transmission charging&#8212;hence the need for two committees to be set up to work on ways to cut costs for far-north developers. Last July, an industry-led CUSC&#8212;connection and use of system code&#8212;group was set up to seek a formula to stabilise charges at current levels on the north mainland and to maintain them at about &#163;20 per kilowatt in 2020 after &#163;10 billion of grid investment, while securing the maximum possible cost-reflective reductions for the islands.</p><p>Although some of the islands will immediately become part of the main interconnected transmission system, they were deliberately excluded from the volume-based charge proposal that Ofgem made. We await the solution, which might cut access costs by 10 per cent. However, that is not enough to make some schemes economically viable.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680478", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Renewables (Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members who signed the motion in order that the debate could take place.

I need point no further than the fast track for conventional and shale gas extraction and use to replace ageing nuclear and coal power stations in England, which is a signal to investors that the Tory-Lib Dem coalition favours short-term and inefficient gas-fired, carbon-emitting electricity production as opposed to long-term, clean, green and sustainable alternatives.

The argument on that has taken place in the coalition Government in the past year and put back the UK targets to a later date.</p><p>Those things affect us hugely, and we must get over them, because the huge potential of cutting-edge tidal, offshore wind and wave power development needs the boost of steady backing from the Government. The uncertainty stems from London decisions; the clarity of purpose in creating a low-carbon economy is rooted in Holyrood.</p><p>Those things cannot be ignored in the debate.

We cannot really change the date, although St Columba&#8217;s day on 9 June is slightly more attractive time at which to celebrate. However, let us brighten up the day.</p><p>A friend of mine who is teaching English as a foreign language in Paris said to me yesterday in an e-mail that she has found that all the students who are learning English with her have an incredible appetite for Scottish culture. We should recognise that international view on St Andrew&#8217;s day. That shows that, although people are awakened to the possibilities of using the universal language of English, they see Scottish culture through and beyond that prism.</p><p>I will discuss our national day in terms of identities. I was interested to note that, earlier this month, Mike Russell gave a lecture in the Neil Gunn centre. I did not manage to attend it, but its theme was &#8220;The Writer in a Time of Change: Gunn, Walsh and the Process of Independence&#8221;. Mike Russell said that he shared Neil Gunn&#8217;s belief that internationalism is richer when nationalisms come together. The writer of a review of the lecture said:</p><p>&#8220;As an SNP politician, it would have been easy for Mr Russell to distort this interest of Neil Gunn&#8217;s to his contemporary advantage. Instead, he stuck to his brief, indicating that Gunn&#8217;s political perspective was as an internationalist as much as a nationalist.&#8221;</p><p>That is a great thing for us to bear in mind today. We should recognise and celebrate how Scotland is seen around the world and how people here recognise what they see.</p><p>In a debate at the weekend, Alex Salmond talked about the fact that people are entitled to have as many layers of identity as they wish. That is another way of saying that we are celebrating a identity now and let us not mistake other identities with it at the moment. Alex Salmond was responding to Bill Clinton, who had said that what we have in common matters more. Yes, it matters&#8212;but if people are not themselves, how can they contribute to that &#8220;more&#8221;? Today, we are discussing what matters.</p><p>On reasons to celebrate, we also have reasons to remember with gratitude some of the people who cannot celebrate with us now. There is David Morrison, who was a librarian in Wick. He went up there from Glasgow and was the author of the Scotia Review. He was a great facilitator of arts activities and he died a few months ago. Among the musicians, Ian Hardie and Derek Hoy will not be playing today, nor will the great Michael Marra.</p><p>We must celebrate the fact that our music in particular attracts people to Scotland. The new year celebrations are part of the attraction, but St Andrew&#8217;s day allows us to think why our music has become even more popular. I thank Donald Shaw, who is the director of the Celtic Connections festival, which is part of our winter festival, for enlightening us. He said:</p><p>&#8220;Partly that is about the changing face of the way the music has been presented. Swapping white heather and kilts for Doc Martens and T-shirts has helped, as has the way the music itself has loosened some of its shackles. Celtic Connections has been at the heart of that process.&#8221;</p><p>Scottish music today is cool. It has always been cool, but it is being heard in many more places where people can judge it against everyone else&#8217;s music. What Donald Shaw said means that the many people who want to celebrate St Andrew&#8217;s day throughout our country will do so through poetry and song. I hope to contribute to that, myself. When we talk about the outlook for Scots on St Andrew&#8217;s day, we should recognise that people from five continents come to play in this country at Celtic Connections. They are preparing to do so now.</p><p>Scots are seen around the world as a welcoming people. I think that the winter is not off-putting. St Andrew&#8217;s day is a national day and is worth giving a lot more weight to, and I certainly think that people in here singing traditional music of whatever kind they like would be one of the best things that could happen. I see that today&#8217;s Daily Record talks about people who say how they feel much healthier by singing. That was, of course, included in the motion that I lodged on the Scotland sings project, which runs from St Andrew&#8217;s day to 2 December. That project considers that singing is good for people and that it should make them smile. I hope that St Andrew&#8217;s day makes us smile and that I can personally add to the contribution that allows us to feel good about ourselves in this country.</p><p>If the Parliament does not feel that, we can get bogged down in analyses that might look at such things through the prism of the UK. There is not British literature or British traditional music; there is Scottish literature and Scottish music. Those are means by which we will celebrate our national day, and I hope that even the Tories will recognise that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22678093", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: St Andrew&#8217;s Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The idea behind celebrating St Andrew&#8217;s day on 30 November was partly handed down to us by the old church, and we are stumped with that, in a way.

Farmers in such areas know that, in the current market, they must have support. It would be easy to say that, in some utopia, there was no need for such things to happen but, as Mr Lochhead said, farmers in</p><p>&#8220;remote and disadvantaged areas of Scotland already suffered from the inability of the free market to deliver which was why they needed support.&#8221;</p><p>I maintain that position, and the Parliament must maintain it.</p><p>The problem requires coupled payments, for example. How will we deal with the beef suckler herd unless we have coupled payments? The UK Government does not like that one bit. It wants to abolish pillar 1 support, but if we want an approach that supports our farming and its high-quality produce, such things must be in place.</p><p>I will move on to another issue that is a bit of a challenge. As a new CAP is coming along, we must approach wider areas in which people have not only rights to support, but responsibilities. I refer to biodiversity and climate change, for example, which the cabinet secretary has talked about. In preparation for Rio+20, the document &#8220;A Flourishing Scotland&#8221;, which is on a sustainable Scotland, noted:</p><p>&#8220;As the 2010 target to halt the loss of biodiversity in Scotland was not met, more effort and investment is now required to turn around continuing declines in nature. Key threats to biodiversity including habitat loss, intensification of land use, invasive species, diffuse pollution and marine ecosystem degradation continue largely unabated.&#8221;</p><p>Farmers and crofters have a major part to play in that process, and we must ensure that, when we give them pillar 1 and 2 support, we find appropriate ways, through greening, for them to be able to contribute to it. It has been pointed out that our soils are particularly lighter in the north. We have a whole area in which it is possible to make a big impact. We need to do that in agriculture, as agricultural emissions are yet to be fully tackled.</p><p>Obviously, I do not have much time to talk about the whole subject matter. However, the SRDP, which we are dealing with, needs a carryover to ensure that it is continuous. We agree on that. The SRDP will also contribute to greening. We have heard from the forestry industry about its wish for more sensible and simpler access to funds, and we have heard about the group that has been looking at the way forward for forestry. Some land from agriculture needs to pass over into forestry. We must find a way to do that so that farmers can be a part of the process. A change of 2 per cent is being talked about and must be negotiated. The SRDP, in supporting forestry and our peatland opportunities, for example, has to be made simpler and more direct. Indeed, the computer systems that govern those things must be sorted out.</p><p>Last week, I heard about the challenge fund that helps the food and drink industry and tourism. The north Highland challenge fund is an excellent example. Through building on fantastic local produce, we can sell it in a wider market. Richard Lochhead announced that fund in my constituency, and I welcome the opportunities that it creates for producers.</p><p>I also welcome the fact that Mr Armitage of Caithness Free Range Eggs near Wick said that the SRDP helped him to get off the ground. We hope that future SRDPs and the CAP can help such innovative businesses to get moving as well.</p><p>I support the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673620", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are talking about areas of natural constraint that we have identified as places that require support.

We need to have that kind of investment in the renewable energy industries now. For example, Moray Offshore Renewables, which proposes to build the largest offshore wind farm in these islands in the Moray Firth, has formed a partnership with Repsol and Energias de Portugal, from Spain and Portugal respectively, in order to get enough cash to deal with the project, because, given the constraints that are on the Scottish Government and the state of the financial markets in London, no one else was prepared to put up the money that was required. I suggest that we need to have a much more beefy form of banking to support energy.</p><p>I noticed today that Vince Cable is talking about speeding up investment in business by circumventing the big four banks. Would the green investment bank not be one of the entities that ought to be taking up that challenge right now?</p><p>Of course, we can get small local banks going. There are fantastic credit unions in the Highlands and Islands and elsewhere, but they provide only very small loans. We need big banks to deal with the huge projects that are required.</p><p>With regard to the energy projects that have been making progress, the Global Energy Group has just completed a &#163;25 million refurbishment project on the GSF Galaxy 1 rig in Nigg, in my constituency. That kind of process&#8212;&#163;25 million-worth of investment over a few months, employing 500 people&#8212;will continue as the North Sea effort increases, and our areas in the north of Scotland are delivering in that regard. In renewables, MeyGen&#8217;s major 400MW tidal project in the Pentland Firth is at the planning stage with Marine Scotland.</p><p>Such projects are examples of progress that has already been made, and there are many more in the pipeline. However, the companies involved must be helped by knowing where the investment will come from.</p><p>There are constraints on energy projects. For example, in his column on 3 September, Jeremy Cresswell, the energy editor of The Press and Journal, referred to</p><p>&#8220;the Ministry of Defence which, UK-wide, is holding a great many wind projects to ransom. A host of wind projects in the north-east are under threat because of MoD&#8217;s elderly Buchan radar&#8221;.</p><p>Indeed, it looks as though the Ministry of Defence may oppose the Moray Firth scheme as well.</p><p>Jeremy Cresswell continued:</p><p>&#8220;Given the London and Holyrood commitments to renewable energy, MoD must be made to understand that blocking wind projects is not acceptable. There needs to be a concerted, systematic effort to modify defence radar systems to cope with wind&#8221;</p><p>farms.</p><p>&#8220;MoD must stop holding wind developers to ransom by getting them to stump up for radar patches here, another there ... Defence is a strategic issue. But so too is sustainable energy.

I will focus on greening Scotland, which is contained in the Government&#8217;s programme.</p><p>The common agricultural policy, which is making its way through Europe at the moment, is one of the biggest pieces of domestic legislation to be tackled this year. It is split into two pillars, the first of which brings &#163;0.5 billion into the pockets of Scottish farmers to produce the quality food that has given us such a strong reputation around the world.</p><p>The CAP is decided by co-decision between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. It is important that we have a voice at the top table. We need to have someone there as well as our members of the European Parliament when the European Parliament looks at the 7,000 amendments that it needs to vote on before the end of November in order to sift them to ensure that Scotland&#8217;s interests are looked after.</p><p>I remind members that Richard Lochhead, the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, told the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee on 14 March 2012 that if we were a European Union member state in our own right, the proposed convergence criteria would deliver anything between &#8364;170 million and &#8364;190 million a year in Scotland, which would be a substantial boost and give us many more options for targeting support within Scotland. The less favoured areas, which make up 85 per cent of Scottish farming, would stand to benefit if we were a member state because the convergence criteria would give us an opportunity to target support.</p><p>On the common fisheries policy, Scottish ministers would battle more strongly to gain greater regionalisation, given that Westminster&#8217;s priorities often clash with ours. Again, a Scottish seat at the top table would foster our interests directly.</p><p>In the past year, because of the Scotland Bill, Scottish control of the Crown Estate Commission has been barred by the Tory-Liberal Westminster coalition. I believe that until we in this Parliament have discussed controlling the commission here and agreed by majority vote to do so, as the Westminster Scottish Affairs Committee has suggested, we will not be able to control the marine area here in a constructive fashion. However, I hope that in the meantime the Scottish Government can look at ways to lift the burdens of Crown Estate Commission taxes on trust ports and coastal local authorities and that such work should proceed ahead of gaining more powers.</p><p>The leader of the Opposition mentioned that we had a long-standing, honourable record as far as land reform is concerned. That is so, but the land reform review group, which the Scottish Government set up in July under the chairpersonship of Dr Alison Elliot, will ensure that we not only develop new ideas to improve the current legislation and generate more innovative proposals, but ensure that they come about.</p><p>When the leader of the Opposition visited Lewis, she should have visited the Pairc estate, where the residents are trying to get control of the land in a hostile bid under the current legislation. That is complex and difficult, which is why the legislation must be reformed. That is one key part of land reform that will touch all parts of Scotland and enable more people in rural and urban Scotland to have a stake in the ownership, governance, management and use of our land. I believe that it is essential to a confident Scotland that land reform succeeds. We look for support for that from across the Parliament.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, which I convene, received several pieces of anonymous evidence when we considered the Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill. As a result, we have started to look at various parts of Scotland to find out about problems that tenant farmers face. We welcome the fact that the industry-led tenant farming forum&#8212;the industry body that has developed seven individual workstreams&#8212;will report by December 2013 on issues such as data collection, equipment repairs and renewals, holding investment, waygo compensation, diversification, succession and assignation, all of which are critical to a secure tenant farming sector.</p><p>One issue that arose from a delegation that visited Bute, and which I have followed up, is about the conditions that act against that security. Having surveyed tenant farmers&#8217; houses on several islands and on the mainland, I have found many of them to be in a very poor state of repair. I can only echo Dr Brenda Boardman&#8217;s comments in an article on fuel poverty in yesterday&#8217;s The Herald newspaper that property owners should foot the bill for wind and watertight buildings. She said:</p><p>&#8220;Landlords have to be responsible. They are the key.&#8221;</p><p>That is as much a matter for landlords who have tenant farmers as it is for those who rent houses in cities.</p><p>We are to have an aquaculture bill, which we believe will be introduced in late autumn.</p><p>On the natural environment, our food producers and land users can have confidence that the Scottish Government is ambitious for Scotland, but we must ensure that all parts of Scotland help with our emission reduction. At present, a good deal more help is necessary from our transport and residential sectors. The rewetting of peatlands could reduce carbon emissions by large amounts.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671078", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Government&#8217;s programme contains both new bills and on-going work to improve life in Scotland.

It is a vital aspect of a modern nation&#8217;s ability to know who owns what and whether ownership can be conferred on people who have for many years been virtual owners. Making actual owners under the legislation is quite an important development.</p><p>I say that because we have been discussing the issue for a long time. In the excellent Scottish Parliament information centre briefing, Sarah Harvie-Clark noted that, under Lord Guthrie, the Scottish leases committee did a search in the register of sasines for the period 1905 to 1951, the results of which disclosed 13,151 such leases, almost 9,000 of which were found to have more than 100 years still to run. That shows for how long there has been concern about long leases. Indeed, I recall debates on Scottish National Party policy formation in the 1970s and conference resolutions by the late Willie MacRae and others that recognised that people have suffered from not being able to borrow on the basis of their assets. The SNP has recognised the need to change that. Vetoes from the House of Lords and others, and lack of time in London, mean that it is only the establishment of the Scottish Parliament that has allowed us to tackle any of those problems.</p><p>A comprehensive approach to the problem has thrown up the difficulties of having a register that matches our aspirations. After stage 2 of the bill, we received responses from the minister about books of council and session, which refer to very old arrangements for the ownership and leasing of land, and that made us realise how much had to be modernised and how complex the process would be.</p><p>Previous Governments have tried to find out who owns what in the country. In 1872 and then in 1910, a survey was conducted throughout the United Kingdom of who owned what. That was with a view to land value taxation, which the then Government was considering.</p><p>We need to think about two aspects of who owns what. The cost of bringing the land register up to date is a matter of concern, but it is worth considering the fact that people were compelled to inform past Governments about what they owned. It would be worth our looking at some way of people providing us with the information without it being a cost to the public purse. That might be difficult, but we must consider it because we are not going to complete our knowledge without it.</p><p>Up to 9,000 householders will benefit most from the legislation, and I always welcome more people having a direct stake in the land of Scotland and the properties thereon. It improves their grasp of their own country. If the bill goes a little way towards taking that opportunity, I am delighted. It goes hand in hand with other legislation and I recognise that the proposed community empowerment and renewal bill will deal with the common good issue if people choose to raise it. In the meantime, I welcome the changes to the Long Leases (Scotland) Bill made by the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee and the Parliament, and I hope that it passes.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670649", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Long Leases (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the convener of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, which has dealt with the bill and amendments, I know that we have changed and improved an important bill to add to the modernisation of the law of property and land in Scotland.

I will explore the reasons why he has been neglected for decades and how his life is an inspiration for us today&#8212;indeed, he ranks as a great Scot in our long history.</p><p>On a monument that was erected at Dumbarton&#8212;now relocated to Gartmore&#8212;a year after his death in 1936 we can read the words:</p><p>&#8220;FAMOUS AUTHOR,</p><p>TRAVELLER AND HORSEMAN</p><p>PATRIOTIC SCOT</p><p>AND CITIZEN OF THE WORLD ...</p><p>HE WAS A MASTER OF LIFE &#8212;</p><p>A KING AMONG MEN.&#8221;</p><p>Born in London on 24 May 1852, Robert was the eldest child. His father was an army officer, his mother part Spanish and part Scots. He was aristocratic on all four sides, with long family connections to Finlaystone, Ardoch and Gartmore in the west of Scotland. His direct descent from King Robert II of Scotland via the defunct earldom of Mentieth gave him a better claim to the throne than Queen Victoria. His ancestors were radically minded lairds on the Lowland-Highland border, where their 10,000 rushy acres around Gartmore and the Lake of Mentieth produced little income and mounting debts.</p><p>As children, he and his brothers would ride ponies around the Gartmore policies in the summer. He disliked English public schooling, from experiences at Leamington Spa and Harrow. His family links to South America produced a bright boy who soon became fluent in Spanish. He received no classical university education, but he learned fencing and French at finishing school in Brussels. As an adolescent, he saw his father become practically insolvent and thoroughly insane from wounds received on army duty in Ireland.</p><p>Unsure of a career in the army or imperial service, Robert expressed the wish to ranch in Argentina, which turned into a lifelong love affair with the life on the pampas and the wild mixed-race gauchos&#8212;the South American cowboys. For seven years, on and off, he spent time cattle and horse trading while absorbing the atmosphere and the nature of the frontier and the young republics, from Argentina to Brazil&#8212;hence the sobriquet Don Roberto. He sympathised with the marginalised, the downtrodden and victims of progress, and he became the political champion of the gauchos, the Sioux indians and tribes across the globe in his extensive writings that began after six years in the imperial Parliament, which he dubbed &#8220;the Theatre Royal, Westminster&#8221;.</p><p>Robert eloped with a struggling actor whom he met in Paris&#8212;Gabriela de la Balmondi&#232;re&#8212;who was apparently a Chilean orphan. They loved to travel and she loved to write on mystical subjects. Their visits to Texas, Mexico and Spain ended only with her early death in 1906. He buried her on the isle of Inchmahome, where he, too, is interred.</p><p>The death of Robert&#8217;s father in 1883 brought managerial responsibilities at Gartmore and, in the next few years, an entry into active politics. Robert was finally elected as a Liberal MP for north-west Lanarkshire in 1886, when Lord Salisbury and the Tories won a six-year term. With wit and an outspoken style in the chamber, his campaigns championed the miners, crofters, the dock workers and the chain makers of Cradley Heath. He stood for home rule all round; he befriended Charles Stuart Parnell, without agreeing on economic policies; and he promoted Keir Hardie. The collaboration of Graham and Hardie helped to birth the Scottish Home Rule Association and the Scottish Labour Party in the late 1880s.</p><p>Robert&#8217;s forebears were radical Liberals, and he himself opposed aggressive foreign policies and the game laws. He was for Scots and Irish home rule, a graduated income tax, reform of the land laws, the abolition of primogeniture and entail, free education and local options on the sale of liquor. That placed him as a substantial landowner campaigning against landlordism. Indeed, he had to sell Gartmore in 1900.</p><p>He quickly drew members&#8217; attention at Westminster, where his speeches and suspensions became big news. He became the first socialist MP in a growing circle of varying degrees of fervour. For his part, he maintained a lifelong commitment to parliamentary democracy and the need for working people to be their own representatives. George Bernard Shaw captured his immortal phrase, &#8220;I never withdraw&#8221;, for his play &#8220;Arms and the Man&#8221;. That was Graham&#8217;s response to his second suspension from the house for protecting miners from predatory Tory legislation that would have damaged the miners in his constituency.</p><p>After failing to be re-elected in 1892, he began writing from early notes for his own amusement. He travelled and wrote many short stories and sketches, which included acerbic political comments in many periodicals. By 1900, he was seen by others as a writer&#8217;s writer. That trenchant and humane writing inspired many in his wide circle of literary friends, in particular Joseph Conrad, who wrote &#8220;Heart of Darkness&#8221; and &#8220;Nostromo&#8221;, both of which exposed the evils of imperialism and so-called progress in the Belgian Congo and in South America. Robert&#8217;s history of the Jesuits in Paraguay became the modern film &#8220;The Mission&#8221;, and his histories of South American dictators warned the world in the 1920s and 1930s against the rise of Hitler and Mussolini.</p><p>The Parliament should congratulate Alan MacGillivray and John C McIntyre on the publication in the past year, by Kennedy &amp; Boyd of Glasgow, of the collected stories and sketches of R B Cunninghame Graham in five volumes of one modern edition. Their four years of labour to present the works of one of Scotland&#8217;s finest writers will allow modern audiences to enjoy and assess Cunninghame Graham&#8217;s place in Scotland&#8217;s national literature.</p><p>The golden thread of his life deserves new understanding and analysis. Many of the causes of his lifelong campaigns ring a bell for us today, not least his determination in later life to help found the National Party of Scotland in 1928. He became the first president of the Scottish National Party in 1934. I hope that we share his concerns for the downtrodden and enjoy his descriptions of nature and the people of his native Mentieth, or of Morocco or the Argentine pampas&#8212;lands threatened by the hand of progress about which he was so sceptical. His writings should be known to all who value humanity and social justice.</p><p>The motion</p><p>&#8220;calls on the Parliament and Scottish Government to prepare appropriate celebrations in 2012 for the 160th anniversary of his birth.&#8221;</p><p>To help, I have secured, on top of the debate, a place in the festival of politics to further explore the adventurous life and the ideas of this famous Scot.</p><p>I hope that the Parliament can honour Don Roberto by etching one of his trenchant quotes on the wall outside. I modestly suggest, in these continued days of constitutional change, a phrase that he used in a rally at Stirling in 1930. He said:</p><p>&#8220;The enemies of Scottish Nationalism are not the English, for they were ever a great and generous folk, quick to respond when justice calls. Our real enemies are among us, born without imagination.&#8221;</p><p>Viva Cunninghame Graham.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669748", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: R B Cunninghame Graham"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is no easy task to summarise the adventurous life of Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham and explain why I believe that he deserves widespread recognition.

It looks as though many amendments will be submitted to those committees before the European Parliament takes a final position, which it will discuss with the Council. It is up to us to ensure that we influence that process, and the Scottish National Party MEPs will take part in many of the discussions.</p><p>The first issue that I want to cover is that of decentralisation.

That must be tested. It is important that we get a clear ruling in Europe about the possibility of our member state taking those actions on our behalf. Although it was useful of Jamie McGrigor&#8212;who is no longer in the chamber&#8212;to have pointed out that the UK has devolved some of the relevant powers to the devolved Administrations, it is important that the member state has the powers to act on our behalf and to co-operate on a regional basis. If that can be tested, decentralisation could work. That might move things further forward than would the proposals of the European Parliament and the Commission.</p><p>The need to tackle discards has been a massive issue, which, as we know, must be addressed extremely carefully in Scotland. Much of the Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall approach goes against the knowledge that we have of the mixed fishery that Scotland is involved in. We need a fishery-by-fishery approach to discards. If we have any say in such matters, that is the approach that we will take because, as WWF notes,</p><p>&#8220;This is where regionalisation will help&#8212;with stakeholders devising measures and regulations better tailored to the fisheries concerned.

However, as the evidence from stakeholders and the Scottish Government has demonstrated, there is still much work to be done to improve the law further and to address the recent trend of the decline in the number of agricultural tenancies in order to make more land available for rent and to encourage a greater number of new and younger entrants into farming.</p><p>The figures show a drop in the number of secure tenancies from a 2005 figure of 7,172 to a 2011 figure of 6,048. The numbers of short limited duration tenancies and limited duration tenancies increased in the same period. The fact that land is now being let for shorter lengths of time will be detrimental to farming in the long term, because tenants will not invest as they can if they have a longer lease. We will investigate the reasons for that further. When we take evidence on the ground, we may find that there are many farmers who wish to invest as tenants but who find certain barriers in place.</p><p>We should take into account the fact that tenant farming has now reached the point of having the European convention on human rights used to determine a case, as in Salvesen v Riddell. That expresses the right of people to enjoy their right to private property, but it also expresses the general interest to have land and other property used well. At the next stage in the process, we have to consider the general interest in Scotland to have more secure and sustainable farms of a tenanted and owned nature. Unless we are able to move to that position, through the application of the ECHR, that argument will be used against the development of farming in Scotland, as the case of Salvesen v Riddell shows. We await the outcome of the case in the Supreme Court, when the Lord Advocate takes it there next year.</p><p>That raises the issue that it takes a great deal of time to reach decisions. It has taken more than seven years to reach the point at which we have this modest bill. There are many things to be done, and I welcome the timetable that the cabinet secretary has laid out for rent reviews and suggest that, if we are going to enable tenants to move forward, the tenant farming forum must achieve answers far more quickly.</p><p>I mentioned the needs of young entrants into farming. There was some argument about whether 40 was a reasonable age for someone to be considered a new entrant, given that people are living longer. We think that new entrants could be older than that.</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee has just received a response to a submission that we made on the future of the common agricultural policy. Commissioner Dacian Ciolos wrote:</p><p>&#8220;The Commission is mindful of your concerns about new entrants and the 2011 eligibility rule. The legal proposal limits access to entitlements in 2014 to beneficiaries of the Single Payment Scheme or the Single Area Payment Scheme in respect of claim year 2011 to avoid potential negative distortions of the land markets. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that young farmers are a priority group of new entrants. That is why support during the early years is proposed through the young farmers&#8217; scheme and to allocate entitlements from the national reserve to this group as a priority. If Scotland considers that the allocation of entitlements to all new entrants is important in areas where there is a risk of land abandonment or in areas with specific disadvantages, it could consider using the national reserve.&#8221;</p><p>I very much welcome that debate being firmed up. At the moment, the offers of land that are made by landlords to tenants are often of a five-year nature&#8212;the short limited duration tenancy. I do not believe that new entrants can make a start in farming if that is the only option that they have.

The document is in two parts. The first covers celebrations and the second covers ambitions. The celebrations are important to remember because there has been progress since the Rio process began. For example, in the area of biodiversity, one of the noted celebrations in Scotland is the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, which</p><p>&#8220;introduced a biodiversity duty on all public bodies, a landmark duty that now needs to be translated into action on the ground to build on successful initiatives such as water environment restoration funds.&#8221;</p><p>Under the ambitions section, the document states:</p><p>&#8220;As the 2010 target to halt the loss of biodiversity in Scotland was not met, more effort and investment is now required to turn around continuing declines in nature.&#8221;</p><p>We see the realities in our country and, if we bring those realities to other people, it may help them with the decisions that they have to make.

The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee took account of the evidence that the previous session&#8217;s Justice Committee heard on a similar bill and focused on new aspects of the bill. I thank the previous Justice Committee for its work.</p><p>As well as considering new provisions, the committee heard evidence from witnesses on related policy issues to which the bill does not refer directly. We carefully considered common good and the status of Edinburgh&#8217;s Waverley market in the future, on which I will say more later.</p><p>The bill takes forward work of the Scottish Law Commission by seeking to convert ultra-long leases into ownership unless the tenant chooses to opt out, with compensation to the former landlord. The ultra-long leases in question are leases of more than 175 years that have more than 100 years left to run. Leases that are granted for such long periods are akin to ownership, so the bill will simply convert such leases to ownership. The Scottish Government estimates that there are about 9,000 ultra-long leases in Scotland, most of which are for 999 years, so few people will be directly affected. The committee agrees with that general principle of the bill, which will meet people&#8217;s needs.</p><p>As has been said, the bill is largely technical. I will describe some interesting issues that were raised with the committee.</p><p>The bill provides for various exemptions, which include making commercial leases exempt from conversion to ownership by having an annual rent cut-off point of &#163;100. Should the annual rent be varied, that would be taken into account in the commercial lease exemption provisions.</p><p>The rent payable is the rent that was set out in the original lease, but variations to the annual rent are not necessarily reflected in the original lease. As drafted, the exemption might not include all commercial leases, if variable rents are not captured correctly, so we welcome the commitment in the Government&#8217;s response to our stage 1 report to lodge an amendment on that at stage 2.</p><p>We considered whether leases for which a single payment, or grassum, was paid in addition to the annual rent would count as commercial leases and therefore be exempt from the bill; for example, a developer paid the City of Edinburgh District Council a lump sum of &#163;6.25&#160;million in 1989 for the Waverley market. We noted the conflicting evidence, but we came to no conclusion.</p><p>The committee considered the position of standard securities when long leases are converted to ownership. The bill allows lenders to collect moneys that relate to mortgages on leases once they have converted to ownership.</p><p>The number of questions about the potential loss of landlords&#8217; rights when leases convert to ownership is expected to be fairly low. The committee noted that sections 50 to 55 provide for additional payments on the basis of the loss of heritable interest and potential development value. There will be a role for the Lands Tribunal for Scotland to determine the amount that is to be paid to landlords.</p><p>The bill relates to the Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill, which is reaching stage 2 scrutiny in the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, as has been said. Concern was expressed that Registers of Scotland does not wish to carry out a specific exercise to update the land register to reflect the conversion of ultra-long leases to ownership under the Long Leases (Scotland) Bill. The committee believes that the land register must be updated, and it called on the Scottish Government to respond on that. I have raised the issue of registration in my speeches in the chamber on the Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill and the Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill. The need to dovetail those bills with this bill requires a more accurate picture of land ownership in Scotland. Thankfully, the Scottish Government has responded to the committee&#8217;s report by stating that both the Government and Registers of Scotland recognise the value to the Scottish economy of keeping the land register as up to date as possible. We welcome the Government&#8217;s assurance that it will lodge amendments at stage 2.</p><p>That brings me to the other issues that became major focuses of the committee&#8217;s work. The bill contains no specific provisions in relation to common good or on whether there should be an exemption for common good land. The committee acknowledges the extreme complexity of common good land law and the lack of robust information being held by councils. Although the numbers are small, such land is of significant importance to the public interest. We recommended that the Scottish Government work with local councils and other professionals to gather and maintain a correct register.</p><p>Should common good land be exempted? The committee was not persuaded and neither was the previous Justice Committee. We have acknowledged the legal and administrative complexities in that respect. We were strongly of the view that any financial compensation that would be received by local councils for long-lease conversion must be directed to their common good funds, so we welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s intention to write to local councils to tell them just that.</p><p>The most contentious part of our evidence taking was on the status and future of Edinburgh&#8217;s Waverley market, otherwise known as Princes mall. First, is it or is it not part of Edinburgh&#8217;s common good? It is not for the committee to decide what is, and what is not, common good property. Secondly, should the site have a specific exemption from the legislation? The City of Edinburgh Council insisted that Princes mall is not part of its common good portfolio. It asked us to consider an exemption and we concluded that the case for such an exemption is still to be made. I note the movement in the Government undergrowth on the issue.</p><p>Parliament should agree that the bill be passed in order to complete this key part of the Scottish Law Commission&#8217;s programme of property law reform. It is time to end the types of ultra-long leases in Scotland that the bill addresses.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665573", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Long Leases (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As has been noted, the bill will convert ultra-long leases of more than 175 years into ownership.

We are painfully seeing it trying to find ways in which to adapt to the real geography of Scotland, and it is doing so with some difficulty. To us, the islands of Scotland are an integral part of our country, but it is clear that, to Ofgem, that is too much to bear in terms of being able to make a plan that fits the needs of all our areas.</p><p>I do not want to repeat the arguments that have been made in detail. Instead, I want to comment on a couple of points to show why it is necessary to get decisions much more quickly.</p><p>Of course there must be consultation with the energy utilities and so on. The processes must be gone through, but they must be simplified. There has not been a discussion by the Government in London about simplifying the process of creating an opportunity for us to move forward quickly on new sustainable renewables. In addition, there is a contradiction in the way in which the Government in London is operating to promote the renewables, which has a bearing on this debate.</p><p>My colleague Lord Thurso, the MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, has suggested in answers that he gave at Westminster that the Government is going to promote the first marine energy park in Scotland in the Pentland Firth this summer. That would add to an existing marine energy park that has been announced for south-west England.</p><p>It is interesting to see from the figures that the minister gave that developers in the south-west of England would be paid to develop offshore there under the current charging regime. That makes the marine energy park there quite attractive. However, marine energy park developers on both sides of the Pentland Firth would have to pay &#163;21.958097 per kilowatt for access to the grid. That contradiction will not help us have such development in Orkney or on the mainland of Scotland. If Ofgem is producing something, it will have to do so quickly or the UK Government may not announce a marine energy park for Scotland, because the contrast in outlook for the marine energy park in south-west England compared with that in north-west Scotland is embarrassing.</p><p>That leads me to suggest that, looking at the debate as it has developed, there are small schemes that require access to the grid and not just in the islands; plenty parts of the mainland have a very poor grid and people want access to it. Ofgem has been reviewing the problem of getting access to the grid and, from the discussions that it concluded in March, it looks as though, under the changes, the amount of liability and security required from generators to access the grid will be significantly reduced. That is all very well, but I have constituents in the Applecross Community Company who are attempting to create a small hydro scheme. SSE, which manages the grid in our part of the world, wants to charge them in the region of &#163;667,000 for access to the grid and to create a grid strengthening that would allow them to export electricity.</p><p>There are many people in the country who cannot get into the renewables revolution&#8212;in this case, it is a hydro scheme in Applecross&#8212;because of the huge costs involved. In fact, we will help to reduce fuel poverty by getting more people to generate their own electricity locally and that will help many people to prosper in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664896", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Project Transmit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The problem that we have is that Scotland is caught in the trap of an organisation called Ofgem, which was created in circumstances that do not reflect the needs of our country today.

However, I do not think that all the details of Crown estate devolution have been worked out as far as they should have been by this stage.</p><p>As members have said, communities have wanted powers over the adjacent sea bed and sea for many decades&#8212;indeed, for centuries. I have done some work recently on the Highland Land League in the 1880s: it demanded such powers, which even then involved articulating views that were much older. People felt robbed because they could not cross the area between the high and low watermarks to get to the sea without incurring costs from the landlords, as some parts of the Crown estate in Scotland had been devolved to landlords such as the Sutherland estates.</p><p>It would be excellent if we followed the Scottish Affairs Committee&#8217;s line of thinking that this Parliament&#8217;s Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee should have oversight of the way in which the devolution process would work. Marine Scotland was viewed as the body that should take an overview of the process, and our committee would then look at its activities. The management of the Crown Estate&#8217;s powers must be set up in a constitutional fashion, which would involve going through this Parliament.</p><p>There is confusion around the powers of the coastal communities fund. The devolution of powers to harbour trusts and community trusts at a more local level must be spelled out, but some harbour trusts are more aware than others of their community responsibilities. We must be aware that such devolution is not a blanket solution and must be explored further.</p><p>We must avoid penalising development, as members have mentioned, and we should review the Crown Estate Commissioners&#8217; current powers. We can remove the minor irritants, and the major irritants such as the fact that if you deepen a berth and use the spoil to build up a new quay, you will be charged for it just as you would if you dumped the spoil at sea. Those are restraints on development: harbour boards and the like should not have to pay such charges, and Highland Council should not have to pay the Crown Estate for hundreds of small jetties every year.</p><p>It is time that we in this Parliament assessed whether some of the Crown Estate&#8217;s powers should be removed. We must remove the barriers to development by stopping the need for the bureaucracy that is involved in charging &#163;100 for a small pier on the Cromarty Firth that was built from stone 100 years ago. I suggest that this Parliament should do that, before the process of managing the charges that are levied at a local level comes into play.</p><p>There is a question around the way in which charges on fish farms and offshore energy installations will be levied. Who will decide on the level of charges? Will every community negotiate with the fish farm company or the company that is developing offshore renewables? It is surely necessary to set a sensible level of benefits in an achievable fashion, and the Parliament has a major part to play in that process.</p><p>That has been missing from the debate. We have heard about the wish for double devolution and the need to avoid what Tavish Scott described as tax grabs from Edinburgh. I suggest that the further devolution of powers to Holyrood that is to come should involve devolution of all those processes, and I ask the minister to bear that in mind when he responds to the debate.</p><p>I apologise, Presiding Officer, because I will have to leave in a moment to deal with an urgent matter, but I will be glad to read what other members and the minister have to say in the Official Report.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665083", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crown Estate (Devolution)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David Stewart on bringing this necessary debate to the chamber.

We simply do not have a full picture of what is happening in tenant farming across Scotland to underpin the decisions that we need to make. I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to review the questions that are posed in the agricultural census to ensure that the most beneficial questions are being asked, with a minimum of bureaucracy.</p><p>I turn to the three specific provisions in the bill, which correct anomalies in the law. The committee unanimously supports all of them in principle and hopes that they will lead to more land being made available to let and the creation of a more conducive environment that will encourage new entrants to join the industry.</p><p>The bill follows many years of protracted debate in the tenant farming forum. It aims to achieve compromise between landlords and tenants in order to make progress on tenancy law. It is important to note that it was intended that two of the three provisions would be included in a 2011 order, but they were delayed due to the need for primary legislation, as the cabinet secretary said. That prevented them from being included in earlier instruments. Those provisions are long overdue, and the changes will complete the first phase of the tenant farming forum&#8217;s consideration.</p><p>The committee unanimously supports the extension of the category of tenants who can serve a counter-notice to a notice to quit that is issued by a landlord on the death of a tenant. The current definition of what constitutes a &#8220;near relative&#8221; in such circumstances is too restrictive, as it includes only the spouse or civil partner and any children, and it should be widened. The bill extends the definition to include grandchildren, which we welcome.</p><p>Many farmers made a case to the committee that the definition should be further extended to include, say, nieces and nephews. The committee was not unsympathetic to that call, but it was aware of possible unintended consequences of a further extension to the definition. We asked the Scottish Government to consult the TFF to see whether there was any appetite in that group for extending the definition to include other relatives. The TFF says that it does not support a further extension at this stage&#8212;although it will keep the matter under review&#8212;primarily because, as Scottish Land &amp; Estates states:</p><p>&#8220;it would effectively extend tenant rights and send another negative message to landlords.&#8221;</p><p>There was also a debate in the committee about when the change in definition should come into force and how the transitional arrangements should work. Some of my colleagues will discuss those aspects in greater detail.</p><p>The other two provisions were unanimously backed by the committee&#8212;first, the changes that will see upward-only and landlord-only initiated rent reviews prohibited in future limited duration tenancies; and, secondly, the disapplication of VAT rate changes and options to tax from being variations in rent that prevent rent reviews. The TFF agrees to those changes, as does the Scottish Government, and the committee supports them unanimously.</p><p>That brings me to the other issues that the committee received evidence on. We had a significant number of submissions, including anonymous and private submissions, from landlords and tenants, which gave the committee a startling insight into the challenges facing the tenant farming community in Scotland. Those included issues of wider land reform; how to attract more new entrants into farming and how best to support them; how to create the best environment for investment in holdings by landlords and tenants; how to make it clear beyond any doubt who is responsible for paying for what; and how tenants will be compensated for that investment when they move on or retire.</p><p>We called on the Scottish Government to consider establishing a register for prospective new entrants and also to work with the TFF in re-examining the issues of investment responsibility and appropriate compensation. Thankfully, the TFF is to produce a work plan setting out those priorities. I hope that that will not take another seven years and I am also pleased to learn that the industry is to take forward the idea of a new entrants register.</p><p>We heard evidence on the practices of land agents, and we support the development of a code of practice, which would, we hope, ensure greater consistency of practice and behaviour among all those providing land-agent services.</p><p>Members need to be aware of the legal disputes surrounding agricultural tenancies, which sadly end up in the Land Court and the Court of Session. The committee heard evidence on the establishment of a more effective system of dispute resolution and called on the Government to urgently look at arbitration.</p><p>In my speech during the stage 1 debate on the Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill, I spoke about the need to dovetail that bill with the Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill and the Long Leases (Scotland) Bill, which the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee is also scrutinising, and I stress that need again. We must develop a comprehensive picture of land use and ownership in Scotland, with better mapping.</p><p>The Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill is not the solution to the many challenges facing the tenant farming community. Further legislation will be needed and we should not rule it out for fear of overregulation. The important thing is that the legislation does what we want it to do and helps those whom we intend it to help.</p><p>The fundamental question behind the bill still remains that of how we can improve the lot of tenants in the balance between the rights of agricultural landlords and the rights of agricultural tenants to ensure that Scotland can look forward to a healthy and vibrant tenant farming sector.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664295", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that there has been enough speculation, but I suppose that, even in the member&#8217;s devo plus proposals, there might be a decision to take forward these kind of things in Scotland.

Registration of aspects of leasing are as important as registration of ownership, and there has been much debate on both bills about ensuring that that happens. It is in our interests that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee bears that in mind at stage 2 and ensures that the bills dovetail.</p><p>I turn to the excellent report from the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and highlight the issue of Ordnance Survey maps. The 6in:1 mile map&#8212;or the 1:10,000 map as it is now called&#8212;was used for the whole of the Highlands and Islands for many years. It is not up to scratch; it never was. It was not fit for purpose when we were having these debates in the mid-1990s, at a time when land registration was 20 years old. Did anyone ask Ordnance Survey to step up to the plate and get mapping properly? It is a union dividend for us that large areas of Scotland are inadequately mapped by Ordnance Survey. One per cent of the titles of Scotland are affected by the 1:10,000 scale, but of those, many are the largest estates that have never been registered except in sasines, and they are not properly mapped at all.</p><p>Why is that important? Crofting communities have a right to buy, and such communities have to provide details in mapped form of the area of which they wish to take ownership. We would therefore expect it to be necessary for landowners themselves to have their land mapped in a modern and up-to-date fashion. There is a direct link here between those issues, which is part of this Parliament&#8217;s wishes. I know that the Labour Party did not wish to see a map-based register for crofting, but as many people who are registering leases for farms and so on have to do that, Labour should recognise now that landowners should be registered and that crofters eventually will be, too. There has been no secondary legislation on that yet, but it is a point.</p><p>Annabel Goldie and others have mentioned fees. I suggest that, for a large estate, the price for registration is like selling off a couple of housing plots. Large estates are not short of capital for registration, so why are we not making the point that they have got the benefit now of voluntary registration at a reduced ad valorem rate? They should get on with it, or we should find means to ensure that we use the research area approach of the bill not just to apply to cities but to apply to areas in which communities may wish to use the right to buy, because they will have to have accurate maps to do that.</p><p>The bill is an excellent start, but it is important for Scotland&#8217;s future that the timeframe for the completion of the register is speeded up, because 30 or 40 years might not be a long time in land ownership, but it most certainly is when it comes to getting an up-to-date register that people can access electronically. Registers of Scotland&#8217;s mapping working group should ask Ordnance Survey when it will step up to the plate. We know that, during the Thatcher era, Ordnance Survey was cut back and was made to be a business, but it is supposed to be a service. Instead of seeking other means, we should demand that that service is there for us to use in future.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662970", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the convener of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, I have an interest in the Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill dovetailing with the Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill and the Long Leases (Scotland) Bill, both of which are before my committee.

We can see the symptoms of extreme weather patterns before our eyes. On 4 January, Scots once again faced hurricane-force winds, as 100mph gales battered the country and caused widespread damage and disruption. The wind speeds on that day exceeded those of the gales on 8 December last year, which pawky Scots dubbed hurricane bawbag. However, the subject is very important and much less jokey than that.</p><p>The debate allows us to home in on the fact that the global impacts start right here. We can see that from not just the gales, but a story in The Observer last Sunday, which said:</p><p>&#8220;Food prices to soar as drought hits key crops ... Most of the south-east of England was officially declared to be in drought last week, and large swaths of the Midlands and south of England were confirmed as &#8216;at risk&#8217;, with hosepipe bans and other restrictions likely to be introduced soon.</p><p>Farmers are particularly at risk as the spring growing season approaches.&#8221;</p><p>Even in south-east England, we can see symptoms that are magnified in many other parts of the world.</p><p>On 29 February, The Economic Times reported:</p><p>&#8220;The record-breaking cold that gripped Europe this winter could be tied to a surprising culprit, a steep decline in sea ice in the Arctic following a warming of the polar region ... Using ... observational data and computer modelling&#8221;,</p><p>scientists have claimed that, when the Arctic sea ice melts, that results in</p><p>&#8220;changes in atmospheric conditions, increased moisture levels to colder temperatures and increased snowfall across North America, Europe and Asia.&#8221;</p><p>Those are the symptoms that are on our doorsteps.</p><p>Oxfam has pointed out that, in relation to disasters in many parts of the world, women make up 20 million&#8212;80 per cent&#8212;of the 26 million people who are estimated to have been displaced by climate change. Women were hardest hit by the disasters in Bangladesh&#8212;the death rate of women was almost five times higher than that of men, because women had not been taught to swim and did not receive warning information.</p><p>That shows the extent and range of the issues. As the Scottish Human Rights Commission has pointed out, the complex range of climate change issues directly or indirectly affect human rights, including the right to life, the right to adequate food, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to adequate housing, the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and many others. Our debate on climate justice gives us an opportunity to show how we can add, through the climate justice fund, to the international fight against the problems of climate change, and conduct that fight here, at home.</p><p>The First Minister was praised by the Scottish Human Rights Commission and others when he went to China to make his remarks about human rights. We have to think about the impact of our activities on other parts of the world. The United Nations has a programme for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. We know that many of our farmers import soya from South America. We have to ask what impact that has on the biodiversity of the areas in which it is grown. Although REDD stands for &#8220;reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation&#8221;, there is another meaning, which is &#8220;reaping profits from eviction, land grabs, deforestation and the destruction of biodiversity&#8221;. That is a common problem. We must ensure that we conduct ourselves in a fashion that sends a signal that this country takes seriously the effects that we have on others.</p><p>Following Durban, a tremendous effort has been made to move forward in the way in which we count carbon. That will help other countries, too. Peat soils can now be measured, and they will be. They cover just over a fifth of Scotland&#8217;s land area and we have two thirds of the UK&#8217;s blanket and raised bog habitat, so we have a major job to do. Scotland&#8217;s deepest peats store about 6,500 megatonnes of carbon, which is 10 times the amount that is stored in the whole of the UK&#8217;s forest biomass, as I pointed out in a debate on peatlands in November 2010. We can measure our peatlands to help us to reduce our emissions, but we have to invest to ensure that they remain wetted and are part of the global fight against climate change. They are that big.</p><p>I will finish with some brief remarks on local action. A farmers co-operative that is based in the Black Isle is spearheading a drive to develop locally owned, small-scale wind energy projects across the Highlands. Highland Business Services Ring, which is based at Tore, is better known for using for its buying power help its 1,100 members secure better terms when they buy fuel or tractor parts.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "My view in this important debate is that climate justice cannot be left to others.

In August 2010, I suggested that the new &#163;2&#160;billion green investment bank should be based in Scotland to bring it closer to the industry and the parts of the country that will contribute most to building a low-carbon economy.</p><p>That argument is reinforced today. It is important for the whole UK that Scotland has a stable platform for the development of the energy revolution that we are talking about. That is why I take issue with the suggestion that it is not in the UK&#8217;s interests to site the green investment bank in Edinburgh. The fact is that the UK will require Scotland&#8217;s green electricity output to help it to meet its climate change target. That will not change no matter the political circumstances&#8212;for or against independence though members may be.</p><p>There is cross-party commitment to a UK-wide green investment bank that will help to direct investment to the industries, improvements and key areas that can help to build a new green economy. As members have said, Edinburgh is the best place because it is where all those facets meet.</p><p>Above all, we need to have a stable renewable energy development policy across the UK and in Scotland. I note that the Energy and Climate Change Committee at Westminster warned last week that the UK Government must not miss the boat on renewables development, as it has previously.</p><p>With that stability of policy in mind, one priority should be a focus on having a green investment bank in the best place possible. However, the recent call by 100 Tory MPs to halt land-based wind developments hit a very jarring note. I think that David Cameron wants to be seen as a green leader, so he might bat that call aside. However, the situation is not helped by BBC presenters such as Matt Baker, who was yesterday quoted, as the presenter of &#8220;Countryfile&#8221;, criticising wind turbines springing up in the countryside as the greatest threat to rural work&#8212;that is the BBC view, balanced as ever.</p><p>I note that the embryo green investment bank has been set up in London and that it will then have to grow in some other place. I also note that the advisory committee that was set up to help with the development and structure of the bank has, in my view&#8212;I may be proved wrong&#8212;very little experience of Scottish conditions and attributes. That aspect of how the bank is being set up bothers me considerably, as it may affect its direction towards our part of the country.</p><p>The proximity to companies and individuals who are working on the front line of decarbonising our economy is not available anywhere other than Edinburgh. My concerns about the need for a stable policy and about some of the mixed signals that come out of what is said down south are considerable.</p><p>I recognise the focus that the green investment bank will have on offshore renewables. The cutting-edge developments in offshore renewables are being made by companies in the north of Scotland. Of course, there have been offshore developments of considerable size down south, but the world-beating materials that are now being developed in the Moray Firth represent the kind of intellectual knowledge that will be sold on to America, Brazil and so on. Those have to be developed and backed.</p><p>We talk about the &#163;2&#160;billion public investment. As Graeme Pearson said, we know that a vast amount of money will be required for developments to meet the targets for energy production and emissions reduction in the green investment bank&#8217;s remit. Scotland is widely recognised as having enormous potential in that area. In my constituency, the Pentland Firth provides potential for, in particular, tidal power. That is a great goal. Many other places in the UK can contribute to the targets but, proportionally, Scotland has far more potential. It is almost like the proportion of peatlands in Scotland compared with the whole of the rest of the UK&#8212;about 80 per cent are in Scotland. The emphasis on the things that we can do here will not only help us but will be vital to both the UK and the European targets to reduce climate gases.</p><p>The UK Government needs to ensure that we have access to the rest of the fossil fuel levy. It should not keep it for three years, as we need that money to develop now. The green investment bank might be seeded with some of that money, which will help Scotland to access it, but we also need the transmission charging regime to be sorted out. The green investment bank has a lot of hurdles to cross before it can make the major contribution that we require and which the UK and Europe is looking forward to us achieving.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661394", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Investment Bank"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the deputy convener of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee in the previous session of Parliament and a member of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee when it considered the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill, I argued early on, at the time of the previous Labour Government at Westminster, that the green investment bank should be in Scotland.

It means that people can fly from islands and from Wick out of the area and spend money one way or another. However, what we need is a public service obligation, as that allows remote communities to benefit from people coming into the area to spend money as well as allowing people to leave. We have never had a debate about that because although Barra, unlike most other places, has such a scheme, the idea of discussing something that would support our most remote areas through flights that would allow people to get to them for a reasonable price is for a future agenda. The air discount scheme was proposed by the Labour and Liberal Democrats coalition Government as a stop-gap measure because it was not prepared to pay for public service obligations.</p><p>The second point that I want to make is about out-of-town developments and regeneration in town centres. As long as people want to shop in large out-of-town supermarkets, there will be little reason for them to go into small towns such as Wick and other places in my constituency. With large regeneration funds, unless there is a rebalancing of the rates so that money from rates from out-of-town developments can be spent in town centres, we will get nowhere, and regeneration will be a fig leaf.</p><p>Thirdly, colleges in the Highlands and Islands have something important to offer the rest of the country. The University of the Highlands and Islands colleges are trying to cut out the duplication that happens in regions. Mary Scanlon mentioned distance learning, which is very much part of that approach. We do not have to have the same courses in seven or eight colleges in different geographical areas. The rest of the country must catch up with that approach. Distance learning can save on lecturers&#8212;indeed, it has probably already done so&#8212;but I would like to see greater savings in administration than there have been so far.</p><p>I turn to aspects of the rural affairs, climate change and environment budget.

The spending provisions for the rural affairs and environment portfolio are largely dominated by the provision made from the common agricultural policy, along with spending objectives that are related to non-departmental public bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Forestry Commission Scotland, Forest Enterprise Scotland, Marine Scotland, which is a collective of bodies, and a range of other initiatives including the research that is undertaken by the main research providers and other initiatives by non-governmental charities. The portfolio also includes spending on climate change provisions.</p><p>By and large, when we consider the way in which the budget has fared in the current round, it should be noted that the budgets for the single farm payment, the Scottish beef calf scheme, the less favoured areas support scheme, LEADER, technical and crofting assistance and common agricultural policy compliance improvements all remain static through to 2014-15. All those parts of the budget relate to the European Union and the common agricultural policy. I am glad that, at this time, those parts are stable. However, I am intensely worried that, if the euro zone crisis reached a point at which the budget for the CAP was cut, we would not be able to support what is a vital industry in this country with the level of funds that has been supplied in the past through our taxes and through the common agricultural policy and which has benefited and been welcomed by many farmers.</p><p>With those strictures in mind, we should recognise that, because of the overall picture, cuts had to made to the Scottish elements of the budget although, in general, those are a much smaller part of the total budget than the common agricultural policy mechanisms that I have mentioned.</p><p>In particular, there have been discussions on the proposed reduction in spending on agri-environment schemes, from about &#163;48&#160;million to &#163;40&#160;million in the coming year. However, it is clear to the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee that the budget will be well spent, and we will monitor how it is spent. The cabinet secretary has said that there is a possibility of moving money around between various budget heads if a demand for services arises. We intend to keep a close watch on the budget as the year progresses to see that that money is spent. We believe that agri-environment schemes benefit the whole of agriculture enormously, because they usually occur alongside commercial agriculture and in areas where agriculture is difficult, such as the crofting areas of the Western Isles and the north of Scotland. We are concerned, but we recognise that some parts of the budget have to be cut. The cabinet secretary does not want to cut any part of the budget, but he has had to cut that one.</p><p>There are benefits in the budget, too. Around 79 people applied recently to be new entrants into farming and 63 were approved. Support for that amounts to a mere &#163;2&#160;million, but it has allowed 63 people to begin a farming career. We hope that as many as that will come into farming next year.</p><p>Land and sea research has been maintained and, in the colleges that do that research, so has the staffing. That is a success story, given the budget cuts that are being forced on us from further south.</p><p>The common fisheries policy is in a state of flux, but it is unlikely to change very much in the next year. We are keen for that budget to be maintained. Scotland, with 70 per cent of Britain&#8217;s fisheries and the major share of sustainable stocks in Europe, must have Government support to ensure that those stocks are maintained. We welcome the funds that are being put in that direction.</p><p>One of the major elements of expansion that will create more jobs is the roughly 150 per cent increase in the budget for the food and drink industries. That is a great news story that is about our investing in success. Scottish food and drink is selling around this country, the rest of Britain and abroad in increasing quantities. I am sure that Richard Lochhead is happy to talk about that whenever the subject crops up. From the committee&#8217;s point of view, the skewing towards the creation of jobs as a result of that funding shows that many areas in the budget are to our good.</p><p>In addition, we have delivered a manifesto commitment to a small land fund, which will allow communities to begin to buy their land again and bring it into productive use.

The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Caroline Spelman, and her deputy, Jim Paice, have proposed drastic cuts in direct subsidies. That does not meet the needs of Scottish agricultural conditions, as our evidence will show.</p><p>Notwithstanding the size of the industry, food production is essential to everyone&#8217;s life. Although it is a small part of the overall economy, food and drink is one of the real Scottish economic success stories, and the Scottish National Party Government has set ambitious growth targets that aim to build the value of the industry from &#163;10 billion per annum to &#163;12.5 billion by 2017. Last year, food exports from Scotland broke through the &#163;1 billion barrier.</p><p>With regard to the proposed future CAP support system, the maintenance of the broad two-pillar structure of the CAP and the budget has been welcomed by farming interests and the Scottish Government, and fits with what was proposed in the Pack review.</p><p>In relation to pillar 1, Scotland currently has a ceiling for single farm payments of &#8364;647 million, of which &#8364;82 million is deducted through modulation and used to fund the Scotland rural development programme. In relation to pillar 2, the Scotland rural development programme is funded through that pot. Between 2007 and 2013, Scotland has a maximum of &#8364;680 million of European funding.</p><p>The committee has, in its scrutiny of the subject, taken evidence so far from Scottish MEPs and, in round-table format, from stakeholders. It is still to take evidence from the United Kingdom and Scottish Governments before it writes up its conclusions and recommendations. Jim Paice, the minister of state at DEFRA, will give evidence to the committee on 7 March, followed by Richard Lochhead on 14 March. The committee will then agree its interim report.</p><p>The CAP review process will continue through 2012. Draft reports from the European Commission are expected around April 2012, and the committee may consider taking evidence from Scottish MEPs at an appropriate point in the year, and from the secretary of state, Caroline Spelman, whom I finally managed to meet briefly last Thursday on her courtesy visit to the Parliament.</p><p>The following themes have emerged in evidence. The overall EU budget and the current state of the euro zone will have a significant impact on the CAP reforms. Will the CAP budget be slashed? Could that delay the reforms that are due to come into place on 1 January 2014, and could it impact in particular on rural development support?</p><p>NFU Scotland said that there must be a planned bridging mechanism to avoid the 12 to 18-month gap in agri-environment support that occurred last time. Scottish Environment LINK agreed that bridging was needed, as it looks as if 2015 is a more realistic start date for the new CAP.</p><p>MEPs warned of the possibility of a shrinking budget and diminishing pillar 1 funds in particular. Our committee has to ask if Scotland is prepared in the longer term for those funds to diminish. MEPs raised the issues of food security and the need to achieve the right balance between food production and sustainability and environment measures.</p><p>On that subject, Alyn Smith MEP commented in The Press and Journal on 13 January that he believed that</p><p>&#8220;the UK government was na&#239;ve in its thinking that higher ex-farm prices could justify the phasing out or elimination of direct subsidies. They ignore the equally high increases in input costs which wipe out a farmer&#8217;s margins, or the de facto difficulties of farmers to actually secure these higher prices due to supply chain pressures.&#8221;</p><p>In relation to pillar 1 and pillar 2, Scotland obviously wants to ensure that the UK gets a fair share of funds and that Scotland gets an appropriate share of those UK funds&#8212;a share that takes account of the particular challenges that are faced in Scotland. Pressure will come from the calls of new member states in eastern Europe.</p><p>On the proposed changes to the administration of pillar 1 funds, the new basic payment scheme&#8212;direct payments based on area&#8212;is supported as a better alternative to the previous, historically based payments. However, many felt that, although a flat rate would be administratively simple, it would not work in Scotland without significant tailoring to the Scottish environment. Stakeholders were concerned about how the trigger for eligibility for area payments would work. The NFUS and the Scottish Tenant Farmers Association were happy that it would be linked to holdings in 2011 but felt that a stronger link was required between the amount of land that someone had in 2011 and the amount of entitlements that they could claim in 2014.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658824", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy (Reform)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The common agricultural policy proposals that are to be set in place by January 2014 must be made to be good for Scotland&#8217;s highly successful food and drink industry and our outstanding environment.

Because new entrants would not have qualified for single farm payments in the past, the 2011 trigger could exclude them in the future. It was felt that basing the scheme on the submission of an integrated administration and control system form rather than a 2011 entitlement would be better from the new entrants&#8217; point of view.</p><p>On the greening schemes within pillar 1, there were concerns about permanent pasture and crop diversification proposals. The definition of permanent pasture as grassland that is more than five years old was deemed not suitable, with Scottish Environment LINK stressing that such a definition was too broad and crude and would not sufficiently target the most biodiverse, high nature value grassland. There was a feeling that the EU must allow flexibility. Greening must not mean more cross-compliance. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the greening of pillar 1 as long as the measures fitted the Scottish situation.</p><p>On the capping of direct payments, in the evidence that the committee received, people questioned what would happen to the money that was saved. Would capping be an incentive or not? Would the process be bureaucratic? Would the money be kept in Scotland? If not, would it be possible for us to have extra funds? At present, it seems that only 35 companies receive more than &#163;300,000 in single farm payments, with about 150 companies receiving more than &#163;150,000. That is a small minority of farmers, but it is a significant group and the money may be useful.</p><p>Getting new entrants into farming is the biggest challenge of all. The national reserve, which has been mentioned, is important for that purpose.</p><p>Many felt that assisting less favoured areas is a top priority for Scotland and that we must ensure that the reforms are flexible enough to allow Scotland to do that. The proposals address that through the areas of natural constraint and by allowing some coupled payments. The Highlands and Islands agricultural group and crofters stressed the importance of targeting support at &#8220;vulnerable areas&#8221;&#8212;that is, areas at risk of de-stocking, where continued agricultural activity provides environmental and social benefits.</p><p>High nature value farming areas have been the subject of some discussion and were considered as a vehicle for targeting spending at the most vulnerable areas. On a visit that I made last August to a high nature value farm at Forsie in Caithness, I saw high nature value farming working alongside major commercial cattle and sheep farming. The message is simple: bird-life needs continued grazing, and it needs land to be managed; if land is abandoned or given over only to sheep, precious habitats may be lost. To succeed, constant vigilance and partnership between local farmers are required.</p><p>The submission on the CAP proposals from the European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism argued for targeted payments for types of high nature value farming in defined areas and said that environmental organisations must be mentioned explicitly as advisers to farmers and crofters on the ways to enter such schemes.</p><p>The NFUS and Scottish Environment LINK say that designation is not the issue and that the scheme is the key thing. The current less favoured area support scheme does not target areas that are in need and must be more environmentally focused.</p><p>The small farmers scheme was not welcomed because it was hoped that the related cross-compliance and greening would happen on crofts. Crofters said that their common grazings must be taken into account as well.</p><p>Many stressed that the priority is to get a fairer pillar 2 share from the EU and the UK. Scottish Environment LINK is concerned that not enough money will be available to deliver environmental objectives and to help farming to diversify. A frozen budget means a budget cut in real terms.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament and our Scottish Government must get a direct say in the final arrangements for the new CAP.

Today, the anti-independence parties&#8212;or at least their leaderships&#8212;have joined up to shelve the debate about increased levers of power for the Scottish Government to build a sustainable nation. That comes in the midst of a global economic crisis. Since the SNP gained a minority Government in 2007, the anti-independence parties have devised means to divert and limit the options for Scotland&#8217;s future. Wendy Alexander spent months trying to show that limited borrowing powers would not improve economic growth. The Clegg-Cameron Scotland Bill offered another menu of minor changes that has enmeshed the Parliament since May 2011.

Civic Scotland knows that it can draw on that work as it seeks to debate Scotland&#8217;s future. However, that has not stopped the UK Government making policies that can harm Scotland in the meantime and blunt our aspirations. At present, the most vulnerable in our society face being attacked by the Tory-Liberal welfare cuts.

I was very disappointed that the budget adviser to the Finance Committee dismissed the whole subject of climate change in about five lines in his briefing paper. When we consider the potential ways of dealing with climate change, we can see means in various parts of the investment that we will make.</p><p>I will quote from Professor David Bell&#8217;s words:</p><p>&#8220;In the budget document, spending on climate change is taken as an exemplar of preventative spend.&#8221;</p><p>He mentions the reduction in the need for fire services as an example&#8212;which is strange&#8212;and then states:</p><p>&#8220;It would also be useful to have some evidence of the costs, as well as the benefits of climate change interventions.&#8221;</p><p>That is precisely why we need the read-across between all the committees that have taken the time to work out how their activities will act as preventative spending and reduce our need to spend on other aspects. I ask the cabinet secretary, and the Finance Committee, to take seriously the strictures of my committee.</p><p>The second aspect that is interesting in terms of getting a read-across is the question of the sustainability agenda, which the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee discussed. The Finance Committee also discussed that issue and took evidence from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which referred to the loss of the Scottish sustainable development indicator set. The way in which that could be developed could be helpful to us.</p><p>I recognise that we are at an early stage of working out how best to create the indicators. It is important to acknowledge that, although we have made a start and are leading the rest of the world, we must improve on what we have just now.</p><p>In my committee&#8217;s report to the Finance Committee, we said,</p><p>&#8220;At times, the Committee found the process of scrutinising the Scottish Government&#8217;s spending on climate change mitigation to be frustrating due to the cross-cutting nature of climate change mitigation policy. To fully scrutinise the spending, the Committee would have had to have conducted a cross-cutting inquiry over a range of portfolios, which is not practical in the time available.&#8221;</p><p>I would add that that would also not be within our committee&#8217;s remit. The report continued:</p><p>&#8220;Therefore, in advance of future budget scrutiny, the Committee intends to consider how best all the relevant committees, including the Finance Committee, can better scrutinise spending on climate change mitigation and adaptation policies across the Scottish Government&#8217;s responsibilities.&#8221;</p><p>My committee will initiate a dialogue with other committees on that issue and will try to help with the process.</p><p>Some small, good things have been done that will improve the way in which land use is monitored in this regard. For example, the farming for a better climate scheme, which has been maintained, recognises that it is not only the Government but other public bodies, private firms and individuals that will spend to mitigate climate change and will all have a part to play. The approach does not ask for a bucketload more of Government spending; it is about everyone addressing the priorities in a serious way.</p><p>We discussed the intention to focus on projects such as the support for anaerobic digestion facilities. That is the kind of thing that allows economic development in the countryside to move forward from the pilot projects that are in place at the moment.</p><p>There are many things that could be said about the issues in the report, but the six minutes that are available to me do not allow me to say them. However, the carbon assessment of the budget is a clear matter of considerable importance to us all. My committee accepts that the process of providing a carbon assessment of the budget, using the carbon assessment tool, and of carbon accounting, is still developing. However, we note that the progress of developing the Scottish Government&#8217;s carbon accounting needs to be improved, ideally before the next budget. Therefore, we recommend that the Scottish Government examine options for securing further funding to assist that development to ensure that a more effective carbon assessment of the budget can be undertaken in future.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658171", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Spending Review 2011 and Draft Budget 2012-13"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will touch on matters related to the rural affairs, climate change and environment portfolio, which my committee scrutinised.

I have a natural interest from a constituency point of view in how this works. For example, SEARS&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s environment and rural services&#8212;is a partnership of nine organisations that are beginning to work together to deliver in our area so that there are far fewer visits to farms, crofts and the like. That way of working began across Scotland before the last election and represents a major change in the way in which the necessary regulation of farms and crofts should take place. I am delighted that it has been possible to do that, with the help of the regulatory review group; SEARS, which was set up by the Government, ensures that those nine organisations collaborate and do not send nine people at any time across the calendar to visit a farm.</p><p>I am glad that the carbon capture and storage project board has been joined by Professor Griggs, because that is one place where local authorities work together. It was all very well for Mary Scanlon to suggest in her intervention earlier that COSLA has not responded to the regulatory review group but, on the question of piping away CO2, the local authorities that might be affected by such moves have agreed to co-operate on simplifying the planning processes to allow that to happen. That is another win-win situation should we ever get to a stage of being able to take carbon capture and storage forward.</p><p>I was very interested to read in the regulatory review group&#8217;s report about the end-of-life vehicles exercise that SEPA has effected. That will become very important in my work, because the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee will be looking at the Zero Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2011. Dealing with vehicles at the end of their life in a fashion that will help properly set-up vehicle breakers to carry through their important work has huge environmental implications, as do cowboy operations, which are something that we must try to stop. The beginnings of that work have been shown to be successful. SEPA has become much more customer friendly and its processes have become much more streamlined, which I think many people celebrate.</p><p>The question of small businesses and small communities has been raised in a number of ways. I put it to members that local authorities can break down contracts into bite-sized bits that many smaller organisations and businesses, such as architects, could tender for. I believe that it is fundamental that our local authorities take those chances, because I have seen examples in Highland where that sort of thing has not happened, to the detriment of many local farmers.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In its earlier work, the regulatory reform group concentrated on many of the areas of my concern in the fields of rural affairs, climate change and the environment.

Professor Griggs has pointed out that the EU audit trail issues that affect so many of our people who apply for grants under the Scotland rural development programme are additional regulatory burdens. Moreover, the EU auditors have never been in at the initial stages of creating the legislation. The lesson for us from that is that the audit approach must be built in at the earliest stages. The debate about the bill in 2013 will have a major bearing on that. Secondly, we must use our influence in Europe to ensure that the regulations that are put in place have those audit matters built in.</p><p>I move on to something that is also international and also a climate change issue: the way in which legislation regarding shipping and the marine environment is affected. I had a very useful meeting with the British Chamber of Shipping recently and, in a follow-up, it talked about the development of marine management. Adrian Lester said to me in a communication:</p><p>&#8220;While developed from a common legislative and philosophical base we have noticed distinct differences in the approach of Marine Scotland versus that of Defra and the MMO in the implementation of marine planning, including offshore renewable energy and marine conservation. The holistic view and evidence based approach of Marine Scotland is refreshing and extremely positive.&#8221;</p><p>The point is that there are ways of reducing regulation by ensuring that the 85 acts that apply in the marine area are dealt with by one body. We have too many side issues, such as the Crown Estate. Marine Scotland sets up a process that is holistic and should be able to take this forward. That is one of the reasons why constitutional change has got to be borne in mind in this debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656800", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regulatory Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is no doubt about that.

Someone ought to ask why this coalition Government does not go out of its way to tax the non doms, to tax the bankers, and to fine the kind of people who actually caused the deep financial problems.

Many non-governmental organisations remind us endlessly in their briefing papers of the need for better delivery on our own targets, but they do not always applaud the progress that we have made. I want to show how, through our actions here, we can work along with our international partners to underpin world-wide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The scientists&#8217; measurements of Scotland&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions are as follows. In 2009, the emissions&#8212;including emissions from international aviation and shipping and with the figures adjusted to take account of trading in the European Union emission trading scheme&#8212;amounted to 52 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is 27.6 per cent lower than in the 1990 base year. Between 2008 and 2009, they were reduced by 3.8 per cent, or 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Ignoring the effects of trading in the EU ETS, Scottish greenhouse gas emissions fell by 7 per cent between 2008 and 2009, and by 29 per cent between 1990&#8212;the base year&#8212;and 2009. We are warned that in 2010-11&#8212;it takes a long while to get the results&#8212;there has been a small increase; however, we have made plans for an average reduction of 3 per cent per year between now and 2020. It is important that people in Scotland grasp the fact that the action will be cumulative.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament must encourage other nations to see the ways in which our groundbreaking proposals and policies are setting out to achieve the ambitious targets that Scotland has set. However, meeting legally binding climate change targets is challenging. For example, some recent calculations by NGOs of cumulative emissions reductions, as opposed to year-on-year savings, got rather muddled up; Stop Climate Chaos Scotland has apologised to the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee for drawing wrong conclusions at an earlier stage of our taking evidence on this year&#8217;s budget, which it originally described as putting us</p><p>&#8220;on a path for embarrassing failure.&#8221;</p><p>We are not on a path for failure; we are in the midst of success.</p><p>I turn to marine emissions. The RPP says that the Scottish Government is working with operators and the ports sector, particularly those that are receiving public support, as the improvements to the efficiency of our subsidised fleet are dependent on the pace of vessel replacement.</p><p>I understand that the Government is considering whether there is scope for more efficient powering of vessels in port through connection to shoreside power sources. The Government supports efforts for an international agreement on carbon emissions from shipping, and the battery-operated ferries that are under construction on the Clyde show that we have the potential to build a huge number of ships for commercial purposes to new designs just to meet the needs of our northern isles and Western Isles services. That has the potential to be a great new industry for Scotland.</p><p>We need an international agreement to be brokered at Durban so that no part of the world is disadvantaged by a cap-and-trade scheme for marine fuel. The EU carbon trading scheme is one model, but I hope that the Scottish Government will help delegates at the 17th conference of the parties to consider a United Nations-backed scheme that bears in mind the arguments of the Chamber of Shipping on those urgently needed agreements.</p><p>Peatlands have been mentioned. Scotland holds a special place among the 175 nations globally that have peatlands, as it has 80 per cent of the peatlands in the UK, which is in the top 10 countries in the world. Some of the worlds best blanket bogs are found in Scotland, including the flow country, which is in my constituency. There is considerable international interest in our peatland restoration work at that site and substantial income goes to the area from EU LIFE funds in recognition of its environmental significance. Scotland&#8217;s deepest peatlands store about 6,500 megatonnes of carbon, which is 10 times the amount of carbon that is stored in the whole of the UK&#8217;s forest biomass. A loss of only 1 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s peat would equal annual greenhouse gas emissions of about 57 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. Conversely, restoring damaged peatland could greatly reduce emissions and contribute to meeting Scotland&#8217;s climate change targets.</p><p>Peatlands are important for carbon reduction and clean water, and Scotland has a key role in consequent research work. The centre for ecology and hydrology has a greenhouse gas monitoring station in the flow country. The environmental research institute in Thurso, under the leadership of Professor Stuart Gibb, is creating a hub for that cutting-edge technology. There is a clear community of interest in peatlands across a wide range of organisations. We need to muster the considerable peatland expertise and resources in the public and private sectors in Scotland and across the UK and Europe to lead to a UN-backed order at Durban to measure land-management emissions in every country.</p><p>To achieve the required scale and urgency of action, the UN must recognise the challenges of the current economic climate and deliver the urgent actions at COP17.

In a world in which Governments such the United Kingdom and France continue to cling to nuclear as a fait accompli, Germany is taking steps from which we could all learn to build a cleaner and more sustainable energy market. I do not want to focus on the disaster at Fukushima or the tragedy at Chernobyl, but those incidents have encouraged German and Japanese voters to demand change. The grave dangers of nuclear energy are well known, and those who describe nuclear as safe would have a hard time making their case to a family affected by those disasters.</p><p>Some up-to-date news from Japan is pertinent. Last month, nuclear plant usage fell to a record low of 20.6 per cent, down from 66.7 per cent a year earlier, and 60 per cent of Japanese have little or no confidence in nuclear power. Radiation levels 20 times higher than normal have been found 60km from Fukushima, whose decommissioning could cost $15 billion, with a possible compensation bill of $59 billion. Energy-saving measures in Japan have led to a drop in electricity demand, and a new law has recently been passed to promote the use of renewable power in the Japanese grid.</p><p>Instead of looking backwards to those awful events, I would like members to think about our future and whether we are prepared to take bold and decisive action to power it in a clean, safe and sustainable way. Some may describe Germany&#8217;s move to phase out nuclear energy in 10 years as drastic, and some will cry, &#8220;How will they fill their energy gap?&#8221; and &#8220;How will they stay competitive in a European and global energy market?&#8221; The German federal Government is not daft, and it has outlined a three-pronged approach to maintain Germany&#8217;s status as an energy hub. It is important for members on all sides to hear exactly how a major world economy can still thrive without the crutch of nuclear power.</p><p>The first and most beautifully simple of those measures is to drive energy efficiency as never before. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party Government has worked to boost energy efficiency in our homes and workplaces, and it can do a lot more. Moving on from that big step, the second prong to Germany&#8217;s nuclear-free survival guide is to drive carbon-free energy across all sectors. The German Government will make a fast and early national transition from coal and gas to renewables and will require all sectors to follow suit. Last month, for the first time, renewable energy crossed the 20 per cent mark in Germany, according to the German Association of Energy and Water Industries. The figure is now 20 per cent in Germany, but it is 30 per cent in Scotland.</p><p>In the past, some people have argued that withdrawing from nuclear energy production will lead only to a heavier reliance on fossil fuels; others doubt the readiness of clean renewables to fill the energy gap. The German Government thinks that that is tosh and, thankfully, so does the Scottish Government. The buy-in to our renewables potential will boost economic growth and substantially reduce our carbon emissions. Some Labour members have described our renewals target as a fairy story, pie in the sky and unworkable. Well, the people of Germany think that those Labour members are talking tosh and, judging by the election result in May, I think that so do the people of Scotland.</p><p>In placing faith in renewables, the German Government is encouraging innovation as never before. It aims to produce and use 6 million electric cars by 2030, and it aims to lead the world in renewables research and development. In Scotland, the SNP has big plans for our research and development and manufacturing sectors to make the most of our world-class facilities and opportunities. German utilities companies such as Siemens, E.ON and npower can collaborate with Scottish know-how, as Mitsubishi, Gamesa and others are already doing, to perfect more efficient turbine blades. We expect large companies from Europe and other parts of the world to work with us here.</p><p>The third and final step that the Germans will take in preparing to move towards a nuclear-free system is to develop the infrastructure that is needed in the long term to maintain a renewables system. In Scotland, we have seen Scottish and Southern Energy pull out of a consortium to build a new nuclear power station in Cumbria. It, too, is taking the Scottish way. Ian Marchant, the SSE chief executive, says that SSE&#8217;s strategic objective is to have</p><p>&#8220;more than our fair share of renewables and less than our fair share of nuclear&#8221;.</p><p>He adds that SSE has</p><p>&#8220;no experience in running a nuclear plant, so we would inevitably be the junior partner of a consortium, whereas in renewables, we could be leading a consortium&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>and it is.</p><p>The new German planning process should also create the basis for regulators to license related investments and thus provide certainty around the future of the grid. Special efforts will be made to adjust and roll out the necessary infrastructure, including the transmission networks that will transport wind power from the northern parts of the country to the south; smart distribution networks that can manage large numbers of electric cars; and power production from decentralised sources as well as sufficient storage options to deal with large shares of variable power sources. However, in Scotland, access to the fossil fuel levy, the acceleration of the work of the green investment bank and the time that it will take for the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets to sort out the transmission charging regime in favour of the renewables sector all rely on a UK Government that shows far too much interest in nuclear power and too little interest in the potential of renewables to work in our favour.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652617", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuclear Energy (Germany)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Germany has taken some bold, brave and important steps over the past year.

The annual debate about fishing allows us to review how Scotland is faring but, with a new form proposed for the common fisheries policy, it is also essential to recognise the part that we can play in showing that Scotland is in the lead and in underpinning the argument for Scotland needing a seat at the top table in making these decisions.</p><p>Sustainable management is at the root of what we are talking about. That is why I am glad to see that stocks of west coast haddock are on the rise and can make a fishery for the future.</p><p>Pioneering work on fish conservation, not only offshore but also inshore, shows that we are making progress. A number of examples have been given of how the Marine Stewardship Council&#8217;s sustainability status can improve a fishery. This example is not a positive story but a salutary lesson. Scotland&#8217;s Loch Torridon langoustine, or nephrops, fishery was withdrawn from the scheme in July. The suspension came after fishing pressure in the area increased due to additional creel fishing boats being attracted to the fishery. The Torridon group was unable&#8212;by itself or with the relevant management bodies&#8212;to establish management control over the fishery. An argument between creelers and trawlers ensued, following the announcement, so we must ensure that Marine Scotland management areas and inshore fishery groups work together to ensure that a combined fishery is sustainable. The standard of Loch Torridon langoustines is excellent and provides a benchmark for the fishery, which is one over which we have complete control. There are areas in which we can take forward Scotland&#8217;s pioneering fish conservation ourselves.</p><p>In the context of the common fisheries policy, we must look at ways of ensuring that fishery-dependent areas, which Jenny Marra mentioned, get some special treatment. In my constituency, the ports of Lochinver, Kinlochbervie and Scrabster are major participants in the fishery. From Lochinver, the participants are foreign boats, from Kinlochbervie there are one or two local boats&#8212;much reduced from the past&#8212;and in Scrabster there are boats with links to the Faroe Islands and other places. The latter has been having a relatively good time. The point is that they have been adding value in Scrabster and doing what the Government asked. They made sure that they are providing a service of which the fishing industry can be proud.</p><p>On looking after our better fisheries, we should look no further than Aberdeen University&#8217;s study of the use of CCTV on our fishing boats. The comparison of observation by students and CCTV shows that the approach is one that we can propose to the rest of the EU. At present, only Denmark and Scotland are adopting this approach, but if it is not a factor in discussions on the CFP, we will be missing a trick.</p><p>Much mention of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall suggests that we should use his ability to get publicity&#8212;it was on BBC 1 after all and one must be entertaining on that. We should bring him into discussions here. That would allow us to take forward the issues around a mixed fishery, and he could articulate them. I do not see why we should not trumpet our ability to differentiate in considering how this should work and get some celebrity chefs on our side. The arguments about scandalous waste go on and there must be solutions, which we want to lead.</p><p>Relative stability in catches is at the heart of much of the historic rights argument for Scottish fisheries. Comparisons with how the Norwegians manage their fisheries, with different types of fishing boats, are interesting. Norway is, of course, outside the EU, but it is one of the countries with which we have to negotiate every year. We could learn from its ability to manage its fisheries and emulate its approach in Scotland, given our large proportion of the EU fish catch. If it is not possible for the EU to set up a clear form of decentralisation, which members have been debating, it is no wonder that the common fisheries policy is described, as it is in the motion, as being a &#8220;failed&#8221; policy. Scotland does not deserve to be party to a failed policy when we have such a large part of the EU catch.</p><p>The motion is correct. It is a great time for negotiation, but there is an opportunity in the Parliament&#8217;s Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee to view some of the issues and to add to the body of knowledge&#8212;and, indeed, to the body of argument&#8212;through the allies that we can make.

That was before it encountered the rigours of the Arctic supply route to Archangel and Murmansk, the ice-free ports of our Soviet allies. I am delighted that some of the veterans are with us in the public gallery, along with Sergey Krutikov. [Applause.]</p><p>The Arctic convoys of world war two carried vital supplies to the northern Russian ports of Murmansk and Archangel from September 1941 until December 1944. From September 1942, the convoys of merchant ships accompanied by Royal Naval protection vessels were based at Loch Ewe.</p><p>The route that the convoys took was particularly hazardous, not only due to the horrendous weather and the dangers of drifting icebergs but because of the close proximity of German forces, who had occupied Norway. Winston Churchill called it</p><p>&#8220;the worst journey in the world&#8221;.</p><p>An annual remembrance ceremony is conducted at Loch Ewe. Last month, we stood by the Russian Convoy Club memorial, which was erected in 1999 at Cove on the southern shore, at the rocky mouth of the loch. Rain and wind, although thankfully not cold, set the scene. Decaying gun emplacements and pillboxes still litter the scene and remind us of the war days.</p><p>Recognition of the campaign, and of the few survivors still alive, has been sought for years. One campaigner, Commander Eddie Grenfell, who is originally from Peterhead, said:</p><p>&#8220;The campaign was also in a different geographical sphere with separate aims to the Battle of the Atlantic. I sailed in both campaigns and while the Battle of the Atlantic was tough, the Arctic campaign was unimaginably worse.&#8221;</p><p>Prior to winning power back in 1997, the Labour Party said that it would create an Arctic Star, only to refuse to allow any recognition and then eventually to grudgingly produce an Arctic Emblem in 2006, after a long campaign by veterans. However, when in opposition both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats also promised to create an Arctic Star. Defence minister Gerald Howarth has recently said that the idea would be included in a review of how medals are sanctioned. An early day motion by the Scottish National Party&#8217;s Westminster leader and defence spokesman, Angus Robertson, has been signed by 47 MPs from almost every political party in the House of Commons.</p><p>What better moment is there than now, the 70th anniversary of the convoys, to see such recognition brought about? As usual, the Ministry of Defence is dragging its feet, so, as others have said, the Prime Minister should personally intervene, knock heads together and announce the creation of a campaign medal without any further delay. A spokeswoman for the MOD said that the veterans would have to wait until later this year for the medal review to be completed.</p><p>Jock Dempster, chair of the Russian Convoy Club in Scotland, is also in the public gallery. He said:</p><p>&#8220;The problem is that the MoD have always dragged their feet&#8221;</p><p>because, he thinks, of suspicion between the United Kingdom and Russia. He continued:</p><p>&#8220;But actually the Arctic convoys should be used as a bridge to build friendship between us and Russia.&#8221;</p><p>In fact, the Russians have given Arctic veterans three memorial medals and regularly invite them as guests of honour to second world war commemorations and receptions, where they are f&#234;ted by the country&#8217;s leading politicians. Last year, the consul general of the Russian Federation in Edinburgh, Sergey Krutikov, honoured the veterans at a ceremony that I attended in Edinburgh. Jock Dempster said:</p><p>&#8220;The long-standing bond of friendship which existed between the Russian people and the veterans during the war has become even stronger since ... The Russians have never forgotten the ultimate sacrifice made by the 2,800 seamen who never returned to our shores.&#8221;</p><p>Two of my constituents, Sandy Manson from John o&#8217;Groats and Reay Clarke from Edderton, were present at Loch Ewe last month. Their stories, among many others, tell of the hardships and difficulties that people faced. Thirty merchant ships were escorted out of Loch Ewe, and Reay Clarke&#8217;s ship, the Farndale&#8212;he was an ordinary seaman&#8212;had to disengage from the convoy and head back to Scapa Flow, escorting a ship that had been damaged and could not make it as far as Murmansk. The Germans managed to sink 10 merchant ships out of the total of 40 that had gathered, and those crews were mostly lost.</p><p>The planned Russian Arctic convoy museum, which is to be set up at Aultbea, underlines the importance of highlighting the legacy of the world war two Russian Arctic convoys. Central to the project is the memory of all those brave men who sailed on the convoys and the many&#8212;perhaps more than 3,000&#8212;who lost their lives. The local communities in the north-west Highlands want to ensure that those men are remembered. They want people to contact the museum team to help with the project. I hope that Highland Council, the Scottish Government and the United Kingdom Government can help to create that lasting memorial to those people who gave so much for their country.</p><p>I lodged a motion of support for a permanent museum because I believe that that is the best way for us to recognise the Russian Arctic convoys, along with the veterans&#8217; receipt of medals in recognition of the awfulness and importance of the convoys. On 20 August, the convoys had the support of the international diplomatic corps and royal recognition. That gives a strong measure of justice to the memory of those brave seamen who ensured that our Russian allies could first resist and then open the second front to destroy the Nazi threat.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650809", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Remembering the Russian Arctic Convoys"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On 20 August this year, 300 people&#8212;veterans; families; supporters; Prince Michael of Kent; various diplomats, such as Sergey Krutikov, the consul general in Scotland for the Russian Federation, and a Norwegian diplomat; military attach\u00e9s from Canada and the USA; local dignitaries; sea scouts; sea cadets; local air cadets, who ably marshalled the traffic on narrow roads; the...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Gibson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80429", "house": "4", "member_id": "80429", "person_id": "13993", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Caithness, Sutherland and Ross"}, "section_id": "22650809", "hpos": "141", "gid": "2011-09-14.5.2", "epobject_id": "22650811", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2011-09-14.5.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13993+section%3Asp#g5.2", "minor": "0", "htime": null, "speaker_id": "80429"}, {"body": "<p>A bold and positive vision for the year ahead has been presented to us.

Scotland has a strong record of delivering on climate change and I am pleased to see further measures to help us meet our climate change targets. Our zero waste targets are ambitious but wholly achievable. By 2025 we aim to recycle 70 per cent of our waste, but we are only just beginning to catch up with the rest of Europe. Community-run organisations, such as Golspie Recycling and Environmental Action Network in my constituency, are leading the way by showing a better record of delivery than the local council, which is adopting policies of mixed waste, which can blight the example that has been set. There must be a proper relationship between local councils and the voluntary sector in order that such organisations&#8217; excellence is not lost. Sustainability and waste management go together.</p><p>In the opening part of my speech, I talked about the innovation element of the Government&#8217;s programme.

This flavour fortnight in Dumfries and Galloway has echoes across the country in ways in which funding sources are brought together, and local groups, who are so keen to start and develop, are supported.</p><p>In my constituency, the North Highland Initiative has grown from Prince Charles&#8217;s initiative using the Mey Selections brand and is able to bring together farmers, fine food producers and consumers, allowing them to access a range of goods than can be bought from within a 100-mile radius of the Castle of Mey. They include whisky, beef, lamb, tweed, oatcakes, shortbread, honey, fish and shellfish. I am sure that that echoes the range that is available in Dumfries and Galloway. Each area has the opportunity to find ways in which it can sell its goods to those who wish to buy.</p><p>The issues that are ahead of us relate to how to ensure that goods reach the widest market. Some producers are very small and can sell only very locally, but independent retail outlets are important at the early stages. Many more hotels and restaurants need to say in their menus that they use local produce. The North Highland Initiative has done a deal with Sainsbury&#8217;s to sell a prepared meal that includes beef from the north of Scotland, which gets to a huge audience. Local products deserve to reach such audiences.</p><p>The shellfish industry operates all round our coast, but particularly in the Highlands and Islands, and is a case in point. In 2010, Highland had 49 shellfish-growing businesses that employed 102 people, and Scotland had 164 such businesses. Initial sales, which include wild mussels that have been cared for, make the industry worth &#163;8.3&#160;million. The industry is small, but it is growing and is absolutely essential, because it is one of the cleanest uses of our seas.

Yesterday evening I attended a dinner with Asda, which has a very good policy for engaging with local suppliers&#8212;its supermarket engagement arrangement is perhaps the best, and other supermarkets should look at what it does. However, that does not suit everybody, as I said. Independent retailers are important, but on a large scale, Asda&#8212;which is a huge organisation&#8212;can sell products in one or two shops or in many. That part of the process will create even better support for our local produce.</p><p>We have a great opportunity to support the local foods of Dumfries and Galloway, which I hope I will manage to go and celebrate there.

We need to discuss how to deliver and what to deliver, and what partners to seek to enable us to do that.</p><p>When I was a Highlands and Islands member, I took a survey in the south of Orkney, around Invergordon and up in the north-west of Sutherland. I had a phenomenal response to the consultation in the north-west of Sutherland area&#8212;postcode IV27. Nearly a third of households responded, nearly half of which had used broadband for the purpose of both business and pleasure. They were among the most disadvantaged in the whole of the United Kingdom.</p><p>I am pleased that HIE won the competition to start to roll out next-generation broadband. In the Highlands and Islands project, next- generation broadband and points of presence should be made available to at least two towns in each local authority area by 2013. By 2014, there should be next generation broadband and points of presence in 50 towns and villages. By 2015, those 50 towns and exchange activate communities should be covered to within a 20km radius with about 2 megabits per second. By 2020, there should hopefully be next- generation broadband for all.</p><p>The &#163;10 million that HIE won will not cover that. In fact, the partnerships may have to release &#163;190 million more to be able to achieve some of those targets. What is the problem? We know that BT has 1,070 telephone exchanges in the country, which, with the exception of 21 exchanges in the Western Isles, offer wireless broadband services. However, 83 of the very small exchanges&#8212;many of them in the constituency that I represent&#8212;offer only a half a megabit service at present.</p><p>Since other exchanges can offer up to 8 megabits a second, we really need to ask whether the way in which the services for broadband are funded by consumers is fair. I have tackled BT about that matter. The situation is unfair on people who are getting half a megabit, because they have to pay the same as people who can get up to 8 megabits. BT needs to be held to account for taking people&#8217;s money under false pretences. British Telecom? It is only a bit of Britain, because a large part of the north has a very poor service indeed. Members should realise the urgency of what I have said. That urgency is recognised by our development agency, which realises that it has a huge job to do.</p><p>One woman told me, about her receipt of any kind of service, &#8220;I live at the end of a very thin copper wire.&#8221; That is a poignant little statement, but it is the experience of many people at the moment. We have to consider the partnerships that were formed in places such as Finland, which was mentioned earlier, in which local communities used their assets to roll out their own fibre in the areas beyond the points of presence that I mentioned earlier.</p><p>On the island of Eigg, it is possible to run electricity cables on the surface between the 30 or so houses because it is a small island with very little transport. We must find ways for people to lay their own cable if at all possible. The cable cannot be put underground that easily because, in many of the communities that I am talking about, there are no waste water or sewerage systems as there are in Dundee.</p><p>Why do we need to do that? The village in which I live is relatively near an exchange, and we can just about pick up the BBC iPlayer. That is the situation with the current broadband. We are saying that that ought to be not a gold standard, but a basic standard. It has to be delivered by landline because the satellite versions are too intermittent. We must know whether the money to deliver that kind of broadband will be made available in the schemes that have been mentioned, so we have to interrogate those schemes carefully to find out exactly what they will deliver. I suggest to members of all parties that we must find a way of asking the bodies that are bidding for the contracts that are being let in the period leading up to 2012 whether they will deliver that kind of service, or whether, as with the pathfinder, some of the services will be delivered by satellite because some places do not have proper telephone services.</p><p>We have to look to BT to find more money for the process because, for a long time, it has been taking money from people who are not getting the service that BT advertises. We also have to find other partners to do that.</p><p>As we look at the Government&#8217;s proposed community empowerment and renewal bill, I suggest that we also look at communities that have assets such as benefits from wind farms to see whether they might act as partners with others to create the access to broadband that we know they deserve and require.

The &#8220;Speak Up for Rural Scotland&#8221; consultation and the Government&#8217;s response to it pose a lot of choices. We need to crystallise the best options and take action.</p><p>It is to be noted that the Westminster Scottish Affairs Committee inquiry into the Crown Estate is in Scotland this week. The committee says that it wants to hear from communities what they want from Crown Estate reform, but it must not rule out this Parliament&#8217;s right to decide the structure and role of such a body. The UK Parliament, after all, did nothing to review the Crown Estate&#8217;s role until the SNP raised the stakes.</p><p>I hope that, across the parties, we want as many communities as possible to benefit from abolishing this stealth tax gatherer. Developers need to be involved and need to support local communities, and those who deliver marine renewables need to include coastal communities in sharing the profits.</p><p>A fortnight ago I launched CALL&#8212;the Coigach and Assynt living landscape project&#8212;with partners including the Assynt Foundation, the Culag Community Woodland Trust and the owners of Tanera Mor island and the neighbouring estate of Eisg Brachaid, along with the John Muir Trust and the Scottish Wildlife Trust. CALL sets out to measure and improve biodiversity and human involvement to make the area far more sustainable in this climate change era.</p><p>Twenty years ago, local Wester Ross ecologist Bernard Planterose recognised that reforestation, beyond conservation, embraced wildlife conservation and the various present-day land uses, as well as the future re-inhabitation of the land and expansion of the productive natural resource base. As such, he said, it exhibits ecological, economic and political strands.</p><p>Today, we value trees and people, jobs and peatland rewetting, local energy production and biodiversity even more. I am delighted that a measurable project with a 50-year time span has been set up in Coigach and Assynt so as to set an example across the country. It fits the thrust of Scottish Government policy and is a practical way to link the environment and the people who live there and to enable them to plan a brighter future.</p><p>In Scotland, we cannot achieve food security at the expense of the food security of other peoples on other continents. We have to look at the carbon footprint of expensive inputs, such as potash, nitrate and soya feed for our animals.</p><p>There are no shortcuts to feed the world. Instead, we must support the local farming industries of each country&#8212;in our case, we have our deep knowledge and science to back them up. The multinational biotech industry&#8217;s much-hyped genetically modified crops have been an expensive failure. Local crops and local markets are the key to success, not free markets as demanded by the World Trade Organization. It is the EU CAP that protects the quality and local production of our food.</p><p>In that context, we will have the report about the CAP in October. The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee will give it a high priority when there are some proposals on the table to discuss; it will not be swept under the carpet, as some people erroneously seem to have said. The CAP must continue to support production here in Scotland, which has a proud record of food and drink production and sales. The UK ambivalence to home production must not prevail.</p><p>We want and need to boost the value of Scottish branded produce, which has been so successful under the SNP Government. Labelling and provenance are key demands of consumers, and we can achieve them through the mixed, family-farming base of our Scottish industry. That is why a thorough measure of land reform, growing community assets, improving the biodiversity of huge skelps of the land of this nation and creating food security are all components of a successful and sustainable land use strategy, which we can build in this session of Parliament.

I ask members to cast their minds back to a report of 5 October last year on the views of the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets, which said that &#163;32 billion of new infrastructure was needed in Britain to carry electricity here, there and everywhere. The report said:</p><p>&#8220;Gas and electricity charges will have to rise by an average of &#163;6 per household a year over the next 10 years&#8221;.</p><p>We have to recognise that in the past energy was paid for directly through taxation and people did not notice the way in which the infrastructure was built. We are now in an age when private companies build infrastructure and seek finance out in the open. We also have to recognise that the replacement of fossil fuel production with the new energies will have an up-front cost. That is the difficulty from the point of view of dealing with fuel poverty and what people have to pay. The green investment bank is part of the argument about how we can get the job done.</p><p>When we took up the case for the green investment bank, we witnessed arguments with the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has made large investments in energy, although mainly in coal, oil and tar sands around the world, rather than in the renewable energies in Scotland&#8212;or Britain, for that matter. The argument for the green investment bank was that there had to be a publicly led bank that, working on sound banking principles, was able to ensure that we had sources of cash for renewable energies and could draw in cash from other banks, so that we could have the kind of investment that I am talking about.</p><p>Just this week, we have seen news about rebranding and sales in relation to SeaEnergy, which has partners for offshore wind farms in the Moray Firth and off Inch Cape. One of the points made in the recent stories about SeaEnergy&#8217;s recent sale is that:</p><p>&#8220;The sale took a year to secure and came after SeaEnergy said it couldn&#8217;t obtain the necessary funding to develop the three-year-old business.&#8221;</p><p>The point about getting the funding for offshore wind production is obvious: there has to be a source of funding that is sensible and available sooner rather than later.</p><p>We have a financial services hub in the centre of Scotland that has built up despite the recession and which has 300-year-old skills behind it. American firms are moving in here at a time when we are in the process of moving out of the recession&#8212;asset managers, insurance and other financial services have also been mentioned. We must build on that belief in Edinburgh as a financial hub to ensure that the investments provide a good return and that Scotland and the rest of Britain get a good return on the development of renewable energies.</p><p>There is an awful lot to say on this subject. As a north of Scotland member, I am delighted to recognise that we are looking to the green investment bank to provide the bridge towards securing the funds that will help develop the Moray Firth renewables scheme, the Beatrice offshore wind farm, the development at Inch Cape and so on. In the Scottish context, it is vital that the Edinburgh case is made. I hope that it has every success. It has had my support from the start and it has cross-party support.

Renewable capacity equivalent to 100% of gross demand is perfectly possible by 2020 as part of a wider energy mix.</p><p>This will mean thousands of jobs, particularly in marine energy. Achieving this target requires both determination and leadership&#8221;.</p><p>That was said by Jim McColl of Clyde Blowers, who is among the very people who will be leading the industrial effort to deliver and achieve the tasks that are required.</p><p>The scale of the task is indeed huge; as has been stated by everyone, the scale of the opportunity is also huge. As the member for Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, in the north of Scotland, part of my duty is to ensure that we gain benefits in our area from developments in this field. In the first instance, they will come from proven technology. I refer, for example, to the Moray Offshore Renewables project. Before 2020, 200 turbines will be producing energy equivalent to that of a nuclear power station. If we are talking about 1,500MW by 2020, we are talking about our country having the capacity to replace that amount of energy using proven technology within that timescale. That kind of opportunity is achievable, and it can bring huge amounts of work to areas close to where I live.</p><p>In order to achieve that, we need a stable market. Germany is saying to its utilities&#8212;E.ON, RWE and so on&#8212;&#8220;You have renewables arms, which have to be stepped up.&#8221; That is the signal that I take from Germany. Such arms will back up our efforts to make changes in Scotland and those technologies are adding to our native wit and our ability to do the job that I laid out. The utilities can help to create a stable market, because we need the finance so that we can get into renewables&#8212;members mentioned the green investment bank and other members will do so. We are talking about a huge amount of money, but the important point is that if it is directed in the right fashion, there will be opportunities&#8212;for example, from the development of the deepwater offshore wind farms&#8212;to sell the technology on in the world. Indeed, the east of the United States and the east of Brazil are waiting for such work to be proven.</p><p>There are two turbines, 12 miles off the Caithness coast, which I have seen throughout the time that I have represented the Highlands and Islands region and now my constituency. They have been proven to work. There will be 200 such turbines in the first phase. That is a huge undertaking, of course, but it is no more difficult to achieve than building a nuclear power station in the same time would be, and it is far more sustainable. The route map or road map&#8212;whatever name we adopt&#8212;will include such proven technology.</p><p>We have to deal with regulators that are run from London&#8212;the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets, in particular. Ofgem says:</p><p>&#8220;Our principal duty is to protect the interests of existing and future consumers.&#8221;</p><p>That is exactly what the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy is about. It is about ensuring that we have the electricity to be able to support people in the poorest conditions, in industry and so on. Ofgem says that its aims are about</p><p>&#8220;promoting security of supply, promoting sustainable development&#8221;,</p><p>and dealing with the problems of &#8220;vulnerable consumers&#8221;. That is exactly what the Scottish Government&#8217;s ambition is about, so we must ensure that we get Ofgem on our side so that we can achieve those things.</p><p>We also need Ofgem to change its approach to renewables obligations. Will the minister comment, if possible, on how renewables obligation certificates are used in relation to power stations that burn timber? That is not renewable energy&#8212;although the timber is replaceable. A practice that is currently being supported is having a serious effect on our country&#8217;s forests and timber supply, and we need to consider the issue carefully.</p><p>I am taking on a new role in the Parliament&#8217;s Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee and it is obvious that issues to do with the balance between how we generate electricity and how we conserve it will be important to us. We will also have the annual round of work on the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.</p><p>I have much sympathy with the Association for the Conservation of Energy, which says that</p><p>&#8220;Improved demand reduction will require a lower surcharge on electricity bills&#8221;</p><p>and is calling for a 12 per cent reduction in electricity demand by 2020, in line with the Government&#8217;s overall energy demand reduction target, so that we can have much more resilient homes. We must put in place smart metering, so that individuals and families can think about how they use electricity and decide to use it more efficiently. I look forward to opportunities cropping up in that regard.</p><p>The report, &#8220;The Power of Scotland Secured&#8221;, summed up the issue very well when it said that its conclusions</p><p>&#8220;depend on only moderate efficiency and conservation achievements, below the targets set by the Scottish Government. More ambitious energy demand reductions across all sectors would make system security and emissions reductions far easier and cheaper to deliver, and would reduce household fuel bills.&#8221;</p><p>The Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee will carefully consider all the aspects.

I welcome you to your role. I also welcome Neil Bibby&#8217;s speech on the interests of young people and the people of West Scotland in general. We all have so much in common. These must be regarded as some of the most exciting times in which to represent our constituents; I certainly think so in relation to my constituents in the north Highlands.</p><p>I pay tribute to Jamie Stone and John Farquhar Munro, who represented two constituencies of which parts make up the Caithness, Sutherland and Ross constituency. They played a full part in the first 12 years of the Parliament and I hope to follow on from their legacy and to do even better for the constituents that I represent. That is a great honour, indeed.</p><p>We can see the lucrative opportunities that need to be grasped now to get Scotland and the Highlands working better. The newly re-elected Scottish Government has the vision and determination to make the most of the opportunities ahead and to improve life in the Highlands and throughout the country. Nearly 50 per cent of my constituents voted for that vision to be achieved.</p><p>We in the north have not always had a fair deal in the past. However, with a rejuvenated political representation and a Government on our side, we can turn those problems of the past into Highland opportunities to benefit the whole of Scotland&#8212;not least in deep-seated land reform.</p><p>The SNP Government&#8217;s ambitious commitment to renewable energy will be a key plank in securing future prosperity in the Highlands. We must do everything that we can to reindustrialise the Highlands and to make the most of the underused but world-class facilities that are on our doorstep. To the east of my constituency lies Nigg yard on the Cromarty Firth. Having been mothballed for years, that world-class fabrication yard is due to get back on its feet this year and has the potential to create more than 1,000 new jobs in the north. Over in Wester Ross lies Kishorn port&#8212;a fantastic facility that will in the future launch Atlantic offshore wind turbine towers made of concrete. In the north lie Scrabster harbour and Wick, which will both kick start the marine industry boom in the north of Scotland. Those facilities offer exciting job prospects and energy developments for the north. I call them a Highland golden triangle&#8212;from Caithness to Wester Ross to Easter Ross.</p><p>In Scotland, we are blessed with talent and the resources to research, develop, build and launch the onshore and offshore devices that will power our country in the years to come. Not only are we building the energy devices of the future, we are building the foundations of a new job security and of prosperity. Right at the heart of the Government&#8217;s vision is the creation of jobs that will allow lives to escape from the awful experiences of recession and youth poverty that have been mentioned.</p><p>Such ambitious projects require a Government that shares that ambition. We are ambitious for Scotland because we have faith in the country&#8217;s capacity to govern itself and to do it a whole lot better than has been done for us in London in the past. We are ambitious to ensure that such simple things as the fossil fuel levy are returned immediately to kick start our renewable enterprises.</p><p>I have set out the positive difference that a renewable energy revolution can make for Scotland. However, without the urgent devolution of the Crown estate, those opportunities will be missed. As my colleague Joan McAlpine mentioned, many members will be familiar with the views of people across the Parliament on the matter. I have been saying since the 1970s that we need to control the Crown estate in Scotland.</p><p>To the vast majority of those who are trying to improve Scotland&#8217;s land and seas, the Crown Estate looms like a medieval robber baron rubbing his hands with glee at the potential of the offshore wealth that it seeks to plunder. Those are not my words, initially, but those of constituents who see the organisation in that fashion. However, I believe that &#8220;plunder&#8221; is the most appropriate word.</p><p>In its current form, the Crown Estate is no better than the mischief-making characters in &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221;. The Crown Estate Commissioners look to the potential of areas such as the Pentland Firth and the Cromarty Firth and all they see is pound signs&#8212;not for the community and not even for Scotland, but for their coffers, down in London. Such is their lack of interest in community benefit that they appear to be about to abolish the post of wave and tidal project manager from Caithness, the area where we most need to develop such energy.</p><p>We need folk in the Crown Estate who are grounded in local communities, not only in Caithness, Sutherland or Ross-shire, but in every part of Scotland. I heard much about localism being bandied about during the election campaign. Scattered small communities, such as those that I represent, are close knit, and each faces unique challenges and opportunities. Currently, those communities are not best served by the size of our more rural mainland local authorities, such as the Highland Council. Small communities have little influence over local decisions in their areas, which makes for poor local government.</p><p>To my mind, localism is about doing what I admit I have just been doing, which is moaning about a situation. What we need is local control and decentralisation of power. I therefore look forward to working with the Government and with councillor colleagues during this session to put communities in charge of local priorities, because when communities take responsibility, they reap the rewards.</p><p>Our energy ambition will deliver a Highland solution to Highland job shortages. The devolution of the Crown estate will allow Highland communities to reap the maximum benefit from our land and territorial waters. The decentralisation of basic local services will empower Highland communities to make life better, because they know best. I am looking forward to shaping the new Highlands, one that works to make the area attractive for investment and to make life easier for people there.

Having been on the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee for the past four years, I am well aware that we can probably make the best progress on better regulation and the integration of services.</p><p>If you do not mind, Presiding Officer, I will stray slightly from the subject of debate. In many places, bus, rail, ferry and air services are not often linked up. In my region, it is very important that they are. Part of the problem is the different regulatory arrangement for each of those modes of transport. In looking forward, we need to find a much better way in which to do that job. The committee has said so, but I have not heard a call for better regulation of that sort reflected in the debate and yet the issue affects many of my constituents across the Highlands and Islands, and far wider than that.</p><p>Another set of better regulation that has to be worked in relates to commercial bus transport providers and other needs in my area. As the &#8220;Our Rural Future&#8221; report that has just been published points out:</p><p>&#8220;In rural areas, Demand Responsive and Community Transport can be vital transport services, and we would encourage Local Authorities to look proactively at enhancing both the provision and the coordination of existing schemes.&#8221;</p><p>As we have heard, the removal of ring fencing and the transfer of responsibility to local authorities means that they can choose not to make such transport a priority. In my area, Highland Council has seen a reduction over the past couple of years but it has chosen to spend around &#163;50,000 on community transport. If community transport is seen as a priority for improvement, it ought to be given a higher priority than that.</p><p>Our circumstances in the Highlands require integration between commercial services, community services and ambulance services. The Scottish Ambulance Service provides both emergency response and patient transport services. I see a lot of friction between community transport needs and patient transport requirements. The health service should look to see whether patient transport services to Raigmore hospital from outlying places should carry other passengers, too. In that way it would be possible for people to get the transport that they require, which is being denied to them at the moment because of the way in which the local authority has cut its community transport budget. That should be possible, because there are collaborations between the health service and the local authority social work department to deal with adult and old age needs under the aegis of NHS Highland. However, the Ambulance Service does not articulate with Highland Council, NHS Highland or whatever. I ask the minister to start to look at that with his colleagues.</p><p>Changes to bus timetables have caused a lot of pain in the far north of the Highlands. However, Brian Souter has described those services as marginally successful, and one can understand why. Petrol and diesel prices are very much higher in Highland where longer distances are involved and fuel is more expensive, particularly following the increase in VAT. There are real problems around the distances involved, and certain places are being cut out in order for bus services to meet any kind of timetable that matches the rail timetable.</p><p>In the village that I live in, which is only 17 miles away from Inverness, we have been threatened with a reduction in services because of time and other constraints that relate to long-distance routes from Caithness, namely the X99 and the 25X. It is ridiculous for people who live in a village about 6 miles away from Dingwall to find that, if they want to go to Dingwall on a Saturday&#8212;for example, to attend a football match at Ross County&#8212;it will take them six or seven hours to travel to the game, watch the game and return home. That is the sort of ridiculous situation that we are dealing with at present, but it is the kind of situation that the commercial bus companies must listen to.</p><p>I am delighted that, because Stagecoach is attempting to make its services more economic, as today&#8217;s announcement states,</p><p>&#8220;13,800 Stagecoach drivers will start using the GreenRoad system&#8221;</p><p>and will get bonuses for driving better and using less fuel. I would like some of its competitors to commit to the same scheme, to reduce the cost of diesel and, perhaps, the price of fares. On top of that, it is vitally important, when we talk about buses, that the fuel duty regulator and the derogation for rural areas should kick in. With the rising price of diesel in peak oil times, we do not have the means to sustain community transport, ambulance services or commercial vehicles. We should widen out the debate and look at the issue in that context. The future of regulation should be better regulation, not more of it.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22646916", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bus Services Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "For the avoidance of doubt, the question of bus regulation was not ever in the SNP manifesto.

We want to ensure that there is transparency and that communities of all sizes are served by the proposals. I am the person who is arguing for those things. On Monday, at a national health service board meeting that was called to discuss that, no Liberal Democrat was present. Yet again, the Lib Dems talk about protecting communities, but they do not attend the meetings at which such issues are discussed. That happens a lot. Like other health boards, NHS Highland needs to be watched. I would like the health board to be more accountable, but we have to have the argument about how that can happen.</p><p>I want to talk about the police service&#8217;s views. In a letter to me, the assistant secretary of the northern branch of the Scottish Police Federation said:</p><p>&#8220;Every effort must be made to ensure that whatever the resultant structures the people who have elected you to represent them are afforded representation which is in their best interests to ensure current service provision is maintained and protected.&#8221;</p><p>My view is that the area commanders should be responsible, on a six-weekly basis, to local area committees of elected unitary authority councillors. The police board is one eighth of councillors, but all councillors should be involved. While that goes on, the area inspector can be attending a community council meeting in Wick and discussing vandalism, boy racers and issues related to closed circuit television. That would not stop. It is the kind of activity that goes on now&#8212;it will continue and is not threatened. However, if we were to listen to the Liberal Democrats, we would believe that that is precisely the kind of activity that the proposals for a modern police service would threaten. Not at all.</p><p>The debate is about how to deal with the modern police service. The police need to be able to deploy methods that are suitable for the type of crimes that specific areas face. Smaller police forces need to call in specialists for particular activities. Northern Constabulary has to pay for armed officers when the royal family are in our area. Part of the problem is that, in small communities, we need to find economies of scale. We need a debate on the services that people want from the police in the future, but that debate is not part of the Liberal Democrats&#8217; propaganda exercise ahead of the election. They claim that they will protect communities and that everybody else is against that. The substance of my argument is that that is not true.</p><p>With budgets being slashed, we have to ask how the morale of the police will be affected by the United Kingdom measures to cut the employer&#8217;s contribution to police pensions by making police pay more for their pensions. That undermining of morale is happening in police services throughout Britain as a result of measures by the Liberal Democrat-Conservative Government in London.

The creation of the society was a remarkable event, which was based on the idea that solidarity between those who live together can be developed for their best interests and those of their families and the community in which they live. Indeed, the weavers society served as a model for others in more industrial communities and, as we know, the idea spread to many parts of the world.</p><p>It is interesting to consider the Fenwick weavers in the context of how people respond to crises, because the issues that they faced in the 1760s were a Britain at war and a Scottish economy that was affected by import restrictions and so on, which was also very much the experience of Robert Burns slightly later. In the end, they, too, supported emigration to try to free themselves from the yoke that they were under, which is what Robert Burns wrote about in trying to show up the landlords who tried to stop people escaping from that kind of oppression.</p><p>That situation happened again and again. Indeed, the kind of communities that Robert Owen was involved in setting up in the new world, in Pennsylvania, and those that Welsh idealistic socialists set up in Patagonia were very much in the tradition of trying to create a co-operative community that could stand up for itself and make its way in the world.</p><p>The Fenwick idea has had many elaborations in later times, not the least of which, as is mentioned in the motion, is the Mondragon Corporation. It was founded in the wreckage and carnage of the Spanish civil war in the Basque Country in an area that had been devastated economically and had a closed economic system. Don Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a Arizmendiarrieta got together some young men, who got themselves a technical education and, in 1956, became involved in the production of&#8212;I understand&#8212;small heaters of German origin. As the process developed, they created their own bank, social security, colleges and universities. Today, there are 256 co-operatives in the Mondragon Corporation, which have worldwide reach.</p><p>Don Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a recognised that innovation and education were at the heart of the movement, as I guess the Fenwick weavers did. He said:</p><p>&#8220;However splendid the present might be, it is destined to fail if it turns its back on the future.&#8221;</p><p>He thought that, through co-operation and solidarity, innovation would enable workers to meet the challenges of the ever-changing world. That is a huge testament to the ideas that began in Fenwick so many years earlier and were carried forward elsewhere in Scotland and in England.</p><p>I am delighted to support whole-heartedly the motion and an idea in which I have been interested for 30 years.

For example, there is no central database covering reservoirs in Scotland. Currently, each of the 32 local authorities in Scotland is responsible for regulating the reservoirs in its area, which has led to a fragmented and inconsistent approach to record keeping and enforcement across the country. However, given the fact that we are in the business of making sure that registration leads to regulation, we must be careful that the bill does not add to the costs of reservoir owners and users. At the same time, we should not increase the bureaucracy that is likely to arise from classification, enforcement and giving advice.</p><p>We all recognise that the committee&#8217;s work on the bill has been carried out with a desire to ensure that people are safe, that the reservoir structures, which are quite old, are well maintained and that we can find ways in which to incorporate reservoirs as a natural part of how Scotland looks. We must recognise that, although some of their uses have changed, reservoirs are very much a part of the landscape of Scotland.</p><p>Concerns about flooding and the potential for breaches in dams cannot be too far from the minds of those of us in the Highlands. For example, anyone who drives on the road between Dingwall and Ullapool and passes Loch Glascarnoch dam&#8212;one of the great hydro dams of the 1950s&#8212;will recognise that the houses and the inn at Aultguish that are just below the dam are in the kind of place that Peter Peacock talked about, which was not covered by detailed planning regulations when the dam was constructed. I am not saying for one minute that there are dangers in the structures there, as they are well maintained, but it is important to recognise that there has to be a clear understanding in civil engineering terms of the capacity of the relevant dams.</p><p>The fact that the bill will increase the number of dams that Scottish and Southern Energy has responsibility for from 80 to 90 means that the structure of and safety issues around more and more structures will be examined. I welcome that. Most people recognise, when they drive along the roads, that a lot of the structures are quite old, and we all hope that they are maintained in the best possible fashion.</p><p>It is interesting that people are creating new dams. I want to speak about an example of one such dam, although I am not sure whether I can confirm that it is the size of four Olympic swimming pools. Last summer, Lighthouse Caledonia, one of Europe&#8217;s leading producers of farmed salmon, wanted to safeguard water supplies to its salmon hatchery at Loch Carron, on the Applecross peninsula, and lower rainfall meant that it wanted to increase the size of the reservoir by 30 per cent. It was able to carry out the necessary work, including the installation of a new pipe system, in six weeks. It is a fairly small dam, but it has an effect on the areas around it, and its environmental impact will be measured. I am delighted that it will be possible for us to ask SEPA to consider such developments, as the relevant parliamentary committee in future will be able to consider how the process of regulation, registration and enforcement is taken forward. The bill will allow that to happen, and I am delighted that we will be able to place something on the statute book before the end of March&#8212;I hope&#8212;that will be of use to many people across the country.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As we know, the Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill is a technical bill that has been drawn up through need.

The potential dangers of those cuts are considerable. The package of maritime cuts in the north and west that is being brokered by the UK Government is completely unacceptable and may put lives at risk.</p><p>We have already heard about the results of the decision to remove the tugs. Many leading members of the military have complained about the virtual closure of RAF Kinloss. As is noted in a letter from leading members of the military in The Daily Telegraph today, the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft that co-ordinate air-sea rescue from up on top are based at RAF Kinloss. They are a part of the package that is being scrapped to save money, we are told. The decision could affect many facets of life in the north and west of Scotland&#8212;and beyond. Tourism, trade, the environment and the way of life are in real danger if the cuts in coastguard provision are carried out.</p><p>In the future, with the opening up of the north-west and north-east passages, with oilfields opening in the Atlantic and the offshore renewables revolution, the seas around the north and west coasts of Scotland will likely see a vast increase in shipping. There is therefore a strong case for expanding the existing coastguard bases in Stornoway and Lerwick, not cutting them.</p><p>The idea of part-time stations that work in daylight hours is interesting. At the winter solstice there are around six hours of daylight in Shetland and Lewis, but during the summer solstice that figure rises to over 18 hours in both places. It is incredible that there is no explanation in any of the papers that I could find of what is meant by daylight hours. It has just not been thought through.</p><p>There have been high-profile maritime disasters in the area. The Braer disaster off Shetland was a horrendous event that led to tugs such as the Anglian Prince, as was, and the Jambo, off Wester Ross, being stationed where they are. The effects of such disasters have been greatly mitigated by having on-the-spot coastguard control.</p><p>Ports across the north of Scotland are seeing an expansion of liner traffic, for example, and there is the possibility of more ship-to-ship transfers because of the opening up of the north-east and north-west passages round the Arctic. I suggest that the whole story of the economic potential and the life of the area has not been taken into account in the decision to close the coastguard stations.</p><p>I suggest that the Parliament thank Alasdair Allan for securing the debate and ensure that we make it clear, with a united voice, that everything about the economy and life of the north-west of Scotland will be severely affected by the move to close the coastguard stations.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643628", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Coastguard Centre Cuts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I am a member who represents the whole of the Highlands and Islands, I am acutely aware of the need for a full package of services to protect all uses of our seas and coastlines.

I thank fellow committee members and all those organisations that gave the committee evidence that provided us with a global viewpoint. It has been an important and useful debate, ranging from the north-east passage to pandas. It has not always been cuddly, but it has definitely been consensual.</p><p>Members will be pleased to hear that I do not want to repeat all that the convener said in his opening remarks, but I reiterate that the background to the committee&#8217;s inquiry into international trade was to provide assurance that, in these times of strained public sector budgets, the public sector was providing the best possible suite of services to the business community to help it to trade internationally and to attract new business to Scotland. Members were well aware that Scotland has a tremendous track record of punching above its weight on these matters.</p><p>Some comments strayed far back into the past. The references to Darien and so on were interesting, but we should not forget that some of the first wealth was created from the slave trade and slave labour. There are many things to be learned from the way in which some of the companies that we exported went on to found globalisation, by moving from Hong Kong to Bermuda when times got difficult for the Hong Kong base. The global world in which we must work is a highly competitive place. Our home base is important to us as part of that story.</p><p>We took a great deal of evidence from many successful companies that are already exporting worldwide. In particular, I recall hearing from large and small companies about how bodies such as SDI have helped them. There are tremendous entrepreneurial spirits in firms such as Lossie Seafoods Ltd and Mackays of Arbroath, the jam manufacturers, whose representatives impressed us all with their zeal to sell their goods around the world as a way of breaking out of becoming prisoners of the large supermarkets. By their enterprise to globalise, they have shown the way.</p><p>The food and drink sector is one of Scotland&#8217;s expanding success stories. In my region, the Highlands and Islands, there are many examples of firms that are excellent at exporting and of our supporting foreign firms to come to Scotland. This very day, we have heard from Highlands and Islands Enterprise about LifeScan&#8217;s fantastic story of expansion in the Inverness area, which was helped by SDI and HIE.</p><p>VisitScotland has great opportunities to rebuild something that has been missing during the downturn&#8212;business tourism. We need large numbers of businesspeople to come here and understand what our opportunities are. Out of the top 20 places to visit, National Geographic Traveler magazine mentioned the Highlands as the world&#8217;s number 2 tourism destination. Businesspeople have a great opportunity to come to the Highlands to see our culture, history and scenery and, I would add, to take in the potential for export.</p><p>It is important to dwell on some oil and gas history. To begin with, the sector in the North Sea took a while to become a base for exporting technology and know-how. I am sure that it will be the same with the renewables industry, but it is important to recognise that Mitsubishi, through its partnership and its move into Scotland, has already shown that foreign inward investment can once again step in to help one of our fantastic growth industries. I expect some massive developments in knowledge and techniques in the export of renewables over the next five to 10 years.</p><p>It is a highly competitive world. During the committee&#8217;s inquiry, we received information at first hand from Flemish, Catalan and North Rhine-Westphalia development organisations. It was important to see how they did things. One thing that I learned from the German visit and from speaking to the Flemish people was that their development people need to speak to ours a good deal more often. We spent some time saying to our people that they must speak to their development officers to secure some links so that we can find ways for synergies to take place, as Christopher Harvie mentioned. The committee heard from consular representatives from Iceland, Switzerland and Hungary, as well as from the Germans. That was very useful, as it raised the whole question of doing business with those places.</p><p>It is not simply the case that English is the best language to use. We have to speak some French, and we certainly need some German for dealing with two of our major trade partners. We cannot ignore that when it comes to the teaching of those subjects in our schools.</p><p>I read in a recent edition of the New Statesman that it is believed that China is spending about &#163;12 billion per month on developing and improving its renewable energy sector. In addition to what I said earlier about the involvement of Mitsubishi with renewables here, that is why we need to drive forward the development of Scotland&#8217;s renewable energy industry and infrastructure, aiming in particular at the Chinese market&#8212;&#163;12 billion a month is an eye-watering amount.</p><p>I hope that there will be movement on port and harbour developments in my part of the world, so that we can retain our place at the forefront, as leading developers of marine energy systems. That is a part of the job that our internal economic development and enterprise agencies must see to, but they are assisted by SDI providing potential agents to help us.</p><p>One of the best examples of synergy between SDI and the private sector lies in the smart exporter programme, which was mentioned by a number of members. Primarily run by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce as a joint venture with SDI and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, smart exporter provides a lot of companies with the first step to understanding how to go about things. I enjoyed the exchange about the relationship between the smart exporter programme and my own area in the Highlands&#8212;it is an all-Scotland activity.</p><p>Members have made a lot of good comments in the debate, and we will be able to read them again in the Official Report. It is time, however, to draw the debate to a close. Robert Burns was mentioned earlier and we should note that, in one of his more depressed moods, in &#8220;Strathallan&#8217;s Lament&#8221;, he said:</p><p>&#8220;The wide world is all before us&#8212;</p><p>But a world without a friend!&#8221;</p><p>I agree with the first part of that, but Scotland is the world&#8217;s friend. Our culture and verse is universally loved. Now, with our wonderful food, drink and environmentally friendly technologies, there is much that the world&#8217;s friend can offer. The committee&#8217;s report deserves members&#8217; support.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22642741", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Report on the public sector&#8217;s support for exporters, international trade and the attraction of inward investment&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in this debate.

The Scottish approach is summed up in the suite of papers entitled \"Scotland&#8212;A Low Carbon Society\". It involves the opportunity for us to take an integrated approach to the production, supply and sale of electricity and to other carbon reduction measures. Previous speakers have mentioned the need for stability for developers and producers. We must see some opportunity in the system to assure consumers that the prices that they pay do not vary throughout the country for any unnecessary reason. The regulators must ensure that the environment benefits from the decisions that they take.</p><p>The Scottish Government's suite of papers&#8212;the draft electricity generation policy statement and so on&#8212;shows that the low-carbon society that we envisage is based on our ability to produce some of the cleanest power in the world, without any of the hangover of nuclear waste or of issues that relate to that, which have yet to be solved.</p><p>Feed-in tariffs have been mentioned in the debate about how to encourage renewable electricity generation. I am sure that many members will mention such tariffs. The consultation paper suggests that such financial support will also be made available to nuclear power developments. If a two-way process is to take place between the UK Government and the Scottish Government, and if Scotland's Parliament is determined to take a particular approach, I am concerned that quite a strong firewall will have to exist between the methods of support for renewables and those for nuclear, if support is needed for that in England. I will not argue about that today, but that is important.</p><p>The National Grid owns and operates the high-voltage electricity transmission network in England and Wales and operates the system throughout Great Britain. Whether that private company <place-holder colnum=\"32226\"/> provides the appropriate model for running our transmission of electricity has not been discussed. Given the moneys that will be required to upgrade the grid, I wonder whether we can rely on the profits that the National Grid makes in the north-east of the United States or whether we should find a more substantial way of supporting the grid. I would like there to be some reflection on that issue because we have been presented with a Thatcherite model. Although such a model has been rejected when it comes to locational charging, we have not yet addressed why the grid should be run by that kind of private company. I would like the minister to talk about that when he responds to the debate.</p><p>Market and regulatory reform will be required for electricity developments that, in some cases, will take 10 to 15 years to achieve. The development of wave and tidal energy has been mentioned, and Gavin Brown mentioned the opportunities in the Pentland Firth. There are also opportunities in many other, smaller areas, such as the one between Islay and Jura. We must have some certainty that, beyond 2017, there will be a stable regime that allows such developments to happen, because the 2017 timescale could well be too short for some of the commercial-scale developments. We must start the process early, so we must have a system that allows for that.</p><p>Among the matters that might be more pertinent to Ofgem, but which feed into the electricity market debate, is the fact that only five of the 27 EU member states apply network charges on the locational basis that we do, and that Britain has the widest range of intra-country charges and the highest locational charges in Europe. If the electricity market is to benefit producers and consumers, we will have to measure its success against developments in Europe. Jim Mather mentioned Georg Adamowitsch's report and the need for a vast European infrastructure. If the electricity market reform does not slot into that, we will miss a trick, given our ability to export into that much wider market. I hope that it will be possible for our ministers to hold serious discussions with their counterparts in London about that.</p><p>I have two more brief points to make. First, good will and collaboration are required. They were not evident when the port development fund was restricted to English ports in the autumn and the Scottish Government was required to provide for Scottish ports. If we want there to be good will and collaboration, that will have to work both ways. Secondly, the fossil fuel levy, the funds from which the majority of members of the Scottish Parliament believe are required now, should be released in a form that can be used. We must keep up the campaign for that.<place-holder colnum=\"32227\"/></p><p>Finally, the ROCs supported the production of hydroelectricity, but some tweaking is required so that we can increase the amount of hydro that is available in the power stations in which they have been used. If possible, I would like the minister to address that issue when he closes the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21178165", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electricity Market Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to participate in the debate.

We must throw that back at the NGOs and the other parties in the Parliament and say, \"If we had the money from the fossil fuel levy, for example, which we have been denied for three years, would that allow us to invest in lower-carbon activity?\" If people are in a policy bubble in which they think that they can quickly take things forward in the direction of low carbon without having the money to do it, they are in Alice in Wonderland territory. That is why we must temper our remarks about many things in this debate.</p><p>We should also consider one or two aspects with regard to relationships and what COSLA should be doing. Local authorities are also under the cosh as far as money is concerned, but their attitude is important. A more fundamental use of the single outcome agreements would involve measuring local authorities' activities to see that they measure up in carrying out the actions that we wish them to. Local authorities must develop that over time. In Germany, for example, the buy-in to a lower-carbon economy has taken place over a period of 20 years. We have to catch up, but we must recognise that, although people start to behave differently when they begin to buy in, it does not happen overnight. We have made a start with the draft RPP, but we recognise that we need to create the conditions for that buy-in.</p><p>The land use strategy, which has been mentioned, is perhaps the very first attempt to have such a strategy. It is not as strong as I would like it to be, but I recognise the difficulties, and the work that our civil service&#8212;which is, again, constrained by time and numbers&#8212;has put into it.</p><p>As a result of campaigning by us and the Government, along with many others, the Kyoto protocol on national accounting for land management, which now includes the rewetting of peatlands, was agreed at Canc&#250;n. The measurement will be voluntary over the next couple of years, but it could add to the potential for reducing our carbon output. Unlike Jackson Carlaw, I do not view that as an alternative. It is not an either/or&#8212;we have to do it. We have to find the money from somewhere to dam the drains in peatland areas and restore the peat. If we find a budget for it, the huge return that was identified in the International Union for Conservation of Nature report on Canc&#250;n and the peatland programme could be a big win-win.<place-holder colnum=\"32057\"/></p><p>There may be difficulties in certain areas, but this is a work in progress, and we have to respect the fact that we are at a very early stage.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1: \"Report on Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Of course that is possibly easier to measure.

The committee is aware that this is an important issue for public-facing workers and that a solution is required.</p><p>Thanks, of course, are due to all those who provided us with oral evidence or submitted written evidence in aiding the committee's consideration of the bill's general principles. I pay particular thanks to Diane Barr for her help as the assistant clerk who drew together our report.</p><p>The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee is not used to dealing with what is probably a justice issue; the subject was rather different for us, but it has been enlightening to hear about the issues that affect many workers in their daily duties.</p><p>One of the key arguments that is made in favour of the bill is that it would act as a deterrent and thereby reduce the number of attacks on workers who provide a service to the public and their equipment. The majority view of the committee was that the bill is not the most appropriate method of seeking to ensure the protection of public-facing workers, because it does not extend the protection that is currently available under the common law.</p><p>The committee was unable to access data on the effectiveness of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005, which was introduced to tackle offences of the assault, hindrance and obstruction of persons who provide emergency services; therefore, we could not determine whether the legislation had acted as a deterrent. We had to question the effectiveness of the existing legislation if there were still so many assaults on public-facing workers. If the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service provided publicly the statistical data on the aggravating circumstances for common-law assault and breach of the peace prosecutions, it would be possible to draw meaningful conclusions on the effectiveness of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005 by accessing data from both before and after its introduction.</p><p>The committee is of the firm view that action needs to be taken now to address this serious problem and that the promotion of a strong public policy message that assaults on public-facing workers will not be tolerated is an essential part of helping to bring about the required culture change in our country. In evidence, the committee heard that, although existing common law takes account of aggravating circumstances, there remains a perception among workers that assaults are not taken seriously by the Crown Office and that that perception contributes to the thousands of incidents that go unreported each year. Witnesses told the committee that one way of tackling that perception and bringing about the necessary <place-holder colnum=\"31859\"/> culture change would be the introduction and application of prosecution and sentencing guidelines.</p><p>Similar guidelines have been introduced previously by the Lord Advocate to tackle knife crime, so that cases involving someone with a previous conviction for carrying a knife are prosecuted on indictment. That gives the court that deals with the matter a much stronger sentencing possibility.</p><p>Prosecution and sentencing guidelines should be introduced as soon as possible for assaults on public-facing workers, and their introduction should be accompanied by a high-profile publicity campaign. The committee's view is that such action will send out a strong message that violent and aggressive behaviour will not be tolerated. It will also demonstrate that the courts are taking assaults on public-facing workers seriously and will, we hope, help to tackle the on-going issue of underreporting.</p><p>There are two other measures that I will talk about briefly. The Chief Fire Officers Association Scotland and the Scottish Police Federation told the committee of the effectiveness of the preventive measures that they undertake, such as engaging with communities to target antisocial behaviour. Employers are taking relevant workplace measures such as introducing closed-circuit television and their own schemes to target unacceptable behaviour. They also have a greater awareness of the issues that staff face, encouraging them to report incidents and supporting them throughout the process.</p><p>The committee believes that the issues that the bill raises are significant and should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.

First, though, I should point out that, if the SNP Government had not been elected in 2007, there would have been no Calman commission or Scotland Bill. The debate is driven by the strength of support for the SNP&#8217;s determination to force the unionists to make more concessions. The committee needs to measure the strength of devolution in delivering some of our long-held beliefs and, in that respect, I want to dwell on two of the most important areas for the Highlands and Islands. Unfortunately, our experience of devolution is that it moves more slowly than glaciers melt. For example, we have never had proper control of fishing and other environmental aspects of the marine environment in which we in the north must try to earn our living. In the previous session of Parliament, we managed to get maps drawn that<place-holder colnum=\"31391\"/> showed the various boundaries. The Calman commission suggested that the situation be sorted out but, as the First Minister pointed out, the bill makes it clear that there will be no such sorting out and, indeed, that the Scottish Government&#8217;s overall responsibility in this respect will be reduced. </p><p>The Liberal Democrats have certainly to answer for the length of the debate on this. I am glad that Jeremy Purvis is speaking after me, so he will not need to intervene. Back in 1991, David Ross said in an article in <em>The Herald</em> on the Liberal councillor Dr Michael Foxley, who is now leader of Highland Council:</p><p>&#8220;The fish-farming industry and its domination by multi-national companies and its administration by the non-elected Crown Estate Commissioners is another of the doctor&#8217;s pet subjects.&#8221; Dr Foxley has had views on these things over many decades, and he has been joined by other elected representatives of the Liberal party. For example, after the Crown Estate review working group was set up, the northern isles MP, Alistair Carmichael, backed calls by the Orkney MSP, Jim Wallace, to change the role of the Crown Estate in Scotland. What happened to change that role from 1999 to 2006 under devolution and under Labour and the Liberals? Nothing.</p><p>In the SNP Government&#8217;s time, Tavish Scott has lodged a motion on the same subject, which was debated in the Parliament. On 27 April 2007, he said:</p><p>&#8220;The time has come for control of the seabed to be passed from London to the communities who depend on the coastal waters. I will be working with Isles MP, Alistair Carmichael, so that the UK Marine Bill can include measures to give Shetland back control of its seabed.&#8221; Did the UK bill that Labour introduced bring back that control? It ignored the possibility. Once again, there was delay, delay, delay. </p><p>And so it has gone on through to this year. The First Minister has pointed out what has happened. On 30 November, the Liberal Democrat MSP for Orkney, Liam McArthur, who is, unfortunately, not here, said:</p><p>&#8220;The Scotland Bill provides an opportunity to help coast communities and our aquaculture and marine renewable industries. The UK Government should review the Crown Estate&#8217;s role in Scotland and look at using the Bill to devolve powers and controls over the seabed.&#8221; The progress is even slower than glaciers melting. We are talking about a period from 1991 to nearly 2011. Those are the kinds of processes and burdens under which the Scottish people have to work. Thanks to the Liberal party and its continued ineffectiveness, even when it is in government in London and can convince its Tory allies to do something, we are faced with having to discuss this in the Parliament. Will we get the Liberals&#8217; <place-holder colnum=\"31392\"/> support in the committee that Wendy Alexander is convening? Will there be a new chapter? Will we get such powers, or will the Highland people once again be failed by the Liberal Democrats, who have failed them for decades? The bill will create a Scottish commissioner for the Crown Estate, who will be appointed by UK ministers; the Scottish ministers will merely be consulted. Wow. What progress.</p><p>If the committee is serious, it must make the changes in administration that the marine environment requires and changes in the responsibilities of the Government and the Parliament, which passed the leading climate change legislation in the world.

We are talking about the management of land. By and large, the land of Scotland is highly managed&#8212;very little of it is wild&#8212;but its ecological coherence can be addressed in that context. As we know, ecologies change. At present, the rewetting of peatlands, which is a particular interest of mine, is improving habitats for many of our species. It also allows us to tackle some climate change issues by sequestering carbon. There will be changes in the way in which land is used, in the way in which certain ecosystems are developed and so on. It is difficult to address the issue of ecological coherence here, given that it was raised only following the bill's introduction.</p><p>Robin Harper described geese as refugees. When people first began to live off Solan geese, or gannets, and other birds on islands such as St Kilda, I wonder whether they saw them as refugees, as likely to be food or&#8212;as someone has put it in more modern terms&#8212;as flying duvets. It might be suggested to people in North Uist, who are responsible for a lot of the correspondence on the problem that members in the Highlands and Islands receive, that there is an opportunity to make some new industries out of the excessive numbers of geese that are present. They find it difficult to get people to shoot the geese, but perhaps a new industry will come out of that.</p><p>I have a serious point to make about non-native species. We regularly have to pass secondary legislation on mink. That is an example of a long-running effort to remove a non-native species from our midst. It has always worried me that we do not get updates on record keeping about how well we are doing, except perhaps once a year, when the secondary legislation is considered. It is important that the bill should make more detailed provision in that area, if possible.</p><p>I note the moves to give beavers&#8212;a reintroduced species&#8212;protected status. I wonder what would have happened to the osprey, when it first came back in the 1950s, if we had treated it as a non-native species. We must be careful to recognise which animals and birds can live in our habitat and have been here before, and ensure that they are protected.</p><p>The issue of deer management, which is close to my heart, has been raised. I wish that deer management were practised to the full extent that it can be, but I believe that it is not. Although we recognise the great job that deer management groups do, I am concerned that the management of deer is tied up so much with the ownership and value of land, from which it should be somewhat detached.<place-holder colnum=\"31241\"/></p><p>We still have far too many deer. If there were an opportunity for them to live in a more natural habitat, which would include woodlands, they might grow larger; that would provide us with a much better stock of animals. We are hampered by the fact that the sale of estates is governed by the number of stags that can be shot. Careful consideration must be given to the issue of deer management. The Deer Commission for Scotland has just merged with SNH. We must see how that arrangement works out, but the voluntary principle must be kept under close scrutiny.</p><p>I turn to the issue of effective enforcement and the police response to wildlife crime. Other members have mentioned that illegal raptor persecution is still too widespread in various parts of Scotland. The recent incidents in my region this summer, at Skibo and Moy, illustrate the need for urgent efforts to be made to tackle such persecution, as raptors are a key part of our Highland natural heritage and are a major attraction for eco-tourists. It worries me that findings of eagle, sparrowhawk and buzzard carcases were reported in May this year. The owners of Skibo castle said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The owners and management of Skibo Castle are committed conservationists and do everything they can to support the welfare of wildlife and birds and will co-operate fully with the investigation.\"</p><p>I am not talking about guilt or innocence here, but it is very difficult for estates to manage such incidents. It depends on their outlook and their views on what the estate is for. It is important that, under the bill, we will at last make some link with what gamekeepers do&#8212;perhaps, they think, in the best interests of their employers. We ought to know that the employers are quite clear on that.</p><p>I welcome the letter from the Scottish Estates Business Group and the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association, which have \"repeatedly condemned such incidents\". They suggest that a better way forward is possible.</p><p>Vicarious liability measures are absolutely essential for the bill, and I hope that they, along with many other measures, will strengthen our support for wildlife in this country.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21121957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Although I am not a member of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, I am delighted to take part in the debate, because I have had previous involvement with the subjects to which the bill relates and wish to contribute some remarks that will, I hope, be helpful.

I will develop the point, and then I will let Jeremy Purvis in.</p><p>The debate is characterised by a lack of ambition in a proposal to shuffle the cards in the pack rather than to look at delivering a better overall picture at local and national levels. What bothers me is that that lack of ambition is tied up with the ability to tie the hands of the Scottish Government through the Calman toils that we are about to enter. We must recognise that, in a small economy, we need the freedoms that the people of Seattle and the people of Stavanger have. Jeremy Purvis is not prepared to give us those. The point that was made by James Hunter is most useful.</p><p>Let us look at structures for a moment. Jeremy Purvis gave the most interesting explanation that what we need in the Highlands is a bank. Yes&#8212;of course we need banks, but there are already banks. One of the questions is whether we are a statist country. Do things always have to be led by the public services or are we increasingly looking for the commercial sector to support such things, given the right financial structures? As John McFall pointed out, what we had was not a light touch but a soft touch under the British regulation of money. I am afraid that Ross Finnie and other people had better start to remember the <place-holder colnum=\"31136\"/> difference. We can be smart in how we organise such things.</p><p>We must consider how we should proceed. The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee has recognised that Scottish Development International has a job to do as part of the process of promoting exports. The chambers of commerce, the Scottish Council for Development and Industry and so on are also taking part in that work. It is not a case of just one body doing it, and it is not necessarily a question of saying that the bodies do not work. In the committee's report, we describe the Heineken model, whereby bodies provide services that are not already provided by others.</p><p>The committee is now considering the enterprise networks. Strengthening communities is one of the functions of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and a similar function is desperately needed in many parts of the Scottish Enterprise area. Increasingly, the evidence shows that not just firms but whole communities feel ignored. I hope that we will be able to address that. We can help by providing support, not just by providing loans through a bank. Such support is a state function that fills the gap and reduces the inequalities that have grown up over many years.</p><p>To talk about banks for a moment, where does the green investment bank fit into the picture that Jeremy Purvis painted? That is an interesting question. Thinking about our current crisis, the enterprise networks tell us that, in order to create jobs, we have to major in renewables in both the SE and the HIE areas. We are promised a green investment bank with our money being seeded into it in four years. Why cannot we have it now? In practical terms, why does not Jeremy Purvis address the fact that, if we could add to the &#163;400 million that is available to Scottish Enterprise and HIE this year the &#163;191 million in the fossil fuel levy, and use that money to support renewables investment, skills development and so on, we could see a transformation rather than a delay in taking the work forward? The argument that Jeremy Purvis is putting is a form of delay in dealing with the issues that we face, because we are discussing structures and not reality.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21121594", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry, but I will not at the moment.

However, it is worrying to see that the way in which the council has gone about doing that has called into question the ability of the council-run care homes to deal with key issues that the private sector is often unable to cope with. For example, the council-owned care homes have been well geared up to provide respite care.</p><p>One such care home, Duthac house, which is in Jamie Stone's home town, has a section that was built in the 1980s and which has been given very nearly top marks by the care commission. If it were run properly and properly maintained, Duthac house would be able to cope with the general run of older people during the next four or five years, which will be a period of austerity. However, the Lib Dem-Labour led council has wasted quite a lot of money on trying to modernise: it has spent &#163;2 million on plans for that, rather than on maintenance. The care commission has criticised some of the equipment, the kitchens and other areas of the care home. I wonder why that money could not have been spent on looking after the existing facilities in these rough, tough times.</p><p>I return to the question of disparity. The figures that Sandra White quoted, for which 2006 was the <place-holder colnum=\"30568\"/> final year, are not completely up to date, but show a clear trend. The disparity in the figures for 2004-05 shows that that was the point at which the local authority's expenditure increase was much greater than the expenditure increase&#8212;or, indeed, the costs&#8212;in the independent sector. In 2006, the average weekly cost of a place in a Highland Council care home was &#163;612, whereas the cost of a place in the independent sector was &#163;442&#8212;and we know that the disparity has since grown. We must ask ourselves what was going on at that time in the council-owned care homes that caused such an increase in costs. Were the extra costs due to the provision of pensions, better training and the higher quality of the staff in those care homes, compared with others? In private care homes not far from Tain, there are very poor standards that must be improved rapidly. Dingwall, in particular, has been in the news in our area. It bothers me that such examples seem to crop up again and again.</p><p>With the &#163;70 million in the pooled budgets for service redesign and a shift in the balance of care, we must try to bring into play the parts of the health service that enable people to lead more healthy lives, just as much as provision for older people. That is worth considering as part of the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21091606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Care Home Costs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "How can I follow that?

Under the Kyoto protocol being discussed at Canc&#250;n in December, there are proposals for peatland restoration to be included in national climate change accounting. The United Nations biodiversity convention summit in Japan is currently negotiating conservation targets for ecosystems.</p><p>At these major events, Scotland's peatlands are being promoted by the United Kingdom committee of the International Union for Conservation of Nature under its peatland programme. Some of the IUCN UK peatland programme members are in the public gallery. As our equivalent to rainforests, peatlands provide valuable services such as storing carbon, maintaining water quality and supporting wildlife, as well as a rich historical archive.</p><p>Of the world's 175 peatland nations, the United Kingdom is among the top 20 for carbon emissions from damaged peatlands. Scotland <place-holder colnum=\"30118\"/> supports over 80 per cent of the UK's deepest blanket bog peatlands. Rewetting damaged peatlands reduces the loss of climate change relevant emissions from the peat store and provides a long-term carbon sink.</p><p>Scotland is the world's stronghold for Atlantic blanket bogs and our lowland raised bogs are a European priority. From the flows of Caithness and Sutherland, right down to Galloway and the central belt, we have a wealth of peatland habitats. Scotland has several showcase peatland restoration projects, such as those at Forsinard, with conservation management involving wildlife charities such as RSPB Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage, as well as the Forestry Commission Scotland and the wind farm industry.</p><p>Peat soils cover just over a fifth of Scotland's land area and Scotland has more than two thirds of the UK's blanket and raised bog habitat, which is the deepest and most widespread of the peatland types. National assessments of the condition of the peatlands show that the resource is declining and that more than 20 per cent is so badly degraded that it is eroding. Damaged peatland affects the whole of society and should be recognised as an urgent issue that needs to be tackled.</p><p>Scotland's deepest peats store around 6,500 megatonnes of carbon, which is 10 times the amount of carbon stored in the whole of the UK's forest biomass. A loss of only 1 per cent of Scotland's peat would equal the annual greenhouse gas emissions of around 57 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. Conversely, restoring damaged peatland has great potential to help to reduce emissions and contribute to Scotland's climate change targets.</p><p>Peatlands also have a vital part to play in the delivery of clean water. Damaged peatlands cause sediments and so on, which cost a considerable amount to clean up when the water is used.</p><p>Scotland should be proud of its peatland heritage. We should ensure that land managers who help to maintain that vital part of our natural environment are supported in their efforts to secure a wide range of valuable environmental services.</p><p>The IUCN UK peatland programme, which was launched in Edinburgh in March, has begun an inquiry to examine the evidence for the benefits that peatlands have and to foster action for our peatlands. Its open inquiry event to facilitate public engagement was held yesterday at the University of Edinburgh. Evidence will be taken from expert witnesses, including peatland academics, the water industry and sporting and conservation organisations that have experience in peatland restoration.<place-holder colnum=\"30119\"/></p><p>There are things that the Parliament and the Government can do. There are key steps that the Scottish Government could consider. For example, a ministerial statement that recognised peatlands as an important ecosystem that delivers considerable benefits, and acknowledged that urgent action is required, would enhance the words of the draft land use strategy for Scotland. Such a statement would be a help, for a start.</p><p>The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change, Stewart Stevenson, has announced the Scottish Government's intention to include peatland restoration in its delivery of climate change targets. We are awaiting a decision from the next round of climate change talks, which will take place in Mexico in December, on whether new peatland rewetting rules will be adopted. A firm message of support for peatlands from the Scottish Government would provide a welcome stimulus to the discussion.</p><p>In view of the international Convention on Biological Diversity discussions, a renewed focus on delivering peatland restoration as part of a Scottish biodiversity strategy and a commitment to delivering all peatland-designated sites into favourable status is essential. The forthcoming report on policies and programmes should include a clear policy commitment to invest in restoring and conserving Scotland's peatlands.</p><p>The Scottish ministers have provided a ministerial direction for certain aspects to be considered in the context of climate change legislation, but they must direct the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, SNH and Forestry Commission Scotland to work co-operatively to deliver. The Scottish Government has a variety of peatland restoration policies and funding measures, such as the Scotland rural development programme, but access to funding must be made much easier, especially in these straitened times.</p><p>There is potential for Scottish Water to use its priority catchment fund to target the restoration of peatlands. It can learn from Yorkshire Water, which has had to deal with much more degraded bogs down south.</p><p>The Forestry Commission should be asked to review deep peat in state-owned forests and to identify areas for restoration. It must not be permitted to require replanting elsewhere, to compensate for the removal of trees and peatlands, because such an approach inhibits progress.</p><p>Planning authorities should be directed to enforce peatland restoration conditions that are associated with past peat extraction permissions, and to avoid giving further consents or extending existing consents for commercial peat extraction. <place-holder colnum=\"30120\"/></p><p>That would be asking quite a lot, but we should ask it.</p><p>Key to the issue is education. Work towards establishing a number of core, landscape-scale demonstration sites for peatland restoration throughout Scotland would offer the best means of enabling the academic community to back up the Government's actions. The Natural Environment Research Council and the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council should consider a hub approach that is based on the environmental research institute in Thurso, which is part of the North Highland College. Work could augment the already excellent work of the University of Edinburgh and others on measuring methane losses in the Forsinard peat bogs.</p><p>The focus of the debate is to secure the kind of action that I have talked about. We are discussing a complex subject that deserves much more public understanding. People need to understand the importance of peat in Scotland for our future. The benefits of safely developing and rewetting peat bogs represent a fantastic and historic opportunity that we should not miss.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21055760", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Peatlands"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have a soft spot for climate change intervention: it is a huge blanket bog of 400,000 hectares in Sutherland and Caithness, called the flows.

Evidence from the OECD countries shows that decentralisation of economic powers leads to increases in GDP, longer-term economic growth and greater revenues from Government to spend on services.</p><p>What are we being presented with by each of the parties that opposes the Scottish Government? We are being offered the Calman financial proposals. We do not know the detail of what will be offered by the Con-Dem Government, but let us think about it. Under Calman, Scotland would be given control of only 20 per cent of our revenues, so 80 per cent of the tax that was raised in Scotland would continue to go to the UK Government. As my colleagues have mentioned, key powers such as those relating to corporation tax and control of North Sea revenues, as well as key elements of environmental taxation, would remain reserved.</p><p>Under Calman, any unexpected drop in income tax revenues, such as the one experienced during the downturn, would leave Scotland facing a huge funding gap and inevitable cuts. As I have said, countries normally avoid that problem by using short-term borrowing to plug any unexpected gaps when receipts are low, which they pay back when receipts are high. The UK Government has that <place-holder colnum=\"30002\"/> power&#8212;indeed, as part of the bail-out of the banks, the Treasury is making a profit from it. However, under Calman, Scotland would have no short-term borrowing powers. Any increased revenues that were generated as a result of improvements in Scotland's economy would go to London, not to Scotland. That would create a disincentive to grow the economy. If that is the proposal that the Labour Party is making in its motion, there has to be another way. There could be something to be said for recycled wish lists, but they must contain something that is worth recycling. In this case, Labour's recycled wish list does not.</p><p>I turn to the SNP's conference and the attitude of the Opposition parties to our pledges to attempt, through the budget process, to freeze the council tax for another two years. We have heard that their attitude is that we must come up with the money to give local government a chance to develop. We want to try to keep free personal care as it is. Under the SNP, concessionary travel is safe and Scottish Water will remain in public ownership and will make more of its own energy, thereby reducing the cost to the taxpayer. The Barnett consequentials arising from the UK Government's protection of spending on the health service will be applied to the health service in Scotland and prescription charges will be abolished. It would have been interesting to hear some sort of response from the Opposition parties to all those proposals. Do they intend to protect things such as the health service and concessionary travel?

Yesterday the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment was in Mallaig promoting the sale of Scottish langoustines and prawns. Too few people in this country ever see a Scottish langoustine. I am perhaps luckier than most, but that is only because I know fishermen locally. The point is that they could get the same price for selling them to the market at home here if only they could establish a permanent supply chain. I hope that the Government is successful in securing that. The commitments and progress that have been made in the sector have been set out by members in the debate already. We should consider how well bedded in the industry is in various parts of Scotland.</p><p>In June I was taking some Canadian friends from Glasgow up to the north. The food in the restaurants in Glasgow and the produce that they saw on sale in the shops was light years different from what it might have been 10 years ago.</p><p>Overseas food exports come to &#163;800 million a year, whereas food imports from overseas are &#163;900 million a year. We must ask ourselves when we will be producing more of our own food. As John Scott said, food security is now more of an issue in the markets and in debate.</p><p>Other members have mentioned farmers markets, and I wish to highlight the fantastic success of the Perth farmers market. Studies that were carried out by Perth and Kinross Council and Scottish Enterprise Tayside in 2006 showed that, even then, the farmers market generated a direct annual income of &#163;311,000. That was &#163;31 for every &#163;1 of public support. Indeed, &#163;1 spent on the local food generated &#163;2.49 in the local economy, as opposed to &#163;1.40 when that &#163;1 was spent in a supermarket. People are not only getting value for money at farmers markets; they are getting the provenance, too. The farmers market movement has opened the door for so many people to see our terrific produce.</p><p>There are large numbers of small firms involved in the industry. One of them was highlighted yesterday, and I know it particularly well. Connage Highland Dairy near Inverness produces organic cheese&#8212;which we were able to sample in our canteen. It is now on sale in Harrods, although it is also available at very reasonable prices locally in our area and elsewhere. It is an ideal example to <place-holder colnum=\"28693\"/> highlight during what is also organic food fortnight, which is run by the Soil Association. The Soil Association's awards throughout the UK have thrown up a lot of interesting examples. I declare an interest as a member of the Soil Association and of the Scottish Crofting Federation. I will come back to that area in a minute. The beer and cider winner at the awards was the Black Isle Brewery's Yellowhammer, a beer that is produced very close to where I live. It won against competition from various contestants from throughout the UK.</p><p>I draw members' attention to an event that is coming up in Parliament on 10 November called crofting connections. Dozens of schoolchildren and many croft food producers are coming to Parliament to show us what crofting connections is doing. It involves 1,200 young people between the ages of five and 16 who live in remote rural communities throughout the Highlands and Islands. We will get a selection of the youngsters to come into Parliament, together with producers from the crofting areas, and they will show their wares. I hope that members will all get invitations and come along.</p><p>That reminds us that there were communal ways of working the land in the past. The communal ways of selling food now, through co-operatives, provides the modern way to conduct that kind of collective activity. Such events show schoolchildren both traditional and contemporary horticulture. It is not just about oats and kale&#8212;there is an array of vegetables, all sold by the likes of the Skye &amp; Lochalsh Food Link. It sells fruit, salads, oatcakes, shortbread, vegetables, herbs, meat, seafood, confectionery, preserves, cheese and ice cream. The group, which distributes a range of these products to hotels and shops in the area, sets an example for many such groups elsewhere.</p><p>Making, by the way, a Bute connection, I note that in Caithness and Sutherland, where we are trying to turn the economy around, the Duke of Rothesay has backed the Mey Selections brand, which has put the local food and drink industry back in the spotlight and is making a significant contribution to the area's economy. More than 400 food and drink producers contribute and, with one particular product now being sold through a large national supermarket, the brand is starting to get some recognition. By ensuring that many of the products are bought locally, are served in local hotels and so on, we improve not only the whole agricultural process, but food and other produce in our country.</p><p>I do not have much more time. Nevertheless, I want to warn Parliament about certain issues that are emerging as a result of people seeking simply to make a profit. First of all, we should not be importing diseased potato seed, problems with <place-holder colnum=\"28694\"/> which have increased since I asked questions about the matter in June. We should remember that cloning is now governed by European Union rules, and we need to be aware of animal welfare in our attempts to make farming sustainable. Above all, we need to address the issue of labelling to ensure that we protect the natural produce that Scotland can produce and is producing, and that people are aware of the differences between some of the lesser products available and the best of our own larder.</p><p>The debate provides an excellent chance to celebrate Scotland's food and drink, but we must take part ourselves by encouraging others to buy Scottish.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997464", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In this Scottish food and drink fortnight we are given a glimpse&#8212;many people need more than a glimpse&#8212;of what fantastic food we have in this country.

I will be interested to hear from the unionist parties&#8212;if we hear anything at all from them&#8212;about an aspect of why Scotland needs the powers of independence, which is so that it can raise its taxes and be able to control its finances from both sides.

Indeed, the Liberal Democrat leader gave support to the idea. It can be said that &#163;189 million is a small amount, but it could kick-start activity this year. We would like to see it this year to ensure the development of our offshore renewables and other investments. With that in mind, the idea is that community benefit can arise from renewables, for example through Forestry Commission developments. Indeed, I hope that such benefit will result from the Scottish Water bill and that we will tap into the current levies that the Crown Estate sends to Her Majesty's Treasury. Small sources of money will arise in that way, but we need to have the powers to borrow big time in order to be able to take forward our economy.</p><p>I turn to the excellent remark that was made about the Scottish Water bill going contrary to the idea of selling off our water to big business. Other European countries have nationalised industries that play a major part in the economy of the country; one example is the French electricity and gas industries. Scottish Water in public ownership is a success story. The Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee on which I sit is looking forward to considering why Scottish Water has done as well as it has. When we look at the plans to double the renewable energy capacity and the fact that Scottish Water uses so much electricity&#8212;it is the biggest commercial user of electricity in the country&#8212;we can recognise that it is far-sighted of the Government to propose that we have the opportunity to make the best of those natural resources.

Given that we are talking about including the targets for peat conservation in our climate change targets, we must ensure that that argument is brought to bear when we discuss the cutting of large tracks into the hills and beyond.</p><p>The planning permissions that Peter Peacock mentioned need to be reviewed. I hope that the minister will help us in that regard. It seems surprising that that aspect was not addressed when the national parks legislation was being put together. I hope that that can be done. I am just sorry that members who have an interest in that aspect did not seek to address it when the orders <place-holder colnum=\"27129\"/> were going through Parliament to extend the Cairngorms national park, which most members welcomed. Perhaps the national parks can be included in planning permissions in some way through secondary legislation.</p><p>If we are to value land, we must come together on a land use strategy&#8212;most members agree on that. We must recognise that some people's view of what is wild land is not acceptable to those of us who live in the countryside. Although many people use wild land for recreation, we should not confuse wild land with land that has not been affected by the hand of humans&#8212;and most land in Scotland has been affected by human hands, however far away it is from a road. On that point, I depart from the John Muir Trust's view of wild land, and I recognise that we need a balanced land use policy that takes into account all legitimate needs.</p><p>I hope that the debate maintains that balance, because if we are to value land, we should allow for some means by which the people who use it can contribute. Given the demise of shooting rates under the Tory Government in 1996, perhaps some type of valuation of land for users of that sort could be reintroduced to help with the planning process and to help us to ensure that there is balanced land use in the future.</p><p>Thank you, Presiding Officer, for the opportunity to take part in this debate, and if I may I will excuse myself before it ends.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20826453", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hill Tracks (Scottish Uplands)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Peter Peacock on bringing the debate to the chamber.

I welcome my being able to visit, during the climate change conference in Copenhagen, cycling organisations and the organisation that promotes cycling in that city. Copenhagen has a lead of nearly 70 years on us. For a long time, people have made decisions in Denmark and the Netherlands about improving <place-holder colnum=\"27106\"/> cycleways and making it easier for people to use cycles; indeed, they have made the use of bicycles possible to the extent that around a third of people in the city of Copenhagen travel to work or school by bicycle. If we could have the amount of investment that has been made there over the years, that would make up for those 70 years and would be an admirable target for us to aim at.</p><p>It is always interesting to hear people demanding that more money be spent, especially members of parties who not long ago talked about having vast cuts in total budgets. We are likely to see such cuts, so there is the question of rebalancing budgets. What would money be taken away from? Patrick Harvie might say in response to that question that we should stop building a motorway and spend the money that would be saved in a way that would allow us to see a better bang for our buck. That is a possibility, but there are many things that we can do to move forward in these difficult times, and I will concentrate on two or three of them.</p><p>It is clear that national co-ordination of cycle training is most likely to get things started again. I will use my village of Evanton as an example. As members have said, schools used to do cycle training, but headteachers and parents preferred that to start in the upper primary. In Copenhagen, we found that, because many families cycle for fun, cycle training had to be provided only for the children of immigrants who had no experience of cycling. That suggests to me that cycle training must start at a much earlier age so that, by the time children are in mid-primary, they are confident enough to be able to cycle to and from school in a reasonably safe environment.</p><p>At the beginning of this decade, there was the safer routes to school programme. In my village, there were discussions about how we might facilitate walking and cycling. However, an issue was raised in the committee that I will bore my fellow committee members with again: how can cyclists who are doing a right turn be prioritised over on-coming vehicular traffic? Councils and Transport Scotland must find some way of reducing speeds or putting in the means by which cyclists can get a chance to cross lines of traffic. In our case, that is needed so that parents are confident that their children can cycle to school.</p><p>Although walking and cycling issues are not unknown, when I go on my bicycle at the weekends for newspapers and the messages from our local store, I do not see many cyclists. There was an old gentleman&#8212;sadly, he passed on two or three years ago&#8212;who cycled all the time, but I do not see as many youngsters or their parents cycling regularly. A hilly environment&#8212;part of our village is on a hill&#8212;is a disincentive to cycling, but <place-holder colnum=\"27107\"/> somehow or other, we must get through to people the health benefits of cycling.</p><p>I will make a suggestion that members may agree with. Just as we have had transition towns for environmental purposes and fair trade towns, we could have active travel or walking and cycling villages and towns as a means to get people to discuss in their local communities how they might go about making the advances that can be made without a massive amount of physical investment being required. I hope that that idea is taken seriously. If it has legs&#8212;or wheels&#8212;it is possible that the organisations that are always after us for more investment might be able in a practical way to engage people in parts of the country other than the big cities in the process of becoming part of the active travel movement. There might be considerable interest in doing that in Scotland.</p><p>I will talk a little bit about people being able to get their bicycle to where they want it to be. In some cases, that involves taking it on a train and using it at the other end. In my part of the Highlands, people want to commute into the large centre of Inverness, and it would be wonderful if they could do that by train. The committee heard evidence from the Highlands and Islands strategic transport partnership's railway development officer. When he was asked about the need for more bike space on trains, I was appalled to hear him say that that was not physically possible and that we just need more trains. In our area, single-track provision and a lack of passing places means that the railway would be completely unable to accommodate more trains. If someone books a bike space to travel the length of the far north rail line&#8212;a very long journey of four hours over 120 or 130 miles&#8212;there is less space for others to do that over the piece. In the next round of the ScotRail franchise negotiations, we should try to ensure that more bicycles can be carried on the rail network. If we are not to get new rolling stock, one of the simplest possible things would be for carriages to be redesigned so that they can take double the number of bicycles that can be carried at present.</p><p>Having made those few points, I pass on to another member who might have other fresh ideas.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20826408", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Active Travel"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As an active member of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee who took part in much of the inquiry, I, too, thank those who made the inquiry possible.

In a country that has more than 300 years' experience of creating some of the most sound and long-term financial organisations in the world in asset management, insurance, asset servicing and so on, the way in which we promote a future for financial services is perhaps one of the most central issues not just of this time but of all generations.</p><p>To counter that, we should probably consider Gavin Brown's stricture that we must direct our thoughts to things that we can deal with here in Scotland, directly or indirectly. However, if we narrow down the issue and consider what we can do now, we find huge constraints on us, because we do not have powers to regulate financial markets. There are issues with how we would consider that in future. The committee was bombarded with arguments about how financial institutions, particularly banks, ought to be organised. Part of the problem is that, because of the uncertainties of another year of discussing that, as Ross Finnie described, we will be left considering whether to take the Glass-Steagall route or the slightly different route that Adair Turner has suggested.</p><p>Adair Turner suggests that, unfortunately, and whether we like it or not, it is difficult to separate investment banking from retail banking. It has been argued that investment banking funnels cash into the commercial side, which then provides for economic recovery. If that is so, living wills must be considered for too-large-to-fail organisations. Institutions that go for riskier operations and deals must be required to carry a greater amount of capital.</p><p>From that point of view, the issue is complex. Breaking up the banks could do considerable damage to institutions in Scotland. When people talk down Scotland and imply that the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS should be smaller, they are not addressing the potential of financial services organisations that are in a global market but based here.

The Scrabster to Stromness route is much longer and much more exposed.</p><p>The qualities of the new catamaran MV Pentalina on the route under debate are well tested. By contrast, the design of the Hamnavoe is much less cost effective, although a design other than the catamaran would probably be needed to serve the open ocean route. The ferry design that was commissioned at the same time as the large NorthLink ferries could easily carry more cars and indeed, such ferries do so safely on the routes to Orkney and Shetland.</p><p>As we have heard, despite disdain from civil servants and Orkney Islands Council, Andrew Banks persisted. Thanks to the Gills Bay harbour committee and after a major setback with the linkspan, Andrew Banks was able to get a sheltered berth for his roll-on, roll-off ferry. Orkney Islands Council did not help in respect of the Burray harbour proposal that would, at least in summer, have cut the journey time by half an hour. Cuts in journey times are needed. The more time someone spends on a ferry, the more expensive it is; road and other modes of transport are cheaper than ferry transport. The proposed short sea route was not helped by the decisions of Orkney Islands Council; the journey time is longer than it needs to be.<place-holder colnum=\"26609\"/></p><p>The Scottish Government recognised the reliability of the Pentalina when the volcanic ash emergency began. With hindsight, people can now see that some of the steps that were taken at the time were over the top. However, at the time, we did not know the effect of the volcanic ash. The Scottish Government's decision to send the Hamnavoe to Bergen was an important part of bringing people home. Locals from Caithness who were stranded in Norway included the UHI Millennium Institute lecturer Linda Rams&#248;y, who was delighted to have been given the chance to get home and back to work, as were many other people.</p><p>Unnecessary alarm was whipped up in Orkney by people who should have known better. Figures for the past four years show more than 250 weather-related cancellations to NorthLink ferry services to the islands and 620 weather-delayed sailings. People who use those services to attend mainland appointments may have been inconvenienced by the three-day disruption that ensued as a result of the Bergen rescue, but there are many more days in each year on which the NorthLink service has not delivered because of the weather. As for bypassing the Aberdeen-Kirkwall-Lerwick service, NorthLink has abandoned 41 calls since 1 July 2006. People correctly said that hospital appointments were affected during the short time when the Hamnavoe was not available, but there have been many more occasions when that also happens because of bad weather. Flights are also disrupted at those times.</p><p>A clearer definition of \"lifeline services\" is needed. When we see headlines such as that in <em>The Orcadian</em> of 22 April, \"Pentland Ferries left to cover as planes grounded and Orkney's lifeline ferry service removed\", we have to ask: what is a lifeline? A lifeline is a regular ferry that takes the plane's place to do the job of transporting people from the islands to the mainland.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20811012", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pentland Ferries"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Mary Scanlon on securing the debate.

Misuse is (to paraphrase) a wilful failure to cultivate the land or put it to any other purposeful use agreed to by the landlord or the Commission.\"</p><p>The committee is talking about dialogue with</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the landlord or the Commission\"</p><p>and the crofting community. If we are to make progress, we must acknowledge that the debate between the regulatory bodies, grazings committees and crofters has not been adequate. If it had been adequate, the neglect that is represented by the figures that I read out could not have built up over the years. We must find a means of identifying neglect that does not just depend on someone complaining about the neglect, as happened in the past. We must find triggers that allow the commission and others to deal with the matter. My view is that grazings <place-holder colnum=\"26158\"/> committees should draw up reports&#8212;which could be of a simple nature&#8212;annually.</p><p>The committee considered a detailed report from Camuscross, in Skye, which contained photographs and identified decisions that had been detrimental or helpful to crofting. The evidence was complex, but it would be possible for local people to produce a photographic record of what they regard as problems or beneficial developments. Such an approach could help the commission in its regulatory duties and, through the elected element on the commission, focus on means of getting to the root of the problems I want to lodge an amendment at stage 2 that would allow such dialogue to take place. If we consider how we got to where we are, we find that ensuring that the Crofters Commission is doing something useful under the existing laws has been a strikingly low priority for Governments. People have said that if the commission had carried through the work that it had been given to do we would not need to take further steps. The commission has not done that, and part of the reason for that is that its work has not been given high priority at political level. In the context of crofting's future, not telling the commission to get its work done was a shocking dereliction of duty.</p><p>The supplementary evidence from the commission shows that it will require much more money if it is to be able to process the cases that we are talking about. It is therefore incumbent on members of all parties to ensure that the bill provides an opportunity to deal with many issues that have been shamefully neglected by all Governments.</p><p>Croft mapping is a key part of ensuring that we regulate properly. During the arguments about land reform during and after the 1990s, the idea of a map-based register of the land of Scotland was central to ensuring that we understood who owns the land and could discuss how it could be used. Shucksmith said that we need a map-based register of crofts. The approach must be legally valid and must be able to deal not just with registration when people change the use of crofts but with decisions about where boundaries are.</p><p>Labour Party members suggested today that we should not turn over stones that should not be turned over. That is not the way to take crofting forward. Oversight by Government is bringing to the issue the potential for regulation that could allow us to move into a new era in crofting, by rooting out neglect. The fundamental issue of land use is at the root of crofting, and crofting communities cannot be supported unless the land is properly used.</p><p>If Scottish taxpayers are to support the regulation of crofting, surely they have a right to <place-holder colnum=\"26159\"/> demand that the land be better used. There are far too many examples of the land not being used properly, which is why we must ensure that as it continues its work on the bill the committee acknowledges that issues have been neglected at Government level. Crofting will benefit enormously if we take the regulatory steps that are set out in the proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766264", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer members to my registered interest as a member of the Scottish Crofting Federation, in which there are more varied views even than in the Liberal-Conservative coalition Government.

On Sunday, when the Russians celebrated the 65th anniversary of the great patriotic war, it was interesting to see a body of Welsh Guards parading in Red Square in Moscow, along with French, United States and Russian troops. One of the leaders of the convoys is still alive and was a guest of the Russian Government at the ceremony.</p><p>I have been involved in helping to ensure that there are memorials to the convoys at Loch Ewe and at Lyness, in Orkney. Merchant ships gathered at Loch Ewe before they sailed off, with a naval escort, which gathered around Orkney. On Sunday I laid flowers on the memorial for the Russian Arctic Convoy Club at Rudha an t-Sasain on the south side of Loch Ewe. Beside the fine monument there are little stones, on which individuals who took part have laid their names, reminding us that there are still people alive who took part in the incredible convoys.</p><p>To celebrate the 65th anniversary of VE day, Sergey Krutikov, consul general of the Russian Federation in Edinburgh, honoured 30 survivors of the Arctic convoys with medals. The stories that those people have to tell are amazing. Every schoolchild should hear some of those stories&#8212;they would be eye-openers for them. The survivors are scattered across the country and I know two or three of the old guys. Sandy Manson, from John o'Groats, got his 65th anniversary medal. Reay Clarke, from Edderton, was not well enough to attend, so his medal was posted to him. It seems to me that as part of the celebration we can do more to pass on people's memories to younger people.</p><p>At the ceremony in the Merchants' hall, Fergus Wood, the provost of Stirling Council, made a speech. He is the veterans champion for the Stirling Council area. I would like to hear more about veterans champions taking up the cause of veterans of the current age and being given every <place-holder colnum=\"26118\"/> support to do so. Champions are the local link for the processes that are set in train, in particular by the Scottish Government.</p><p>Like the Russians, we in Scotland respect our veterans and remember the people who set out on the convoys, some of whom were never to return. In that regard we have a fitting link with Russia, which is becoming an important partner in trade, education and cultural exchanges. I encourage the people who come to Scotland to visit the places from which the convoys left&#8212;it is tourists rather than service personnel who come now, of course. When I was a member of Ross and Cromarty District Council, the council set up a naval trail that enables people to visit those places. Since then, the convoy memorial at Loch Ewe has been built. I hope that Highland Council does more to ensure that it is properly signposted and that people know about it.</p><p>The Russian consul general laid flowers at the memorial in Orkney, which was unveiled at Lyness in August. For the first time, there is a memorial there to acknowledge the convoys that were so vital to success in the war.

WWF makes the important point that we must take into account the pay-as-you-throw approach to some kinds of <place-holder colnum=\"26078\"/> waste. People in cities have problems with waste collection. The outside bins in Edinburgh that we pass on our way to the Parliament are an example of that. If we had bins that sorted the waste, that would be much more helpful. My local council&#8212;Highland Council&#8212;has different collection processes in different parts of its area, but we nevertheless have separation at source. People will not buy into the aim until we can help with that.</p><p>We talk about the costs of such activities. Education costs will be involved and how the pay-as-you-throw approach is used must be examined carefully. A young family in which busy parents are bringing up children might have great problems in finding the time to deal with waste. We must find ways to help such people. The reason why schemes have succeeded in places such as Germany has been sorting at source.</p><p>Commercial waste is a much bigger subject. We are having an extension added to our house. The architects and builders are fairly eco-friendly, but a huge amount of unsorted waste has nevertheless been generated. It is unfortunate that that, too, adds to the problems of raising our targets. Having commercial people sort out the waste before they take it to landfill&#8212;or before it is recycled, as we move on to that&#8212;will be a central part of making progress. Having talked to many of the builders who have worked on our little project, I believe that commercial sites contain many skips that are full of indiscriminate waste. If all that were sorted, much of it could be used, which would help us enormously.</p><p>If we are to succeed, we must of course minimise waste in the first place. I am sure that we will have plenty of wood for our house's wood-fired stoves for many years to come from the excess of what was used to build the extension room that I mentioned.

The Labour Party made sure that, in the arrangements for the Scottish Parliament, we had 73 constituency members and 56 top-up members, which is less proportional. It did not want full proportionality, which is where Labour members' arguments about the first-past-the-post system fall down.

Will Hutton, writing about the subject last Sunday in <em>The Observer</em>, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Above all, if fairness is a value that we care about, the voting system is an offence to any conception of fair political representation. A state that can collude in this degree of unfairness in its electoral system is unlikely to be especially fair itself.\"</p><p>Having the debate about allowing people to be elected by a fairer system will change that state fundamentally.

The SNP has long taken the principled position that votes must be fair and represent the views of the people, and we have championed proportional voting systems for decades. The only way of ensuring that the public's opinion is put into practice is to have the fairest system. Today's debate about STV in multimember seats addresses such questions for the first time.</p><p>As a Highlands and Islands member, I remember the Kilbrandon commission, which discussed PR for Scotland but found that there was some problem with very large seats with scattered populations.

I submit my remarks in that context. I will rehearse some of the arguments that Highlands and Islands Enterprise made in adopting that position.</p><p>As members agree, the potential impact of transmission charges is discrimination against renewable energy sources in peripheral regions, such as islands or areas of low population density. However, there is also distortion of the cross-border trade. It is hard to separate the issues of discriminatory access and charging.

Pumped storage gets a double whammy in that respect. The locational charges to which Mr Macdonald referred and which I am discussing are very inflexible. Renewables must be where the resource is and nuclear power must be where the consentable sites are. There is an issue about where those developments can be set up and what charges will be made. Coal and gas plants have to be where the carbon transport and storage infrastructure is. However the modern system is configured, it should recognise that location is a factor, but we must consider whether there needs to be a charge for that.</p><p>There is an impact on consumers. Do consumers in low transmission charge areas benefit from lower wholesale electricity prices? It is a complex picture. Although we think that the BETTA system is getting BETTA and BETTA for consumers in the far north of Scotland, I suggest that if there were local electricity grids, they would not be part of that system. In the future, because we are going to turn grids round, instead of <place-holder colnum=\"25494\"/> generating electricity in a central place and stretching it out into thin copper wires at the far end, we will see the opposite. There is, therefore, still room for people to set up new forms of grid. I suggest that the question of lower wholesale prices and so on is germane. Do customers of generators that pay lower transmission charges benefit from lower wholesale electricity prices? If all charges are passed on to consumers, why differentiate?</p><p>The issue of cross-border trading&#8212;not just between Scotland and England&#8212;is interesting. Take the example that Dr Keith MacLean has used of trading between France, the UK and Ireland, which is a European arrangement. The generator pays once, in the home state. The differences in the cost are dealt with through intertransmission system operator compensation&#8212;the ITC mechanism. The costs of ITC are added to the domestic transmission charges. In Great Britain, the transmission charges are locational, but in France there is a flat rate, which is based on usage. One can get electricity from anywhere in France and export it and it will be the same price. In Ireland, they have a flat rate, which is based on capacity.</p><p>Here are the anomalies. If one trades from the UK to Ireland, the north of Scotland generator has to pay &#163;22 per kilowatt, but the south-east of England generator is paid &#163;7 per kilowatt. On supply to England, the north of Scotland generator pays &#163;22 per kilowatt and the Irish generator pays &#163;6 per kilowatt. Supplying from anywhere in France is cheaper than from anywhere in Scotland. Is the BETTA system actually working for us? I wonder.</p><p>I turn to the renewables directive, which makes it illegal for electricity transmission costs in member states to discriminate against electricity from renewable energy sources including, in particular, electricity that is produced in peripheral regions, such as the north of Scotland. Logically, one would suggest that the EU law is unanswerable, but Britain might argue that the charging regime is cost reflective. People are suggesting that somehow or other we in the north of Scotland are benefiting more than we are paying in. In fact, the discrimination is in a European context. I ask those who might form the next Government in London whether they will work with the directive or against it. If Scotland works with the European directive, it will give Scottish producers and consumers a far better deal. In accepting that, I will be interested to hear the Labour and Tory spokespeople sum up&#8212;assuming, of course, that Mr Clegg is not going to be Prime Minister.</p><p>The Highlands and Islands and the rest of Scotland have to have confidence. We have to <place-holder colnum=\"25495\"/> ensure that we take a logical and sensible approach. If we can avoid the possible obstacles, the opportunity exists for Scotland to be part of the European grid that we talked about.

One of the board's development officers said, \"Of course it is.\" The problem that we have is that out there, appreciation of the language has to develop along with the effort to teach more people to become Gaelic speakers. Out there in the community, there are a lot of misconceptions about what is going on.<place-holder colnum=\"25416\"/></p><p>A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure&#8212;and, at times, the pain&#8212;of taking part in a debate in Caithness on the place of Gaelic in that county. It was a civilised affair that had been billed as if it was going to be a shooting gallery with those of us on the panel as the targets.</p><p>Although, fortunately, the non-Gaels were polite, they sent some barbs in the direction of Gaelic. One panellist said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It's a minority movement, with the backing of the Gaelic Act&#8212;they are ramming it down our throats.\"</p><p>I do not think that that is the case. The trouble is that people do not even have the self-esteem to understand that their own Caithness dialect is a dialect of Scots, and that it will benefit from debate about the other language: Gaelic. We must encourage people to recognise who they are and to understand that the diversity of languages in this country is something to celebrate and which gives people a good feeling.</p><p>The Royal National Mod in Caithness later this year will not only encompass Gaelic but recognise the Norse heritage in the Caithness dialect of Scots. As members have mentioned, the census is coming next year; we have been dealing with it in the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, and the language questions are in there once again.</p><p>The language question on Gaelic has been in the census for 100 years. I am delighted that it has been included again, and we hope that this time round, we will get a realistic picture of the number of Gaelic speakers, in the hope that it is going up. For the first time, in an attempt to bolster that information, the census will include a question on the number of people who speak Scots. As the convener of the cross-party group on Scots, I view the two languages together, supporting the recognition that Scotland is a diverse place and that Gaelic and Scots have big parts to play in the self-esteem of our country as we move forward.</p><p>I hope that if today's debate does nothing else, it will send a message to people who, in a very curmudgeonly way, say, \"Why are we going to waste money on these past languages?\" Some do say such things; I will not go into detail, but such reactionary attitudes against Gaelic and Scots can fill newspaper pages. We must have a good argument that explains why it is far better for people to be open-minded and welcoming.</p><p>It was interesting to hear the arguments that were made at the Sutherland summit for why Sutherland is an attractive place for people to visit. Dave Thompson mentioned the scenery and the wildlife, and other people recognise that. German visitors had the opportunity to see the Gaelic language on road and street signs, and to hear it spoken, and that was one of the attractions for <place-holder colnum=\"25417\"/> them. That diversity, and the ability of people to recognise it&#8212;as those from Germany did&#8212;could be much more widespread.</p><p>The Gaelic plan allows for the possibility that a lot more people will come to the country because they choose to see a living culture, not just the remnants of a dead one that one can find in the piles of fuar l&#224;raichean: the piles of stones that used to be houses in the villages that were cleared so long ago.</p><p>I am delighted to support the action plan, but I am concerned that we make the argument for the money that is required to extend the schools. I am keen that the councils in areas in which Gaelic is widely spoken do not in any way stop recruiting Gaelic teachers at present or water down the conditions under which they are recruited. I am concerned that those things might happen because of the cuts, and I make a plea to council leaders to ensure that in these straitened times, Gaelic is not unnecessarily a victim of cuts.</p><p>The Gaelic plan has a lot to do. This is a time of financial belt tightening, but also a time of hope for this country. I believe that that hope is encapsulated in plans such as the one that we are discussing today and in the belief that our variety of languages gives many of our citizens a life with a good deal more depth and enjoyment. We are arguing about Gaelic as one of the family of languages in Scotland. A language is a means to say so much more, and that is what we are here to underpin today.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763495", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic (Action Plan)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tha mi a' cur f\u00e0ilte air \"Ginealach \u00d9r na G\u00e0idhlig\".

My contention at the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee has been that market forces have failed. It is not a question of being able to have competition between two different petrol stations on islands, because the same supplier takes the fuel to the islands. Competition does not work, so we have to intervene by some means to ensure that market forces are dealt with.</p><p>I have suggested that we consider bulk buying by local councils in such areas. I proposed that for the Highland Council area, but John Laing, the councillor in charge of the council's transport, environmental and community services committee, said that it would be too complicated. Well, I am sorry. It is an idea that people on islands want to be implemented. As the cabinet secretary is looking for ideas, I hope that that might be considered because, in certain areas, we must ensure that local petrol stations are supplied at competitive prices. If there has been a disadvantage of 10p in terms of fuel duty, that has not helped either, but intervening on the market is an important part of the solution.</p><p>The Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee threw out&#8212;or closed, we should say&#8212;a petition from the Western Isles because the Labour members and the Green convener considered that the wording of it was such that it could be closed because the cabinet secretary and the Government had been asked for their responses.

Perhaps we need to ask parents about their responsibilities: are they moving out of their comfort zone, or is it a case of getting their children to university and into the safe professions? One of the reasons why Ireland has not been as successful a society as it should have been is that the middle classes have aimed for comfort, rather than for the adventure of taking the economy forward. The governance of our schools should expose children to such ideas. It bothers me that when the Conservatives talk about diversity in Scotland, what they are actually talking about is uniformity, and the ideology driven by the Conservatives in London. Derek Brownlee recently gave examples of schools set up under Labour and the Tories, based on ideology. We do not need to talk about setting up schools. Where are we going to put a free school in Easter Ross, among the community schools that are already there? That is a load of piffle. We need schools that meet the needs of each area.

In Scotland, parents and teachers work together. In fact, the reason why Thatcher failed to break Scottish teachers in the 1980s is because the parents were right behind them.

We will somehow have to take account of the rural aspects of that report in the support payments that come out at the end of the debates.

We must reduce our reliance on imported animal feed and instead substitute local alternatives. I would like to see farmers showing more enthusiasm for crop rotation, projects such as the green pig project&#8212;although that is outside the current support systems&#8212;and nitrogen fixing crops. We must consider what effect imported food is having, such as soya on the pampas of Argentina and so on. It cannot go on. Consideration of how our farmers provide the feed for our animals must be part of the solution, as well.</p><p>The greenhouse gas mitigation issues for farmers and crofters, which are also mentioned in the UK Climate Change Committee's report, can be taken forward through, for example, a moderated form of the Maitland Mackie proposals. Far more farmers could be producing their own renewable energy and could gain more income from that. We should consider their ability to do that in relation to the point about subsidies. <place-holder colnum=\"24089\"/></p><p>Maitland Mackie argued that producing renewable energy could provide more income than the subsidies would. I am not suggesting that it is an easy change to get from the current position to there, but we will start feed-in tariffs for renewable energy production from domestic and community sources on 1 April, and in the interest of supporting the delivery of answers through Brian Pack's inquiry, I suggest that we have to get farmers doing such things, which fit the climate change agenda.</p><p>On environmental goods with regard to woodlands and how less favoured area support scheme payments are made, it is essential to ensure that people get a fair return. Graded land use can work to some extent in that respect, but we also need to pay special attention to island needs.</p><p>I turn to the tenant farming sector, which has been mentioned several times. We cannot have a system in which land is taken out of agriculture by landowners. If a third of our farms are still in tenancies and people who are trying to get started want tenancies, we have to find ways to allow that, otherwise we will have to revisit the land reform legislation and reconsider the issues. As crofters have a right to buy, it might be necessary&#8212;unless something is sorted out quickly in the next session of Parliament, or even sooner&#8212;to give tenant farmers more rights so that they can produce with some certainty in the future.</p><p>The other issue that might inhibit success is the current attitude of the banks. The fact that they are lending on swingeing terms is a huge inhibitor to investment in farming. Indeed, it takes the definition of usury to new heights. Banks are demanding pounds of human flesh&#8212;not pounds of sheep flesh or beef&#8212;from farmers for their money. Unless we are able to take a cross-cutting approach to supporting farmers in the ways that I have suggested, Brian Pack will not succeed. We wish him every success and look forward to dealing with the details of his report, but the fact is that these areas cannot be ignored.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20649017", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Justice and Law Officers: \"Inquiry into Future Support for Agriculture in Scotland\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to take part in the debate.

It is interesting to have to focus on a language, as such, because language is a medium for expressing all the things that we do in life. At a recent meeting of the cross-party group on co-operatives, co-operative members talked about what their main focus was and said that the bottom line was that their businesses were made a success because they were co-operatives. The fact is that, for Gaels and others throughout this country, life is made more of a success by having the medium of Gaelic through which to view all the things that we do every day.</p><p>The high approval ratings for BBC Alba so far in the areas of news, current affairs, community information, music, lifestyle and entertainment show that people are looking at the normal things in life through the medium of another of this country's great languages. It is essential that the normalisation of Gaelic, which has been mentioned by a number of people today and was discussed by Arthur Cormack in his submission for the debate, is seen as the way forward. In communities in which there is resistance to such normalisation, we need to argue for a live-and-let-live approach. We also have to point out that the model of a local television system that we now have, which breaks the mould of the system whereby programmes are delivered to our television screens by a large, centralised body from afar, provides an excellent model for other kinds of local television that should develop in our country so that we have a multitude of choices. That choice is obviously there nowadays on platforms such as Freeview, which I have <place-holder colnum=\"23772\"/> benefited from in my home in Easter Ross. I have had free satellite television in Edinburgh, but I think that that is only because I inherited a dish&#8212;there is no way that I would be buying one from Mr Murdoch.</p><p>The fact is that programming has to be made available to people on their own terms. They have a right to that access.</p><p>It is interesting to see the reach that BBC Alba already has. At the Sutherland summit that took place last August, there was a discussion about the role of Gaelic in that area. One of the points that was made was that German tourists who had seen BBC Alba were interested in coming to Sutherland and the Highlands to see what the places where Gaelic is spoken were like. That is an exact example of how the reach of BBC Alba helps our attempts for Scotland to be recognised further afield. There is evidence of continental interest in the Gaelic language, and I hope that the people of Sutherland will take that interest in that spirit.</p><p>The summit identified the geopark in the north-west as one of the principal features that make Sutherland unique. Alongside the geopark and the range of internationally important natural heritage features were Gaelic culture and place names, local food and crofting, all of which could be better developed to sustain the economy.</p><p>BBC Alba can play a part in helping to sustain the economy of fragile areas and can expose viewers a wider range of entertainment than the big centralised channels carry. Who could have seen some of the lower divisions of football, rugby and other sports if BBC Alba had not gone for that gap in the market? Well done.

I will deal with some of the problems in my speech, and I hope that the minister will reflect on them.</p><p>First, I am happy to welcome the upgrades to eight further exchanges. The areas that have been identified have an improving situation at the moment. Apparently, the Highlands and Islands, which I represent, has on average 95 per cent ADSL coverage, which is a higher average than Britain or Scotland as a whole. However, the level of that access is so low that Cathy Jamieson's remarks are pertinent about the time that it would take to download a programme. The BBC iPlayer is the common standard. If someone cannot watch a programme on it instantly, they do not have a <place-holder colnum=\"23435\"/> broadband system that is worthy of the name. Also, the limited capacity in exchange activate areas might be limiting broadband take-up.</p><p>When last year I carried out a major consultation exercise in the more remote parts of the Highlands and Islands and Orkney, I had a very large response rate&#8212;about 30 per cent of households&#8212;from the IV27 postcode, which is north-west Sutherland. I was amazed by people's concern that the current system could work at the level that Cathy Jamieson highlighted.</p><p>A number of the proposed remedies just will not work. Is it physically possible to meet the universal service commitment of 2Mbps to every household within the allocated time and, if so, how much will it cost? Indeed, the problems of cost have been highlighted by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and in the Analysys Mason report, which suggests that the 50p levy on phone lines should be able to deliver to in excess of 90 per cent of the UK and 85 per cent of the Highlands and Islands. However, no timescale has been specified in that respect. About 95 per cent of the Highlands is already connected, but the challenge is to connect all the remotest areas, which at the moment do not have the service, and provide a level playing field for them and the people whose service is not at the same megabyte level. That proposal is still in the air.</p><p>As for the 50p levy on phone lines, what about mobile broadband? Why can we not have a more progressive form of getting the funding? We should be able to introduce that but, of course, we are unable to raise taxes. London is proposing the measure in the Finance Bill, but it is questionable whether the current Government will be in power after May. What is going to happen? Again, we have been left up in the air.</p><p>In fact, the question really needs to be answered, because the levy is to be made on copper lines. Will the many people who already have fibre optic and wireless technology&#8212;and who have the fastest broadband service&#8212;have to pay under the \"Digital Britain\" proposals, or will it be those whose service is provided along the poorest, longest and thinnest copper wires? I am very concerned about that.</p><p>As far as extending 3G mobile coverage is concerned, we should be able to tap into what has happened, for example, in the Faeroes, which receives its service from a fibre optic cable that goes from Scotland up past Orkney and Shetland. However, there are no proposals in that respect in \"Digital Britain\".</p><p>Above all, we have to recognise that the STUC was right when it said that the level of funding in Scotland must be increased, and we need to find some realistic way of securing that. I am sure that <place-holder colnum=\"23436\"/> the Scottish Government will serve the Scottish interest but I hope that the HIE report, which will be published in April, contains some practical solutions to these problems, and not a wish list such as the one that is set out in \"Digital Britain\".</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20544553", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadband Availability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Peter Peacock on giving us a chance to talk about broadband in the context of the \"Digital Britain\" report.

About 30 years ago, when I was a guidance teacher, we expected the establishment of a chemical processing factory on ground near Nigg in Easter Ross and we discussed with the company involved and with agencies what relevant skills youngsters should develop in schools. The factory did not come about, but the point is that Skills Development Scotland needs to start with schools in having a view of the economy as a whole and aiming at industries that are likely to expand and to require apprentices.</p><p>Members, including Margaret Smith, have said that the house building industry has had some problems, but the number of schools, hospitals, roads and railways that are being built means that large parts of the civil engineering industry have been employing and increasingly using our workforce.

Four fifths said that they see the internet as a vital tool, of which broadband is seen to be a key part. Two thirds believe that their provision is inadequate. Four fifths believe that they are underserved. Nearly half use broadband facilities for both business and personal use. That snapshot of the north and west of Scotland shows how important it is that rural areas are able to take part in the economy of the whole country&#8212;but, as the figures show, they are disadvantaged. In the postcode area for north-west Sutherland, my questionnaire had a 30 per cent response rate.

Murdo Fraser has mentioned some of them; I shall highlight one other. One survey respondent said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I do not believe that I am any more entitled to superfast broadband than anybody else in the country. Just equally entitled.\"</p><p>That response raises an issue about the limited choice of providers in rural areas. Given that BT, on which many rely, is prepared to levy in the cities a charge that is commensurate with the speed of the broadband service, why should BT be allowed to charge people in rural areas for 8 megabits per second when many get only 0.5 megabits per second or 1 megabit per second? Should there not be a sliding charge for people in rural areas in recognition of that? Of course, that is hardly a solution, but the issue is a sore thumb that sticks out. People complain about the price that they pay for the service.</p><p>To some extent, the same point applies to the Avanti scheme, which was a well-meaning way of dealing with people who are further from exchanges. That issue might be partly dealt with by increasing the strength and quality of each exchange, but folk who are close to Perth, Dingwall, Inverness and other large centres face difficulties, as they are outwith the range of the system that is in place at present.</p><p>We have to think about what sort of services people need.

I appreciate the move forward that has been announced today, but I would like our Government to say to the regulators and BT that they have to sit up and listen and provide the next step.

I saw that part of our built heritage, which still has a huge part to play in Scotland's story, exemplified on a recent journey that I made to Durness. Questions have been raised about the listing of pre-clearances villages and about interpretation facilities there. Discussions about the diaspora that took place during the Highland homecoming festival focused people's minds on exactly what it is that VisitScotland does to preserve and interpret such sites. A good example of interpretation work is that which has been done by the Mackay country group, which has established a township trail at Ceannabeinne, which is an abandoned village from the 1840s near Durness. The group has asked me to establish the status of such ruined villages in listings of ancient monuments by Historic Scotland. There are many that we have to ask about, and for various reasons.</p><p>I have written to the Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution on this matter before, but I raise it in today's debate because it gives us an example of a situation in which a local group is collaborating with various agencies to celebrate, promote and interpret something that is central to the history of a place and which can help to explain why there are so few people there today.</p><p>We must not forget the relationship between buildings and the people who made the societies that created them in the first place. That is a point that Historic Scotland, the National Trust for Scotland and so on could make a good deal more of. In every part of Scotland, particularly in the Highlands and Islands, there are dozens of such sites. Historic Scotland has done much good work to celebrate prehistoric sites such as the world heritage areas of Orkney. However, villages that were inhabited for centuries before the clearances forced their people to scatter need action. I have visited and written about many of those villages. Good examples include Lorgill, near Glendale in Skye; Rossal, in Strathnaver; Badbea, on the Ord of Caithness; and Crakaig, near Calgary in Mull.</p><p>We could find examples throughout the lowlands, the Borders and the Highlands of those sorts of villages, which have now just about sunk to the bottom layer of stones, but which represent a part of our built heritage whose integrity it is important that we maintain.</p><p>I look forward to renewed efforts by Historic Scotland to safeguard such sites from inappropriate development and to prepare appropriate interpretation of these key parts of our history. However, I have yet to see that happen. <place-holder colnum=\"21059\"/></p><p>Indeed, issues to do with inappropriate developments close to such sites are faced by every country in every age. Think about the huge standing stone monuments at Carnac in Brittany. People there encountered such difficulties in protecting them that they eventually had to fence them off, which removed a lot of the beauty of the ancient sites. Many places in Scotland suffer from the same sort of inappropriate development, which must be tackled.</p><p>The problem with the National Trust for Scotland and Historic Scotland is that they are obviously interested in developing the places to which they can charge admission. However, many of the places that tell the story of our history are the sort of ruins that I have been talking about rather than the substantial houses from which those bodies make their income.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20370795", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Historic Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wish to talk about some of the bits of our built heritage that are in the greatest danger: abandoned villages and buildings.

He is to be congratulated whole-heartedly on bringing this debate to Parliament in an attempt to simplify the means of finding a clear line of responsibility to meet Scottish conditions. It is obvious from his evidence that the regulatory bodies did not take seriously the Cullen inquiry and that FAIs in Scotland must be central to the way in which we address the matter. Transparent records and responses are needed. An FAI can provide those and may follow them up. I would like to know, for example, what effect Network Rail's placing of cameras at the Dingwall crossings has had on driver behaviour. I could ask many other questions, but that is important to know.</p><p>It is also necessary to ask questions of Network Rail. It provided us with a briefing that says that it spends more than &#163;80 million improving the safety of level crossings each year. How much of that &#163;80 million is spent on the most vulnerable crossings? In addition, we need to know how much of the millions of pounds that Network Rail claims it spends on maintenance and renewal <place-holder colnum=\"21026\"/> programmes is spent on the most vulnerable crossings.</p><p>There are problems for drivers and rail passengers. In particular, train drivers are often traumatised because of an accident in which a car, bus or lorry is hit by a train. They take that with them throughout their lives, which is why the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers instituted a voluntary code for drivers to slow down over crossings such as the one at Halkirk. That raises the question of the length of the journey that rail passengers have to take. The journey between Wick and Inverness is already at least four hours long, and it is essential that the voluntary slow-down does not become permanent; it is an initial response to show that train drivers are trying to help. At the same time, rail passengers are further disadvantaged by such incidents. That needs to be considered carefully, because fewer passengers will use the rail service if it remains so slow.</p><p>We need to seek a safe environment for rail and road users alike. Network Rail must do much more than it has done. It says that it seeks to develop, in the plans that run alongside last year's media campaign,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"solutions which could lead to the replacement of some crossings\".</p><p>It must start in the north of Scotland and it must start this year.</p><p>The case is strong and I welcome the debate.

I am delighted that there has, perhaps as a result of the work of Roseanna Cunningham and Maureen Watt, been a change of heart this session and the issue has been placed centre stage, where it should have been years ago.</p><p>It has aye been that way, of course&#8212;certainly, the Opposition has aye been that way.</p><p>Now, increasingly large numbers of people want to live in the countryside. Some, as Elaine Murray said, want to live there because they see being homeless in the countryside as a route to getting housing, as the points system might work more in their favour there than it does in cities.</p><p>Of course, it used to be that lots of people lived in the countryside. The ruins of past settlements show that there were, in the past, large inhabited areas. There should be an ability to live in the countryside for all the best reasons. The complex issues about having enough houses, being able to live where one wants and being able to have the kind of house that is fit for this century are central to the arguments that we have been making in this report, which I&#8212;as a slight outsider to the committee&#8212;am delighted to welcome.<place-holder colnum=\"20319\"/></p><p>On local planning, zoning has arisen in various members' speeches. The restructuring of zoning for affordable housing is interesting because if we zone particular landowners' properties as being for affordable housing, they know that the land price will not be the same price that they would get on the free and open market. We should examine that carefully, because it might be one route to making more land available. The culture change, which member after member has mentioned this afternoon, is at the root of the ability to repopulate our land.</p><p>I will first put the issue in a Highland context; people were able to continue to live in crofting areas&#8212;I will return to the detail of croft housing in a minute&#8212;because those areas had a form of protected tenancy. Crofting areas make up only 25 per cent of the Highlands, and were first set up in 1886. Gladstone's Land Bill was opposed by the Land League at that time, because it did not make available the land that the highlanders used to live in. It shovelled people into small corners, and they had to learn to cope with living in those small areas and with the pressures that it put them under.</p><p>Several members have made the point about the way in which village envelopes and planning zones are now described. When local plans come up for production, the proposals are put forward by the planners, who have an holistic view&#8212;in theory&#8212;about how settlements ought to operate, and why it is more economic to have people living in small areas so that dwellings can be serviced more easily. We have to challenge that view; the SNP believes that there are issues around the way in which village envelopes are currently structured, and that that has to change. Why should a person have to have a job in agriculture to live and work in the countryside? We must find a way around that.</p><p>I will give one example of why I believe that that authoritarian culture must be tackled at its root, and quickly. I know a man called Henry Murdo, who is the chairman of the Housing Initiative for Arran Residents. He lives on the Isle of Arran&#8212;I believe that members of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee met him on their visit there&#8212;and he has been trying to get a house for his son next to his own house, which is in a small settlement two or three miles from Brodick pier. The planners from North Ayrshire Council have refused time and again, and in June this year they told him:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The applicant has agitated for affordable housing on the island; however, it is considered that a dwellinghouse on this site would not appeal to a person seeking such housing. Its remoteness and the desirability for mechanised transport would detract from its appeal. There are no locational requirements for such a dwellinghouse and the granting of this application would create a precedent, which is considered to be undesirable.\"<place-holder colnum=\"20320\"/></p><p>That goes to the heart of what we are up against; that sort of attitude appears, in one fashion or another, in the directions of planning officials to people who are trying to live in their own land. We must take the committee's report seriously, and the Government must find a way to instruct planners to change that attitude.</p><p>I know that a small amount of change is currently taking place to increase the potential for people to live in the countryside, but that gives rise to the question of design. The committee's report mentions the unplugged house, which is an excellent idea. Of course, all houses in the past, in the 18<sup>th</sup> century and before, were unplugged. We do not want to live in the conditions that people live in did then, but it is now possible, using modern methods, for us to design such houses.</p><p>I am delighted that the Scottish housing expo will feature many designs that can be used in rural and urban areas, and which are not more expensive than the types of houses that are currently built by large builders. I am also delighted that the Scottish Government is supporting the housing expo, and I look forward to seeing those designs and examples multiply, as they are doing. There is not yet wide recognition of such designs, so the expo is very important.</p><p>It is interesting that the best designs are often produced by design-and-build organisations: architects who work with builders. The large bodies that build houses on a production line are not clued into that. The Government's attempts to give loans to those who wish to build greener homes, to green their homes or to put in home insulation are great ideas, but there is too little money for that at the moment, and we have to hope that it can be increased in the future.</p><p>There are many other aspects to the debate, but I will end by focusing on croft housing. It is possible to use much of the land that crofters have at the moment. I refer to their common grazings, not to the good land, where we should be growing more food locally. It is going to be possible, I think, for planners to see those areas of the countryside as a new source of available land.</p><p>It is also important to note good practice. For example, at Quarff, which is just south of Lerwick on Shetland, the council and the local grazings committee have reached agreement on use of such land, and housing of excellent quality has been provided. That is the kind of thing that breaks through the difficulties of the shortage of land.</p><p>In accepting the report, we should recognise the urgency of the matter, which is summed up by the example in which a person is trying to get a house for his son to take over his business in a rural area, but just because it is not a farming business, he is up against a council that is trying to stop him. <place-holder colnum=\"20321\"/></p><p>That has to stop.

The committee has considered a variety of choices that Scotland can make and what needs to be done quickly. As the committee convener, <place-holder colnum=\"20118\"/> Iain Smith, pointed out, we are part of a European energy market and it is important to see Scotland within that area of potential.</p><p>I argued in the committee that, in presenting the issue, we need to provide timelines for delivery that allow the public to understand what is possible within a given timescale. To take an obvious example, among marine renewables, offshore wind is the first technology that can be achieved within the next 10 years. Tidal energy and wave energy, which are being developed, will follow on from that. Therefore, it could be possible for us to have 180 offshore wind towers in the Moray Firth&#8212;and another group of a similar size off Inchcape&#8212;producing steady power for the grid in a shorter period of time than it would take to build a new nuclear power station. Given that change in the scale of what can be produced, people need to understand those timelines when they discuss fuel security and the like. Therefore, the committee's determination that Scotland's renewable energy sources are the main routes to follow is the correct decision.</p><p>Many members have highlighted the need for incentives, but few&#8212;apart perhaps from Peter Peacock&#8212;have mentioned the issue of community benefit. I raised the matter in the committee. Paragraph 124 of the report calls on the minister to consider whether the oil funds of Shetland and Orkney could be replicated for renewable energy developments. Such benefit must be based on throughput. If a particular island or part of land hosts some form of energy production, the place should gain some benefit from doing so. We need to work out a better way of doing that than planning gain, which is what we have at present. Such a system has yet to be developed, so I look forward to hearing how the Government will address that issue in future.</p><p>Among the bodies that we need to work with, the Crown Estate is important because it can play a key role in the development of offshore schemes. The Crown Estate points out that it cannot make final decisions on offshore wind until the Government has carried out the strategic environmental assessments, which it is hoped will be available in early 2010; I hope that they arrive on time. The Crown Estate also says that it has been involved in detailed and confidential evaluations with the firms that will take forward tidal and wave projects in the Pentland Firth. To allow that infrastructure to be built and the machines that will capture wave and tidal power to be developed, it is essential that the Crown Estate comes to a decision quickly on which firms it will enter into an agreement with. We must know those before the end of the year. Any hints that progress could be slower will hold up the process of achieving our desired aim.<place-holder colnum=\"20119\"/></p><p>The subject of Ofgem's approach to grid charges has been mentioned by many members. The committee believes that the Beauly to Denny line will play an important and central part in delivering much of the energy from the north of Scotland, so the decision on the line is awaited with great interest. On the issue of competition, it is important to reiterate the minister's point that it is clear that European competition law should not give rise to any kind of infraction proceedings. Therefore, we must ask whether the Scottish Government will now press that issue and whether the British Government will respond as quickly as possible. Highlands and Islands Enterprise points out, in relation to the production of energy from renewables in the north, that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Renewable electricity in Scotland accounts for around 2% of installed capacity in the UK but contributes 16% of transmission charges\".</p><p>Indeed, HIE continues:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"GB's charging methodology does not sit well within the context of neighbouring Member State charging regimes. It is much more expensive to send power from Scotland to England than it is from France to England. This is counter to moves, of which the UK is supportive, of promoting interconnectedness and a single European energy market.\"</p><p>That is why we need to view the Scottish process in a European context and call Europe's competition law in our aid.</p><p>Members such as Wendy Alexander and Ross Finnie have explored carbon capture and storage, and the minister has responded. There is a general feeling that carbon capture and storage fits. The committee is in favour of it, and we look forward to the Government progressing what is a strong recommendation from across the Parliament.</p><p>Another area that we discussed was planning skills. We were appalled to find that too many councils were incapable of providing reasoned argument on how proposals for onshore wind farms, for example, would be dealt with when it came to the crunch. We believe that pre-planning processes must be instituted and that councils in Scotland must share skills. Means must be made available whereby the concerns that people have about public hearings rejecting proposals can be diminished as a result of a change in the process. The evidence that the committee heard shows that it is essential that action is taken on that.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20200102", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Question Time &#8212; Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body: \"Determining and delivering on Scotland's energy future\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The determination of the debate on Scotland's energy future has been that there are choices to make.

At a time of flattened demand, there is a difference between the sales progress of white and brown spirits. As Wendy Alexander said in the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee on 9 September:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The issue then was the loss of brown spirits to white spirits&#8212;demand was growing much more quickly for vodka than for whisky\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee</em>, 9 September 2009; c 2340.]</p><p>We have to ask ourselves what Diageo's priorities are. In August, it stated that net sales had increase by 15 per cent. Smirnoff sales were up 17 per cent, Captain Morgan sales were up 29 per cent and Johnnie Walker sales were up 4 per cent. The debate must take into account the effects of Diageo's priorities on the company's thinking and on people throughout Scotland.</p><p>A farmer who lives close to me, Hector Munro of Foulis, said in a recent letter that there are</p><p class=\"indent\">\"large surpluses of malting barley in both UK and Europe plus World grain stocks\"</p><p>are</p><p class=\"indent\">\"generally higher than they have been at any time in the past decade ... Faced with this scenario and with no regional protection for Scottish malting barley, the vital ingredient of that iconic-branded product, Scotch Whisky\",</p><p>which he grows, his business is in doubt. We need to take account of the way in which Diageo's demand for products affects people such as our barley farmers.<place-holder colnum=\"19694\"/></p><p>Diageo has a range of distilleries, including 15 small distilleries in Speyside. In volume terms, they do not add up to the production of its main competitors&#8212;Glenfiddich or the Macallan&#8212;hence the idea of developing Roseisle. Will we see a consolidation of malt whisky distilling if world demand for brown spirits continues to move more slowly than demand for white spirits?</p><p>As a Scottish distiller, Diageo needs to show sustained loyalty to the complete process of whisky distilling in Scotland. As Wendy Alexander also said at committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The right analogy is with French wine production, and the real issue, which the GMB raised, is whether bottling in Scotland is compelled. Because of the influence of some of the large players in the industry, the Scotch Whisky Association does not support bottling in Scotland, which is astonishing ... The big strategic decision on whisky is whether there is a move to insisting on its being distilled and bottled here. It is interesting that the trade body for Scotch whisky does not favour that position.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee</em>, 9 September 2009; c 2341.]</p><p>This is the danger in which we find ourselves.</p><p>Can we in the Highlands and Islands expect to see consolidation in malt distilling, as has happened with grain distilling? When Guinness took over DCL, it said that it would not cut the number of distilleries. However, the question of cutting the number of distilleries in regions of Scotland and consolidating production has not been removed.</p><p>With mega-distilleries replacing the diverse regional nature of our iconic whisky industry, Diageo has to be asked what positive legacy it will leave for Scotland. Is what is good for the Diageo business model also good for Scotland? What level of value will be retained in Scotland? As a previous speaker said, that must be maximised.</p><p>I am concerned when Diageo makes statements such as:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The company has created a flavour map to categorise whisky by taste rather than region in an attempt to demystify the drink and attract new customers.\"</p><p>Scotland wishes to retain the regional nature of whisky production and bottling.

We can spend it if we like, but if we do it will cut our block grant.</p><p>Given that that is the case, we are looking to our friends in the Opposition, who have a hotline to ministers in London, to get access to that money so that it can be used for recovery purposes, by which I mean the development of renewable energy.

The Secretary of State for Scotland, Jim Murphy, is to visit the far north on 1 October, when he is set to address the regeneration partnership.

Will such incentives be provided through the return of the fossil fuel levy to us?</p><p>There is a need to look again at the problems of providing access to the grid for the renewable energy that is to be developed. Ofgem has held up the process by charging Scots 10 times more than people in parts of the south-east of England. We know that Ofgem has tried to offload responsibility for creating a new grid access regime on to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Will Mr Murphy tell us whether he has achieved that by convincing one of his colleagues down south to help us out?

It is important that we seek ways to improve the quality of such things. The UK Government has considered zero carbon emissions from all new houses by 2016. The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 is also to the fore.

We have taken evidence from some eminent legal brains. It was quite a change for committee members to watch witnesses arguing with one another about aspects of the bill. That was more than entertaining&#8212;it was enlightening, because it showed in which ways the bill probably needs to be improved.</p><p>As we have heard, there was cross-party support on the committee for the general principles of the bill. We recognise that the existing legislation on arbitration is cumbersome and often quite elusive, as so little of it is codified in statute; it is a deterrent to using arbitration as a means of dispute resolution in Scotland. Without a reform of the law, the use of domestic arbitration would most likely continue to dwindle and Scotland would remain unable to compete with other jurisdictions for international arbitration cases. However, as I said, the committee has a number of reservations about the delivery of the policy objectives of the bill. The two main areas that members will no doubt dwell on are the issues of minimising expense and ensuring that the process is efficient, and the economic benefits.</p><p>A key argument in favour of the bill is that it would minimise the expense associated with arbitration and ensure that the process is efficient. I agree with other members that that appears to be vital. As Gavin Brown eloquently explained, the bill must make arbitration cheaper and quicker.</p><p>While clear and consolidated legislation may make the law more accessible, the main provisions in the bill to promote the more efficient and cost-effective resolution of disputes are mandatory rules 23 and 24. However, I wonder whether there is a need for more than a duty on the tribunal and the parties to conduct arbitrations</p><p class=\"indent\">\"without unnecessary delay, and ... without incurring unnecessary expense.\"</p><p>In evidence to the committee, a number of witnesses referred to the tactics that parties will resort to in order to ensure that they achieve the result that they want. That raises the question of what remedies are available when an arbitration has not been conducted as quickly or as cheaply as possible, which is an important point for the Government to bear in mind when it considers any amendments that it might introduce at stage 2. The legislation needs to speed up arbitration and make it cheaper for the parties concerned.</p><p>From a general economic perspective, disputes have a negative effect on the Scottish economy. We all recognise the impact that consumer and commercial disputes have on individuals and businesses, especially as many of the smaller disputes remain unresolved. A modern, accessible arbitration system should offer an additional <place-holder colnum=\"18968\"/> means of resolving disputes more quickly and cheaply, thereby benefiting the Scottish economy. As has been pointed out, that was the practice in the past&#8212;particularly in the 19<sup>th</sup> century&#8212;and it worked perfectly well. Additionally&#8212;I suspect that this is a point that colleagues on the Justice Committee would recognise as important&#8212;if arbitration flourishes as a result of an improvement in the legislation, it could result in a reduction in pressure on the courts.</p><p>One of the key economic arguments behind the introduction of the bill has been that it will allow Scotland to compete internationally as a location for major arbitrations. From the evidence presented to it, the committee learned of the value that arbitration brings to major cities throughout the world. Even a limited number of international arbitrations would be of value to the Scottish economy. However, it cannot be taken as a given that a modern arbitration law will, of itself, attract large-scale international arbitrations to Scotland. While the committee is aware of the intention of the Scottish branch of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators to promote the bill should it complete its passage through Parliament, it is also of the view that more might be necessary to deliver any significant economic benefits to Scotland. The aim of attracting 10 per cent of the value of arbitrations carried out in London is laudable but I suggest that a coherent marketing strategy, as well as a considerable period of time, may be necessary to achieve that.</p><p>Members have dealt with several nitty-gritty issues, over which I will not tread again. We are generally agreed that we want amendments at stage 2 that will tackle the issues already raised. In conclusion, while I welcome the central purpose of the bill, I do so with a note of caution. We need to get the legislation right for it to be successful and for it to establish arbitration as a quick and economical means of resolving disputes in Scotland. I look forward to the minister's response to the concerns that have been outlined.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "19979903", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Arbitration (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a technical bill that has engaged the interest primarily of the legal profession, rather than the trade associations or industry bodies that are the usual suspects that appear before the   Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee.

That brings me to my first point, which is that festivals and culture need to be celebrated more in our media. We talk about people's right to see particular international football matches on terrestrial television, but I believe that some of our cultural phenomena ought to be available to us as well, and not in the middle of the night. I hope that the Government will take up the free-to-air issue with the UK Government. Parts of the Edinburgh festivals, Celtic Connections and so on deserve to be shown for more than half an hour late in the evening.</p><p>The celebration of various parts of the country is epitomised by the fact that people like to have a good time. I suspect that we have developed festivals that try to make things better for us in a harsh climate. I hope that the climate will not be too harsh the weekend after next in Wick, where HarbourFest has been resurrected. It was started in 1937 and has taken place occasionally since then. It raises the aspirations of Wick folk for the importance of the historic harbour and its future. It was such a fantastic celebration two years ago that it was decided to try to make it a regular event. Indeed, it is hoped that, eventually, sailing ships and others will join us in the north and use the string of marinas that has opened up, and that HarbourFest will be a part of that.</p><p>I want to talk about some other aspects of the way in which festivals are affected. Recently, I was involved in trying to get publicity and access to this country for a Canadian musician called Allison Crowe. We have problems with the UK Border Agency, which demands particular certificates of sponsorship and so on. That is extremely draconian, particularly for small festivals. The Edinburgh International Festival might have exemptions, but it is important that we go back to the new Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, and ask him to change the laws for artists, because the rules cut down the opportunities to get a variety of people from around the world to take part.</p><p>Thinking about festivals, we need to plan ahead. In a recent motion, I proposed:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament recalls the birth of Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham on 24 May 1852\"</p><p>and celebrates the 160<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his birth in 2012. I look to the Government to help us to think how best to celebrate that amazing, multitalented <place-holder colnum=\"18637\"/> Scot. Thinking along similar lines about a man who spoke at Bannockburn, we should consider the current state of the Bannockburn experience, over which the National Trust for Scotland has control. It will be a sin if we do not have world-class facilities to celebrate by the 700<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn in 2014. The planning for that must start now.</p><p>This afternoon's debate on festivals is an opportunity to consider how we measure their success. VisitScotland tells us that its perfect day campaign had a public relations value of &#163;2 million.</p><p>Part of the problem is that we need to standardise things. In a recent Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee meeting, it was pointed out that patterns of activity in the years before and after festivals need to be considered before differences can be measured. Measuring the success of the year of homecoming will be difficult because of that. Nevertheless, the small investment in the year of homecoming has been welcomed throughout the country. I see that at festival after festival, some of which I have taken part in.</p><p>I want to mention a couple of those festivals and to look forward again. The local authorities that control the 96 or so inhabited islands in Scotland are planning a festival of island cultures in 2011. That is a natural follow-on from the year of homecoming. I hope that the whole Parliament and all the parties can get behind celebrating that particular aspect of our lives, and that we ensure that we invest in that festival to give islands their place in the future.</p><p>I get the chance to go to many festivals, and I was an organiser for a traditional music festival in Dingwall for 20 years, so I know quite a lot about how festivals are run and how tight money is. If people in particular areas want to celebrate, it is up to them to make the most of what is available and ensure that they take part in festivals. It is a great joy to me that Hands Up for Trad will host an awards event in Dumfries at the end of the year of homecoming. That event is now a celebration of all traditional culture and the festivals that take place throughout the year. It is one of the best things that can happen and is a great way to close the year of culture.</p><p>I hope that we not only continue to celebrate, but consider what has worked and what should work in the future, and that we plan well for the festivals that celebrate our life in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "17369540", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Festivals"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Our opportunity to debate festivals and their success in Scotland is a valuable contribution as we look towards the future, celebrating place and aspects of human activity and the life of our communities.

It is of long-standing concern to me that officers in councils like to find big solutions to solve problems. One incinerator can deal with an awful lot of problems, but it creates large problems, too. Unfortunately, we are completely unclear what the strategy of the Liberal-led Highland Council is.</p><p>To illuminate that further, I will provide an example. Since 2000, the Golspie Recycling and Environmental Action Network has ensured that it has had the highest level of collection and recycling of waste from kerbsides of anywhere in Scotland. That has been supported by several tranches of the council. The network offers recycling to 75 per cent of east and central Sutherland residents and has achieved an 82 per cent participation rate. It provides 17 full-time jobs and two part-time jobs, some of which have gone to people who would find it hard to get employment otherwise. It brings in &#163;400,000 to the local economy every year, which, for 2,500 <place-holder colnum=\"18389\"/> people, is very important. It extends its work so that the range of items that it recycles is greater than the range of items that the council collects at present. It can offer a similar collection service for businesses.</p><p>We must ask whether, if the proposed incinerator at Invergordon, some 20 miles from Golspie, is built, Highland Council will immediately cancel its arrangement with GREAN, because a stream of waste will be needed to fill the incinerator. We must ensure that councils, including the one in whose area I live, do not replace best practice with a far worse option. Councils need to consider what voluntary bodies and social enterprises can do that councils have not been able to achieve. Such thinking is fundamental to our ability to take forward a low or zero waste strategy.</p><p>If 25 per cent of waste in Scotland is to be dealt with in modern incinerators&#8212;the idea has the support in principle of the Sustainable Development Commission Scotland&#8212;where should those incinerators be? There are proposals to build incinerators in Peterhead, Invergordon, Dunbar, Irvine, Glenfarg, Elgin and Dumfries. What is the strategy behind the proposals? Have those towns gone for the idea because it seems to be a commercial possibility?</p><p>As the consultation on the national waste management plan is developed during the summer, we must ask questions that enable us to ensure that recycling and reuse groups such as GREAN, and not incinerators, are the top priority.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "16658844", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Waste Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to home in on the issues surrounding how each local authority area reduces the amount that we put out as waste and how they deal with each part of that.

The fact that commercial organisations have taken such action out of concern for bees raises the question what discussions have taken place in Europe about the pesticides that have been used. We need much more scientific research on the matter, and I am delighted that the Scottish and UK Governments are starting to undertake it.</p><p>I note, too, that the EU Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has launched its own so-called plan bee and is trying to find the best means of securing EU funds to implement it. The plan has not entirely been agreed, but the committee hopes that it will include developing research into the parasites and diseases that are devastating hives; setting up ecological pollen and nectar-rich recovery zones like, for example, that proposed for Colonsay; promoting necessary measures to combat the threat of inadequate pollination; monitoring and controlling the quality of surface water; and providing financial aid to apiaries that are in difficulty.</p><p>We can learn from knowledge gained not just in Britain but in many other countries. Although I can never remember how to spell the word, it has been many years since we all discussed the varroa mite in the <em>Press and Journal</em>. Someone had been foolish enough to bring a beehive from an infected part of Yorkshire, I believe, to Brora. Because they did so in February, the bees died&#8212;unfortunately&#8212;but we should at least be thankful that they were not allowed to infect the area to which they had been taken. Since then, varroa, which as yet we have no means of combating, has moved north. I agree with Peter Peacock that it is highly important that we spend money on scientific research to tackle it.</p><p>With regard to habitats, we need to find ways of encouraging people to grow more flowers. After all, as members who grow vegetables will know, flowers attract various beneficial insects, and I suggest that the potager approach to gardening will be all the more important in that respect.<place-holder colnum=\"17654\"/></p><p>The impact of bees was discussed a number of years ago during the genetically modified oil seed rape trials on the Black Isle. At that time, people flagged up the danger of bees being able to fly for miles and to distribute pollen&#8212;in this case, genetically modified pollen, the effect of which has not yet been scientifically proven&#8212;in areas where we did not really want it to go. Bees have beneficial effects, but if they fly in the numbers that they have in the past, they can affect other plants in other ways.</p><p>I hope, however, that this debate has a positive tone. As the motion makes clear, we want the science to kick in. Although we in the north of Scotland might be lucky in being the last in the queue for the varroa mite, we cannot be complacent. We must ensure that we can strengthen the bee population, and I think that the proposal for sanctuaries in areas such as Colonsay should be extended to other parts of the country.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15010321", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bees"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the fact that Peter Peacock has secured this debate.

I will start on the Plains of Abraham. After the battle, a Gaelic-speaking Scots Highlander on the British side received the surrender from a Gaelic-speaking Scots Highlander on the French side. We should not forget, however, that General Wolfe said of the Highlanders that it was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"no great mischief if they fall.\"</p><p>The Canadian support for this country in our time of need in the past is one thing; the British Government's support for the Highlanders at that time was not in evidence. They were being used as mercenaries.</p><p>We talk about multiculturalism, and the Labour amendment is about</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland's cultural diversity in a modern Scotland\".</p><p>There is an interesting sidelight to that in the North American context. Ted Brocklebank mentioned the interest of Bob Dylan, who used the tune from the song about Lord Franklin for one of his early famous songs. Lord Franklin, who led the expedition to find the north-west passage, left from Stromness in Orkney. Of course, he got lost. The great Dr John Rae, who was himself from Orkney, was commissioned by the British Admiralty to try to find out what had happened&#8212;this was in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Living with the Inuit, like many fur traders who brought back the riches of the Canadian west through the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company, John Rae reached the point where the Inuit could show that the Franklin expedition had been lost.</p><p>Interestingly, and to put it in a multicultural sense, John Rae was not welcomed when he reported on the matter on return to London. The people there would not believe the Inuit who had pointed out that the Franklin expedition had ended up decimated by the ravages of leaded tins&#8212;which they had not known about&#8212;and of cannibalism, when they had gone mad. Lord Franklin's wife would not accept it. To this day, there is a statue in London praising the fact that Lord Franklin found the north-west passage. It was <place-holder colnum=\"17537\"/> actually John Rae who found the north-west passage. There is perhaps a need for the Labour Party to help us, using whatever influence it has in London, to get the statues there changed to show the truth. That would be a great help, and it would extend the multiculturalism of Scotland in this day and age. That link is an important one to make. Members should all see the brilliant Canadian documentary on the subject to appreciate how Scots learned to live with the natives in North America and were able to pursue the fur trade because of it. They did not die using the most modern methods of the day.</p><p>The cultural trade goes both ways. I am delighted that we have the transatlantic sessions at Celtic Connections, where we celebrate the music of both sides. There is much of that now, unlike in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, when it was a one-way ticket. However, it is even better to note that the principal magazine of traditional music, folk roots and world music in Canada, <em>Penguin Eggs</em>, is edited in Edmonton by a man from Dingwall in Ross-shire who is part of our diaspora; Roddy Campbell has made a great job of bringing together the French and English parts of music in Canada.</p><p>Interestingly, in the issue of the magazine that I have there is a review of Billy Kay's book \"The Scottish World: A Journey into the Scottish Diaspora\" by a long-time Scots exile in Canada, Enoch Kent. Kent writes that Kay's personal travels in Canada are \"interesting\" and quotes Kay:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"No country in the world has been so profoundly influenced by the Scots as Canada, and the influence stems from ordinary humble folk to the great and the good of this huge country\"</p><p>That is an enormous gift that we have given to the world. Indeed, it is useful for us to draw on some of the ideas that they were able to develop there. Let us not forget the Alberta oil fund that was set up when oil was being developed there, or the Alaska permanent fund, which has been giving people there $2,000 a head. The idea of using their non-renewable energy sources to support and improve their own communities is something that we could desperately do with having learned a good deal earlier in this country.</p><p>In the modern sense of energy, the competition or collaboration with people in Nova Scotia who are trying to develop tidal power at the moment is an important way to the future. The Bay of Fundy contains great potential there, as does the Pentland Firth in our country. I am glad to say that the competition will be to the good of the whole world because while we have installed a 2MW tidal device off Eday in Orkney&#8212;the first to serve the grid&#8212;the Nova Scotians are about a year behind us. However, they have Irish help and <place-holder colnum=\"17538\"/> there will be a huge international competition in tidal power that will allow us to be able to help other people in the world eventually by exporting our technology when we perfect it. I hope that we win, but I wish the Canadians good luck also.</p><p>In talking about the potential for the future, we should not forget the past. It would be terrible if we did not recognise how people in Canada and the United States look to Scotland in a cultural sense. As Ted Brocklebank said, the blood is strong.

Before that, he lectured at the University of Strathclyde in the 1970s, where he wrote about his concerns for the planet.</p><p>In his groundbreaking book \"The Politics of Environment: Including a Guide to Scottish Thought and Action\", which was published in 1972, he examined how modern technology was being exploited by an irrational economy of</p><p class=\"indent\">\"unlimited industrial expansion in limited space\",</p><p>which, as the blurb in his book states,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"must inevitably destroy itself, the land, the community and very probably, hazard the future of mankind\".</p><p>He was an inspiration to many of us in the SNP, an eco-hero who will not be forgotten. His message appeals across party lines, so it is most fitting that in addressing the challenges of climate change, the bill puts practical steps in place to reduce radically greenhouse gases, a science which was in its infancy and of which Malcolm <place-holder colnum=\"17265\"/> Slesser was only beginning to be aware in the 1970s.</p><p>We need action plans to ensure that Scotland shows a lead to other nations by taking our full share of the fight against climate chaos in time for the Copenhagen conference in December. I want to focus on a couple of issues that can make a real difference via the bill. Scotland has many advantages in playing its carbon-busting part. We now know how blessed Scotland is with the largest proportion of high winds, big waves and strong tides in Europe. That gives us a huge economic opportunity to contribute to the UK contribution to the EU's 2020 targets. Tidal and wave power in the Pentland Firth will follow on from the huge arrays of offshore wind turbines to provide secure and safe green power to ourselves and our neighbours to the south and across the North Sea.</p><p>Heat represents more than 50 per cent of our energy needs in Scotland, yet heat generated from renewable sources represents less than 1 per cent of demand. A massive increase in the delivery of renewable heat will be required in the domestic and commercial sectors in the years ahead if overall targets for greenhouse gas emission reduction are to be met alongside the targets for renewable energy. The further behind we get on delivering renewable heat, the steeper the targets will need to be in the electricity and transport sectors to meet overall energy targets, and the steeper the targets will need to be across the whole of society in order to meet climate change targets.</p><p>I therefore welcome the response from the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee's report, in which he pledged that the renewable heat action plan will contain a target to supply 11 per cent of heat demand from renewable heat by 2020 as part of the overall EU targets.</p><p>With regard to job opportunities from climate change mitigation, the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's conclusion on the financial memorandum in its stage 1 report discusses the Government's estimate that 16,000 jobs will be created in the field of renewable energy. Members were \"extremely concerned\" about the veracity of that estimate, but I am glad to say that at the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee yesterday we heard evidence that verifies that figure&#8212;indeed, we heard evidence from some who believe it to be a conservative estimate.</p><p>As a member who represents the Highlands and Islands and has a long-standing interest in land use and tenure, I agree with RSPB Scotland on the need for an holistic approach to rural land use. Scottish land plays a big part in our greenhouse <place-holder colnum=\"17266\"/> gas emissions. Emissions are falling slightly, but they must fall faster. Scottish risk impacts reports must be prepared for our Government, to complement the advice from the UK Committee on Climate Change. Particular features, such as the huge blanket peat bogs in the flow country in my region and our precious native pine woods, would then be subject to technical scrutiny from dedicated Scotland-based scientists. Such reports would provide that scrutiny and an annual reporting mechanism. Annual reporting is already provided for in the UK Climate Change Act 2008, and it should appear in our bill. I hope to hear from the minister on that.</p><p>I was privileged to visit Eigg last weekend to see its self-sufficiency drive for renewable energy for all houses on the island. From four windmills, a solar voltaic array and a run-of-river hydro plant, each home gets 5kW of electricity. Few in the cities could cope with such low amounts of electricity, but Eigg folk are leading the fight in limiting demand and securing clean energy supplies.</p><p>Malcolm Slesser would be proud that we, as members of the Scottish Parliament, are finding our way to the best means to stop climate chaos. Some 37 years ago, in \"The Politics of Environment\", he wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Modern technology need no longer be the servant of economics. It is now able to halt expansion-for-expansion's sake without entailing unemployment and recession. There is now no excuse whatever for trying to impose this servant 'economics' willy-nilly over the more biological, nourishing, attributes of human communities\".</p><p>The principles of the bill are world class, and the amendments at stage 2 must make it easier for Scots to adapt to climate change.

The east and west coast main lines from Scotland to London are at capacity. That is the fact that drives us forward to see the essential need for a new route, which we must start to build from both ends.</p><p>As other speakers have said, the benefit of such a route would be that it would pick up commuters who currently need to fly. According to the Department for Transport in London, between 2002 and 2006 some 64 per cent of journeys between Scotland and London were made by air. We need to reverse that, just as the French have done with their TGV between Paris and Marseille. Therefore, both Glasgow and Edinburgh need to be served by the new line. It cannot serve Edinburgh then Glasgow or the other way round. We need to look at the route carefully and think about the use of Carstairs on the way south.</p><p>Some important technical issues are raised by the report. At the present time, the continental <place-holder colnum=\"16624\"/> trains that might be best for such a route cannot fit on our railway system. Therefore, as well as building the new route, we need to adapt the railway system in other parts of the country to cope with those trains. I know that, to make it possible for certain sizes of container to be transported from Elgin to Mossend, Network Rail had to spend about &#163;4 million in accommodating bridges, lowering tracks and modifying particular parts of the line. We are not talking about a cheap piece of work, but we need the high-speed trains to be able to go far beyond the proposed high-speed line.</p><p>A second technical point is about the quality that is required on the new line. Over the past week or so, a campaign in <em>The Herald</em> has highlighted the problem of the quality of our railways. Anyone who has travelled on the Eurostar recognises that there is a step change in the customer experience. We need to ensure that we deliver that for high-speed travellers across the whole of Britain in due course. To bring high-speed rail to Scotland, we need to be able to promise people that they will receive that quality of service. Therefore, it cannot be the case that the service runs just from London to Birmingham.</p><p>As the committee convener mentioned, certain things can be done just now, including tackling the important issue of the fares structure. On the Eurostar, I have experienced situations in which only first-class seats are available on particular days. To attract people to use the railways, we must simplify the fares structure. We must not exploit people by charging them more on Fridays and then have them return on a terribly slow journey on a Sunday because weekends are notorious for interruptions to the service. If we are to have a high-speed rail system, it needs to be able to deal with those issues. It is appalling that First ScotRail currently allows a lucky few on the internet to book a &#163;19 single on the Caledonian sleeper to London while it charges 10 times that amount for a first-class seat and bed on the same route.</p><p>We have to have a simplified and cheaper system to get people travelling. We should sort out the present complexities now, so that when high-speed rail arrives, the system is much better. When my stepdaughter wanted to go to Inverness, she had to pay &#163;50 because a cheaper fare was not available. She then found out that if she travelled with three friends, she could get all four tickets on the same route, travelling on a Friday, for &#163;42. The present situation is an outrage and needs to be sorted out. I make those points in the context of a debate on the high-speed rail report because they have to be made. That is the background to the problems that we are trying to deal with.<place-holder colnum=\"16625\"/></p><p>Ultimately, Scots need to have a European rail network of a high standard, with a route that takes us from the north of Scotland through to St Pancras so that high speed 2 links up with high speed 1. That is what we were denied so long ago&#8212;a route that would join Scotland to the continent. High speed 2 is a means of doing that. UK policy must not be focused on rail travel between London and Birmingham. If the union means anything, it means that Scots should not remain at the end of the line. Instead of being served by a branch line, we should be in the main stream of Europe. The debate allows us to make progress in that direction.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14931820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High-speed Rail Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the clerks for bringing together an excellent report and for keeping us on the rails.

With the dramatic rise in food prices worldwide in 2008, adequate and lasting methods of agricultural production received a new impetus. Increasing extremes of weather create increasingly difficult conditions, yet yields must be increased. At the same time, agriculture must meet new demands for energy production as part of the attempt to reduce greenhouse gases. That challenge was discussed by Professor Jessel of the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, who said that all countries face the same problems. He argued for ecological and nature conservation solutions. He questioned whether biotechnological solutions such as genetic modification of plants <place-holder colnum=\"16412\"/> should contribute to the lasting protection of world food supplies.</p><p>Last year, the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development, the United Nations' agricultural equivalent of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, concluded that data on a range of genetically modified crops indicate highly variable yields. Although the IAASTD was reluctant to rule out genetically modified crops in future, it rightly concluded that, if the multimillion pound investment by corporations in transgenic research and development had been applied to improving conventional methods of local food production and distribution, the current world food crisis would have been more successfully addressed.</p><p>Small-scale farming and ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the current world food crisis. Just last week, we heard that non-GM drought-resistant maize is being planted in Malawi. Also, demand for non-GM soya in producer states in Brazil and Argentina, as well as the USA, is on the increase. Further, the largest dairy producer in Germany, Campina, insists on traditional feed methods using grass, rapeseed and lupins and has highlighted those conventional methods in a television advertising campaign. Its approach is a response to consumer demand across Europe and in many other nations that favour organic, local and conventional food.</p><p>In Scotland, the Scottish Crop Research Institute near Dundee has launched conventional plant breeding successes including an environmentally sound potato, Vales Sovereign, that needs less water and fertiliser than other varieties. It is also resistant to high levels of disease and is cheap and easy to grow. It was commercialised by Tesco.</p><p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has recently funded a five-year trial of lupins for livestock feed as a substitute for imported soya because the European Union livestock industry imports 77 per cent of its protein requirements, of which 98 per cent is soya bean meal from Brazil and Argentina, both of which are major producers of GM varieties.</p><p>Last year, the Scottish Agricultural College backed an international research collaboration called the green pig project, which plans to use home-grown legume varieties to reduce reliance on imported and expensive soya bean meal and so reduce costs for Scottish livestock producers. Further, the scientific analysis done by Dr John Fagan shows that although non-GM pig feed costs a bit more than GM feed, the actual cost per animal is lower when non-GM feed is used because of feed-to-meat conversion efficiency. I arranged for him to discuss his findings with <place-holder colnum=\"16413\"/> leaders of the National Farmers Union of Scotland last week here in Parliament, and I believe that trials could be replicated on Scottish farms.</p><p>Growers want blight-resistant strains. Indeed, in January's issue of <em>The Kitchen Garden</em> magazine, Colin Randel says that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"blight resistance ... is the 'holy grail'.\"</p><p>The new S&#225;rpo potato varieties, which were bred in Hungary and selected in Wales by the S&#225;rv&#225;ri Research Trust, have extremely high resistance to late-blight disease. There are two varieties on the United Kingdom national list: S&#225;rpo Mira and Axona. Several more with different end-uses are being trialled at present. Those new varieties have an exceptionally light carbon footprint and are able to resist viruses, smother weeds and resist drought. They can also be stored without refrigeration. They are, of course, conventionally bred and were trialled, as my motion indicates, in the Black Isle, near where I live.</p><p>Here is the rub, though: small, not-for-profit companies find it difficult to continue researching new varieties as governments have not provided enough support. S&#225;rv&#225;ri is said to benefit from royalties levied on sales of its seed potatoes. Big producers such as Caithness Potatoes Ltd under Jack Dunnett and the Scottish Crop Research Institute gain royalties as varieties are grown on larger and larger acreages, but even Caithness Potatoes Ltd barely survived in the early stages of breeding. Now, S&#225;rpo varieties will not earn substantial royalties until they are able to supply thousands of tonnes of seed. That will take several more years. In the meantime, funding is a never-ending problem.</p><p>This year, 70 tonnes of S&#225;rpo potatoes are being planted in gardens around the United Kingdom, but since commercialisation was privatised under the Tories 20 years ago, subsidies from sales to put into new plant development rely on commercial sponsorship, such as that received for Vales Sovereign, which bulked up sales from 25,000 tonnes of potatoes in 2008 to the more than 40,000 tonnes that are expected this year.</p><p>Here is the crunch of the debate. We have the research capabilities in Scotland. We have various crops that can provide food and fodder from conventional sources. We have a Scottish food and drink policy that supports the production of local food and the export of prime quality foodstuffs. Policy is needed to encourage the process from breeding to commercial production. Our top researchers can apply marker-assisted selection in the breeding process, which is a high-tech conventional means to develop robust strains.<place-holder colnum=\"16414\"/></p><p>Too often, research has been financed by the multinational biotech companies. Huge sums have been spent that have sown a mere 0.06 per cent of Europe's fields with non-food GM crops such as maize, cotton and oilseed. Worldwide, that amounts to a mere 2.4 per cent of cultivated crops. Such a poor return for such large financial inputs is obscene.</p><p>To echo Professor Jessel, we in Scotland support ecologically and socially acceptable solutions. Environmentally friendly methods are already available, which are sustainable, secure and increase yields through smart breeding. Those yields will contain many genes and depend on a complex of local conditions, such as ground and climate, and do not need transgenic transfer. Such conventional breeding methods promise not only less risk but cheaper solutions. We can provide jobs and food security by applying those methods in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14909408", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Conventional Plant Breeding"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I refer members to my entry in the register of interests, in which I have declared my membership of the Soil Association and the Scottish Crofting Foundation.

We must consider the green benefits of saving our environment and understanding, for example, the great carbon sinks that we have in the peat bogs of the north, particularly in the flow country.

Indeed, people who were pupils of Wick high school 15 or 16 years ago tell me that there were buckets on the floor and broken roof tiles then. Some of them said that when they were concentrated on learning it was <place-holder colnum=\"14874\"/> not too much of a problem for them, but in the long period since then there has been a decline in the condition of the dilapidated fabric, which must be investigated as Jamie Stone suggested.</p><p>I ask the minister to find out, if possible, why the fabric of Wick high school has deteriorated to its current state, which has forced concerned parents to go to the local MSP with their campaign for improvement.

Unbelievably, they left sharp edges that meant that children could not use the pool thereafter. At least there is a large swimming pool in Wick that Wick high school pupils and the public can use, so the situation is not as desperate as that in Thurso, where there is no swimming pool.</p><p>I ask that we try to get this matter into perspective and look to the minister to tell us how we can go ahead.

That is a natural condition in most countries&#8212;except this one. Although such powers would be constrained by our ability to meet the overall borrowing requirements and constraints of the state in which we work, it is essential that we are able to deploy them at this time.</p><p>Yesterday John Swinney said in his budget speech:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Challenging economic times require a country to draw on all the mechanisms at its disposal to assist recovery.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-02-04.14649.3\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 4 February 2009; c <a name=\"Col14652\">14652</a>.]</citation></p><p>We have only a few of the mechanisms that we require to assist the full recovery of Scotland&#8212;or, indeed, to run the country in normal times.</p><p>I will offer a couple of examples that concern me and demonstrate the problem. This morning, I read that Councillor David Alston, the Liberal finance spokesperson in Highland Council, deplores the potential need for 111 job cuts in the council due to budget constraints. He said that he would prefer a \"modest increase\" in the council tax, although that goes against the historic concordat to which he agreed. Nevertheless, those budget constraints are due to the excess charges for PPP that were racked up by a system that was forced on the council by the forms of borrowing used by central Government. That is the real culprit in this case.</p><p>Another example is the debate on the Forestry Commission's estate and our need to contribute to <place-holder colnum=\"14735\"/> tackling climate change. The Minister for Environment has proposed that we raise money by letting out parts of the estate to bring in cash for planting new trees. That is a classic case of the constraints of devolution forcing us down a route that we might not have wished to take, but which could be productive. Nevertheless, it is a problem.</p><p>There has been so much misinformation about the Scottish Futures Trust that we ought to look at it again in the context of today's debate. We must have aggregated borrowing requirements that make it possible to deploy our borrowing ability in the best way that we can.

If that is so, it need not be a constraint; indeed, it is a great benefit to be able to use that as the means to move forward.</p><p>The wider debate on the constitutional future of our country has taken place&#8212;through Calman, to an extent, but to a greater extent through the national conversation. There has been huge public involvement. People want us to have more powers so that we are able to live a normal life. As it is, having one hand tied behind our back every time we go out in the morning to try to deal with the government of Scotland makes the task very difficult indeed. That is why I am keen for non-profit distributing models to be part of the debate on borrowing powers.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament should have borrowing powers; we should build on them from the base up.

The audience was very much made up of Gaels who now live in the central belt. Listening to so many people singing the songs' choruses was fantastic. When we realise that singing is at the heart of Gaelic culture, we realise that that culture is much more special than the experience of certain parts of our country where people are quite tongue tied. That evening made me realise that different parts of Scotland bring different values to our culture, but that that singing culture&#8212;the concert got a four-star review&#8212;is special. I experienced the joy and pleasure that people get from singing in their own language. People have to experience that for themselves. During the year of homecoming, members should ensure that they at least go to a Gaelic festival or meet up with friends who go to such festivals. I am sorry to preach to people from Gaelic families or those who already do such things, but we should tell the rest of the world about how great such things are.<place-holder colnum=\"14586\"/></p><p>The Gaelic language plan inevitably falls into the different categories that have been explained. Finding out how we can improve things institutionally will take a wee while, but it is obvious that many people who are not Gaels themselves have moved to the G&#224;idhealtachd&#8212;the Gaelic-speaking areas&#8212;and they want their children to participate. They have seen the enthusiasm of Gaelic-medium education teachers and require the back-up services that help parents to learn Gaelic so that they can keep up with their children. If we want to create a whole community, parents who do not speak Gaelic but give their children the chance to learn it must also receive support. We must think about the current education services.</p><p>I am interested in the work that has been done on the Gaelic plan for Highland Council. There is an aim to create local Gaelic development plans, which community councils or other interested bodies could take up. Getting people talking about such things at a local level is great. I bear the scars of the consultation process on the national planning framework and know about the criticisms that have been made of that. Gaelic can set a very good example in that context. Support for the language can be built from the bottom up by encouraging people in many parts of the country to see its relevance to their community. I give an example from the area that I represent. In Caithness, which is in the north part of the Highlands&#8212;some people would say that it is beyond the Highlands&#8212;there is a degree of a jagged edge, but the word \"Caithness\" is half Norse and half Gaelic. Therefore, some parts of Caithness will be interested in Gaelic. Indeed, there will be a Mod there in 2010, which will mean that there will be heightened interest in Gaelic there. We must try to encourage debate on supporting Gaelic at local level.</p><p>I, too, greatly welcome BBC Alba. Some constituents who I met on the north coast and in other places over the Christmas period said, \"At last. I've got an environment in my home in which I can have Gaelic all day and evening.\" Such a service had not been available before. Thanks to the prevalence of television, they thought that they would start to notice a difference in how people live, as there is now parity of esteem that allows people to live their lives more through Gaelic than they were able to do before. That makes the investment in BBC Alba so important. We are talking about a small amount of money, but I hope that we can build on the service in the future.</p><p>It is obvious that the Gaelic language plan includes particular structural arrangements. In the Government's support policies for raising awareness and helping people to participate, it is clear that signage of all sorts, including road signs and logos, is important. At the moment, the cash-<place-holder colnum=\"14587\"/> strapped nature of things makes it difficult for such improvements to be made to the trunk road network, let alone for its maintenance to be done. We have to find ways of telling people that the money to pay for such road signage comes from a different pot from that which pays for holes in the road to be filled in. That needs to be done carefully if we are to avoid people making the nasty, jagged comparisons that they tend to make in such cases. I hope that we can do that.</p><p>I turn to press coverage of Gaelic. Last week, I was saddened to read in a Scottish newspaper a letter from a gentleman in Ayr who wrote, in Scots, that far too much money goes to Gaelic and none to Scots. Let us make it clear: it is not a case of having the one or the other. Scots speakers need a different prescription to that which Gaelic speakers need. Unlike Gaelic, Scots was not legislated against. The Education Act 1872 outlawed Gaelic from our lives. It is true to say that Scots was treated as slang. That said, the prescription for the two languages is different, but they are not mutually exclusive. I beg the chamber to ensure that that is the message that we send out in the year of homecoming to those who are celebrating Robert Burns. For example, we should recognise the fact that Lewis Macdonald's father translated Burns into Gaelic. There is no dichotomy between the interest of Scots and that of Gaelic. Let us celebrate both cultures to the full.</p><p>I welcome this consensual debate.

It was interesting that the European Parliament adopted a resolution on global food security that strongly affirms the importance of the common agricultural policy</p><p class=\"indent\">\"as the means to secure food production in the EU\"</p><p>and globally, despite long-standing criticisms of the policy's effects on farmers in the developing world.</p><p>The Labour Party should come clean about whether we are to continue to demand cheap food imported by air and other climate-busting means from farmers in developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. A balance has to be struck in the British mind between allowing a free market and protecting our interests to grow what we can here<em>.</em> Food security is central to what Scotland's contribution can be not just to Britain but to other parts of the world. We have to set that example in debates on how the common agricultural policy is working now and on what will succeed it. There has to be continued support for European farming, as our colleagues in the European Parliament said. That model of farming would allow Scotland to be on a par with other countries in Europe, perhaps to a greater extent than the British Government thinks should be the case.</p><p>I am interested in the Labour Party's interpretation of our co-operation with London and in the Tories' ideas that Labour will adopt their wishes for food security.

The report on that festival said that it was one of the most ambitious and complex cultural projects ever staged in the UK. Homecoming is more so.

We could insist that within five years, the British Government should not allow cars and lorries to be sold that cannot do more than 70 miles to the gallon. That would help us enormously.</p><p>The second method of reducing emissions lies in the development of rail. In that context, the infrastructure for inward investment and future major developments throughout Scotland come into sharp focus. My constituency office is in Wick, and I understand the difficulties of doing it all in 12 years, 20 years or whatever. We have inherited a situation in which nothing will have happened north of Stirling until this set of plans is in place. As the chambers of commerce have pointed out, the Highland main line has been dilapidated for a long while. I am delighted about the proposed improvements to loops and double-track sections, line gauge enhancement, new and improved signalling and more powerful traction through the investment of between &#163;50 million and &#163;100 million in phase 1, &#163;100 million to &#163;250 million in phase 2, and &#163;50 million to &#163;100 million in phase 3.</p><p>If Scotland is to be a modern country, the journey time for passengers who wish to go from the northern capital of Scotland&#8212;Inverness&#8212;to Edinburgh must be reduced by 35 minutes between Inverness and Perth and also reduced south of Perth. In the high-speed rail debate, it was recognised that there should be the potential for high-speed rail to go from London to not only Glasgow and Edinburgh but the centre of <place-holder colnum=\"13227\"/> Scotland, up towards Perth. If we started the high-speed rail link from both ends&#8212;from Scotland and from London&#8212;we could start seriously to improve travel times to the central belt, thereby reducing times to the far north. I hope that that will come into the plans in due course.</p><p>I have to mention important developments around Inverness. On the railways, Dalcross station has potential. Indeed, the SNP Government is ensuring that an hourly service to Inverness will be possible for the first time. That is an excellent result to go along with improvements to the Highland main line.</p><p>I hope that what I have to say about roads is equally helpful. We recognise the massive size of the job that has to be undertaken. We cannot shirk the fact that parts of the A9 require safety work.

Reference has been made to the image of salmon farming, which is improving considerably. However, we know that the market conditions for shellfish are very difficult at present. Given the fantastic resource of clean waters that we have, it is a great pity for the people who produce shellfish to see prices going down. In this period&#8212;the run-up to Christmas&#8212;there is a lot of evidence of difficulty. Prices are slow. French and Spanish dealers who would normally have struck deals for lobsters and other shellfish by this stage have not done so&#8212;they say that the Christmas season has not yet arrived. The credit crunch is affecting our European neighbours, as it is us. Orkney fishermen say that they are having difficulty selling cooked partans. We need to find the means to float companies in weeks 49, 50 and 51 of the year. If the price rises are not achieved then, many shellfish merchants will be in serious difficulty. We therefore hope for evidence of a change in the process for marketing shellfish. There is a period of low demand in January, and if <place-holder colnum=\"12660\"/> people have to keep over their stocks until then, they will not make money out of them.</p><p>Perhaps this is the time to stimulate the home market. Perhaps we should not, with all due respect, be eating turkeys at Christmas, but lobsters or shellfish&#8212;as people do in countries such as Portugal. That might be a good thing, because there are large stocks of them needing sold. We hope that there will be help with marketing through the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society, which claims to work with aquaculture and which should be given a chance to do more in that direction.</p><p>We have questions about the environment, which I am particularly interested in from the point of view of the proposed climate change bill. If, as RSPB Scotland suggests, the growing aquaculture industry is to be consistent with the Scottish Government's sustainable development strategy, we should perhaps ask the minister whether we could have some means of doing a carbon count of the effect of the aquaculture industry, as we do for other industries. Aquaculture is a good industry to choose for ascertaining whether or not it is environmentally sustainable. That fits well with how the forthcoming marine bill will take into account marine spatial planning and the best use of our extremely clean waters.</p><p>I hope that the debate focuses on some of the major factors that will help the aquaculture industry to develop. As we have heard, we now have a greater uptake of salmon. Perhaps that is because of the difficulties of getting other fresh stocks, which have been run down through overfishing in some parts of the world. More processed salmon is being eaten. Nevertheless, that is good for the Scottish industry at the top end.</p><p>I doubt that we have had enough global warming to develop the necessary climate for flying fish to reach this part of the world, as the Tories suggested, but who knows, they might be farmed in future.

All councils have thermal imaging equipment and it should be made available to everyone. We could take that first step without any plans or anything else like that. We found out where the thermal imaging equipment was in Highland Council, and it would be a good idea if every council area started to provide a thermal imaging service, because it triggers ideas about what needs to be done.</p><p>I could mention many other aspects of the energy challenge, which might be won by the person who most improved their house's energy efficiency capacity; we have yet to hear the results, which we look forward to with interest. We are building an extension that will include a solar panel, which will change our heating system, but that will not happen within the year of the competition.</p><p>We must think about how building regulations are applied. If the houses that we are building now are causing more problems for the future, we must bring that to an end, and the sooner the better.</p><p>I am more concerned about rural housing, tenemental property and non-standard retrofitting. We must find ways of pinpointing what can be dealt with. That presents an opportunity for a Government agency that is known for its inflexibility. Historic Scotland could set an example by allowing many of the places that are in United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization heritage sites, for example, to use modern methods. Why do we have to maintain Historic Scotland's buildings to standards that were set in the 18<sup>th</sup> century? That is crazy in this day and age. Such buildings need not look any different, but they could contain modern materials, and it is high time that we asked Historic Scotland to review its policy. Conditions such as those, near my office, in Argyll Square in Wick, which Jamie Stone and I know well, are ridiculous. That is the kind of thing that could be dealt with now.</p><p>The fact that 34 per cent of our energy demand comes from houses must be tackled head on. The Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee went to see London's green concierge service, which organises specialist advice for people who can afford to deal with their homes' energy efficiency problems, so that people can get on and spend the money.

An initiative that the Government took early in the summer was to provide a &#163;60 million support package to help around 1,500 first-time buyers in Scotland to find affordable homes. A second initiative, which has been much talked about, was the bringing forward of &#163;100 million for affordable housing investment, by taking money from other budgets. A third initiative was the plans for the central heating programme, which will provide help during the winter. In addition, the 100 per cent business rates relief from next April for tens of thousands of Scotland's smallest businesses will help many people.</p><p>I welcome those small, practical steps, which could be taken within the limits of the budget that we have and are part of a wider package from the SNP Government. The Government has given the matter the thought that it deserved. However, there are inhibitors. We live in an age of irresponsibility&#8212;Gordon Brown's irresponsibility. The IMF said that the UK economy will shrink by 1.3 per cent in 2009, as David McLetchie said. It is important to note that the UK's position will be worse than the positions of Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the USA and worse than the positions of Denmark, Norway and Sweden&#8212;countries against which we measure ourselves. If that is the case, we must find the means to argue for changes in Europe that will stop Gordon Brown calling for deregulation and bring us much better, smarter regulation, to help us get going again.</p><p>We are in an appalling situation. Mr Brown is about to break&#8212;big style&#8212;his golden rule of not borrowing more than 40 per cent of gross domestic product in an economic cycle. The <place-holder colnum=\"12263\"/> Britain in which we live has vast public borrowing requirements and debts and a culture of personal debt that is unprecedented in the western world. That is the backdrop against which we in Scotland have to deal with the problems.</p><p>If we consider how some of our smaller neighbours have dealt with banking crises in the past, we can note that their attempts to use their own resources&#8212;in the case of Norway, that means the oil funds that it has, which we could have had and which we could have in future&#8212;were based on ensuring that they dealt transparently with the problems. Commenting on the problems after the deregulation of banks in the 1980s and 1990s, the deputy governor of the Norges Bank said in December 2003:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Norwegian banking crisis was handled swiftly and transparently and at relatively low cost to the taxpayers. Furthermore, the banks that came out of the crisis had trimmed their operating costs and established much better systems to evaluate credit risks.\"</p><p>Is that approach being taken in Britain? Can we expect Scotland to sit by and watch our neighbours taking action and keeping down costs in their countries while we leave everything to the mercy of Gordon Brown in London? I think not.</p><p>We must focus on the potential for confidence that the SNP Government has been working on from before the early parts of the crisis and into the middle of it. The Government's six-point plan contains a couple of points that I want to examine.</p><p>The first, which was mentioned earlier, is retrofitting our homes. In an era of climate change, the idea of reducing fuel consumption, bills and wasted heat is central, and we are talking about how to help with affordable house building. I hope that the Government can find ways to help many householders improve their homes; if we can do so, we will have a use for apprentices and many construction industry skills in a difficult time. That would be helped by London making a cut in VAT from 17.5 per cent down to 5 per cent, as that would stimulate the construction industry to take part. That is something that we call for from the outside, but do we expect to get it? No, we do not&#8212;that is another inhibitor that we face.</p><p>Let me move from VAT to TVA&#8212;the Tennessee Valley Authority idea. We have massive energy potential in the north of Scotland. In the 1970s, we looked north for the oil boom and the construction jobs that came out of that. It is entirely possible that all that will happen again in future, and it is a case of \"Steady as we go\", because that is how we will drive our economy forward.

Karen Whitefield gave the example of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The impulse not to return to the poverty and misery of those years was a driver behind a family of UN declarations. With decolonisation came an important impetus to improve the situation throughout the world. However, we forget at our peril that there are still 250,000 children living in poverty in this country, 90,000 of whom are in dire poverty.</p><p>We must recognise that Scots have been at the forefront of the debate. Indeed, I shall quote a short poem by Sorley MacLean from the period around 1940, which has been translated into Scots by Douglas Young so that more people can understand it. Sorley MacLean said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"My een are nae on Calvary<br/> or the Bethlehem they praise, <br/> but on shitten back-lands in Glesca toun<br/> whaur growan life decays,<br/> and a stairheid room in an Embro land,<br/> a chalmer o puirtith and skaith,<br/> whaur monie a shilpit bairnikie<br/> gaes smoorit doun til daith.\"</p><p>The issue of growing life decaying is at the heart of the debate, and it is why the processes of children's rights throughout the globe have to be seriously addressed. If we are to have an action plan, and if we are to decide on priorities, what could come from the debate is the opportunity for the Parliament, in this four-year session, not only to try to deal with the actions that the Government has already taken but to guide some of its actions, for example by raising awareness of the declaration or by ensuring respect for the views of children.</p><p>I am a former teacher, and I do not think that our school system is fully geared up yet. There is a kind of dictatorship in which headteachers decide what happens, and the experience of how children's views are taken into account is mixed. Through the cabinet secretary's department, we could take measures to allow those views to be heard.</p><p>I was delighted to hear the examples from St Monans that the minister gave. Every school in the country should be adopting such principles. The boundaries of what people can do and what they cannot do have to be discussed.</p><p>George Foulkes said that the abolition of physical punishment in schools was important. I was part of the action group that helped to bring about abolition. However, the physical punishment was replaced by sarcasm&#8212;by talking children <place-holder colnum=\"12186\"/> down. In Scotland, that is one of the means whereby far too many children are disadvantaged.</p><p>We have to end bullying and violence, as ChildLine suggests&#8212;through, for example, the teaching of human rights and peace and tolerance. However, we have to allow children to express their views in their own languages and dialects. If children speak Scots, we should encourage that, because it will build their self-esteem. Such rights for children should be given greater importance. Amnesty International has suggested that the curriculum for excellence is a good place in which to enshrine both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They should be part of the teaching in every school.</p><p>When I was a modern studies teacher, I was happy to try to deal with some of these issues in relation to Africa. South African democracy was developing at the time when I was teaching.</p><p>Lord Foulkes made a point that we should stamp on immediately. I wonder whether he has mentioned Monsanto in the register of members' interests. The latest argument among the multinational seed and pesticide makers is that genetically modified seeds can feed the world. If free seeds were given out, if we ensured that there was transport, and if we ensured that the monopolies of these companies did not send Indian farmers to their deaths through suicide because their crops had failed, we could do much more for families and children in many parts of the world. I suggest that Lord Foulkes withdraw his ridiculous remarks.</p><p>The most important things that children can learn about their rights can be learned at school. Children can learn to respect the rights of others, and that will happen as their understanding grows.</p><p>Of course,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Aa thae roses an geans will turn tae blume\",</p><p>as Hamish Henderson wrote in \"The Freedom Come Aa Ye\".

We have to give HBOS the space to rebuild. We have to allow liquidity for it to rebuild the real economy in the place where the Bank of Scotland was based for so many centuries and we have to secure the jobs in the bank to support the real economy. The wider economy will benefit from clear-headed thinking. This debate is not just about the immediate prospect of a merger but about learning lessons on the way in which banking has to be regulated. There has to be a European framework for that, and Scotland will have to have a direct say in that framework.</p><p>Members should support the motion.

Further, we must pay tribute to the people from the previous Administration who sought the proper means of achieving the creation of a tartans register. Of course, the election got in the way, but the current Scottish Government carried on the work.</p><p>Discussion on the bill included many of the different bodies who are involved in tartan. For example, the Scottish Tartans Authority, the Scottish Tartans World Register, the Lord Lyon and the Registers of Scotland brought harmony to the subject that made it worthwhile for the previous Administration and the current one to create a bill that we can all agree will have a positive and beneficial effect.</p><p>We must also thank the clerks of the committees, the civil servants who helped to find information and the bill drafters and so on who helped Jamie McGrigor get to this stage.

However, we owe thanks to the committee's previous members for allowing the bill to make the headway that it has.</p><p>I was interested in the debate on amendment 1. Further to the references to Harris and Lewis, I point out that, for the creation of Harris tweed, an act of Parliament in London ensures that the weaving of Harris tweed takes place in Harris and Lewis. Although amendment 1 does not stipulate that tartan must be woven in Scotland, the amendment attempts to encourage the industry to do that. Over the months that we have considered the bill, we have received evidence that quite a lot of tartan is woven in other countries. Indeed, after David Whitton cited the example of Mulbuie primary school, whose tartan ties had to be woven in the north of England, I was prompted to find out about that when&#8212;so that I could continue to wear it for another good number of years&#8212;I had to get my father's kilt repaired, turned round and washed <place-holder colnum=\"11748\"/> and so on. Many companies in the north of England are much better geared up to providing tartan because they have a more diverse output. We should note that, if we want the industry to be to the fore in Scotland, we need to ensure that the companies that produce authentic Scottish woven tartans are given every support to diversify to make that possible. We should encourage weaving in Scotland of the \"woven textile samples\" that are mentioned in the amendment. Although the word \"may\" was the means whereby amendment 1 was accepted, we all accept that that is a good principle to adopt.</p><p>With those few words, I fully support the bill and I thank all the people whom I mentioned earlier. In allowing the debate to commence, the bill is a step forward.

We could take forward a range of policies that are more important to us than they are to people further south.</p><p>In relation to animal welfare, we have heard from Labour about the pig industry. As the task force reported, the pig industry wanted two headage payments, but it was impossible to meet many of those kinds of demands. If we want a pig industry in the future, we will have to consider it in terms of our policy on the security of our food supply. We will have to ask whether the industry can be organised differently and whether the monopoly that seems to be developing is good for the industry in this country. We might even have to consider extensification and how we grow the feed for pigs. Issues of animal welfare, of biosecurity and of food security all tie in together.</p><p>Inevitably, remarks have been made about the import of cattle affected by bluetongue. If we have a strong policy of using native breeds that are suited to our conditions, there should be less and less need to import cattle. It is important to acknowledge that there are good commercial reasons why we have developed the use of European breeds of both cattle and sheep. However, when we consider food security and biosecurity, we have to wonder whether we can continue to allow the free market in beasts that are <place-holder colnum=\"11491\"/> alive. I think that we can find ways of doing things differently.</p><p>Consideration of the report and of our experience of foot-and-mouth disease, and consideration of the potential impact of bluetongue, led me to wonder about our ability to do testing here in Scotland. We have the technical ability, although we hope that it will never be required. However, the contingency plan for dealing with exotic diseases will have to be turned into a national plan, and we will have to be able to test here, so that things can be done more quickly.</p><p>Biobest, which is based at Edinburgh technopole&#8212;my colleague Alyn Smith MEP visited it recently&#8212;specialises in veterinary virology. Biobest offers herd care to farmers and has expertise in testing for numerous diseases. However, it finds it difficult to find approval to test when there are outbreaks and the Westminster Government steps in. That is an example of why we have to regionalise our policy and why we have to ensure that we have the capacity to undertake such testing here in Scotland. We need the full range of abilities in order to tackle any outbreaks. I hope that the cabinet secretary will take up that point in summing up.</p><p>I represent the Highlands and Islands, and our island issues will be mentioned by other members. They are a special case. Because we have to remove so many sheep in the autumn, there have to be plans for dealing with that in any year. We could have a summer during which very little feed is growing, so we have to be able to deal with that.</p><p>If we are going to have more local slaughtering, will we, like Austria, allow part-time abattoirs? In certain places, abattoirs would have to be part-time. If we are going to have them, can we work out a business plan to support a wider range of abattoirs? I would like to see that.

Nevertheless it is a cheap one, and perhaps we should ensure that visitors from London and other parts of the south, where VisitScotland has always had a strong advertising presence, should be offered the joys of camping in the midgie-ridden north. We will leave that suggestion for a little.</p><p>There are many other countries that are not quite so heavily affected by the credit crunch. We will undoubtedly have to look to persuade people from countries in the far east&#8212;such as Japan&#8212;or Russia to come to Scotland. Those markets are growing and we will have to target them. They may have airlines that could fly here directly, as we have fewer to offer now.</p><p>Decluttering the landscape has been a major part of the debate. The Government agreed that VisitScotland had to work more closely with the enterprise agencies but not that Historic Scotland should ensure that it plays an active role in marketing Scotland. The Government also agreed to<place-holder colnum=\"11058\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"review the myriad of publicly-funded initiatives such as Pride &amp; Passion, Hospitality Assured, Tourism Intelligence Scotland, Scot -Land of Food and Drink etc and declutter and streamline where necessary.\"</p><p>I will take what some members said about Historic Scotland a little further.

I come from an area with mixed farming and crofting, and it is obvious that the way in which decisions are taken and plans are made is not responsive to the area's needs. Under the heading \"Refocusing Institutional Structures\", paragraph 21 of the RSE report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a more locally-based approach is necessary. Public bodies that deliver policy seem to have become more rather than less centralised. This needs to change in <place-holder colnum=\"10949\"/> recognition of the diversity and variety in Scotland's Hills and Islands, with both decision making and delivery devolved as far as possible to regionally-based structures.\"</p><p>The upland communities of the Borders ought to have a focal point where decisions can be made about necessary support structures. The island councils are a good example of where more of that kind of support is provided. However, such support is lacking on the mainland, where many council structures&#8212;which ought to be part of economic development, and now are&#8212;are too large and cannot focus on rural areas. In Highland, large numbers of people live in Inverness. It might be a market for produce, but it also represents a centralised approach and a big drain on cash and thinking. We have to find ways of changing that.</p><p>The Crofters Commission claims to be working flat out, but regulations are not being applied. They will have to be applied in order to make crofting work again, and they will have to be decentralised to more local areas. I disagree with those who say that we should leave the Crofters Commission as it is: we need elected local bodies that will take a hands-on approach to making bureaucracy work for crofting communities. That will be a vital part of the shift towards more local decision making.</p><p>The RSE has opened up a whole new debate on refocusing the institutional approach, but we do not have time to consider that debate today.</p><p>Many members have mentioned rural development and halting the decline in population. It may be that the LFASS is a headage payment, but it is a headage payment not for cattle and sheep but for people in small farms and crofts. There must be support for the least favoured areas and the island areas. Some of those areas are very productive in terms of food, and many of them provide opportunities for viable human communities. The areas of the Highlands where crofting was first set up, and the communities where it exists today, are the only parts of the Highlands where there are still basic populations on which to build. We must be able to support them.</p><p>If we consider the LFASS in that spirit, we will have to consider the European debate and find allies in Europe who think in the same way. Our friends in Ireland do, and the French are far closer to the Scottish position than to the British position.

That sets a benchmark for how ferries will be dealt with in the future.</p><p>I will explain one key issue of geography. The idea of island hopping has been mentioned, which would mean less time on ferries for travellers. That can work only if there are roads that can carry traffic. An obvious point is that if people on Islay were presented with the idea of travelling in that way, they would look aghast, given the state of the roads in Jura. Nevertheless, we must think into the future about such proposals and see whether shorter ferry journeys can be integrated with the use of roads. In the Western Isles, people look to reach the nearest road. That means that people in South Uist use the Lochmaddy service to Uig, from where a road goes to Dover, if need be. That is the message that people have sent us. We must put the ferries in that perspective.</p><p>I hope that my colleague from the Western Isles will speak about RET, but I will not ignore the history of why we now need to try RET or the remarks about political favouritism. We should not forget that although the 40 per cent reduction in air fares was a good short-term fix, it did not help freight or tourism; it helped people in the Western Isles to spend money on the mainland and abroad.

We may have to revisit the issue in future if we give local government more powers.</p><p>I move on to two issues with which I am particularly involved in the Parliament and which are to do with the greener aspect as well as the wealthier and fairer one. I am delighted that we will have a climate change bill and a marine bill. The linkage between the two is important in the area in which I live. The First Minister, in describing the conflicts on the sea, said that the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"demands on Scotland's marine and coastal environment\"</p><p>affect</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the energy sector, shipping, fisheries, tourism and conservation.\"</p><p>We must find ways in which to accommodate each of those issues. I echo the points that have been made that the forthcoming climate change bill must be as effective as possible, but I believe that the Parliament will find a means to achieve that. In the committee system, we will reach a consensus and find practical ways to measure and make progress.</p><p>I will give a little example to show how we will resolve problems through the proposed marine bill. At present, in trying to give effect to the EU birds directive, the Government has asked Scottish Natural Heritage to consider extensions to some of the special protection areas. It is proposed that one such area in the Pentland Firth, covering Duncansby, Dunnet Head and Stroma, should include the coastal waters 2km offshore into the inner sound. The proposal has been criticised locally because of its potential to interfere with the development of tidal power schemes. The proposed marine bill has the capacity to deal with those conflicts. Indeed the Government will consider the extension of such special protection areas to make sure that the environment, birds&#8212;in the case of the Pentland Firth&#8212;and tidal power development can be accommodated. That is entirely possible given our geography.</p><p>As we become more capable in the Parliament and the country of being at ease with the environment and development&#8212;economic development is at the centre of the Government's programme&#8212;we see in the proposed climate change bill the ability to take a front-facing role on global action. We and our neighbours have a great opportunity to contribute to the wider European picture. I suggest to the chamber that through non-legislative measures, such as the extension of <place-holder colnum=\"10370\"/> renewable energy production in our country, we can contribute to meeting not only our own electricity needs but those of our neighbours in the south&#8212;England, Wales and Ireland&#8212;and in Europe.</p><p>The energy resources of the far north, which I represent, could deliver cheaper electricity for us in the long term if investment in renewables is seen as a national priority. Guess which Government values the energy potential of the Pentland Firth? It is certainly not the UK Government. A fortnight ago, it stamped down hard yet again on allowing favourable grid-connection charges so that electricity generated here can be sent to market. Someone has to tackle the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets; clearly, the British Government is not doing so.</p><p>Last year, Malcolm Wicks, the UK energy minister, and David Cairns, assured the Caithness renewables conference that they were right behind them in developing renewable energy. People have seen right through that. Significantly, Gordon Brown's Government warned off the Scottish Government from talking to Norway about a super grid. Surely that is an inhibitor of the development of clean energy in Scotland to enhance our opportunities to reduce climate change. It is a good, practical example of where Scotland needs to be in control, where we need to work with our neighbours and partners and why the Scottish Government has to be in charge of our energy development. That is possible through the Government's programme and I commend it to Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, thank you&#8212;not just now.

The long-term implications of the issues that the report raises, particularly for funding, are such that we must think out of the box. Perhaps we should think beyond the three-year period of the comprehensive spending review and try to secure cross-party agreement on how cash can be found in the long term. I suggest that an oil fund could help. I hope that members agree with me.</p><p>We must consider the combination of events such as coastal and pluvial flooding and high tides. Catchment-based flood management is difficult. The resilience to flooding of scattered communities in the Highlands is difficult to predict, given that a tenth of houses in the Highlands are liable to coastal flooding because they are situated less than 5m above high-tide level. How we plan is critical. We must acknowledge our geography and accept that people have a right to live in such communities and to expect the funding that will allow them to do so&#8212;although they will have to adapt. The terrible deaths in South Uist are a case in point.</p><p>The hydrological studies that are now taking place to work out what should be done should, perhaps, have been carried out before. There has <place-holder colnum=\"10221\"/> been some remediation, but there is a growing realisation in South Uist that the sea will not let up on the western machairs, and it might be necessary for hundreds of people to move. However, do people in Leith understand that that could be the case for them? The SEPA flood maps show that the major housing developments on the sea shore in Leith could also end up underwater. If we are not taking those issues into account in our planning, the report points to the ways in which we should.</p><p>I will give a little example that shows that co-ordination is missing, and why it is needed. One of the incidents in October two years ago affected the burn at Gartymore, just north of Port Gower. Margot MacGregor suddenly saw water flowing past her kitchen window&#8212;it was 20ft deep, rather than the burn that normally passes her house. That was frightening for her, and in future we will probably not allow people to build croft houses in such areas.</p><p>The culvert became blocked by branches, trees and bushes that were taken down by the flood, and the water flooded over the main A9, washing away about 50yd of the railway bed. It took an enormous effort to convince the police to close the A9, because of the huge diversions that were required. I was able to convince them that Network Rail should get a two-hour window four days later, on a Sunday afternoon, to begin the process of lifting the railway.</p><p>That incident highlights the lack of co-ordination, starting with the way in which we manage culverts and ensure that people do not dump bushes and trees into water courses. Landowners have to be more careful about keeping water courses clear. That example shows that people need to be much more geared up to do the routine maintenance that could cut out the problems.</p><p>In my own village of Evanton, more and more building has taken place up the hill in Chapel Road, Teandallon Place and Swordale Road, which has meant that the hard concrete and tarmac makes a natural course to carry the waters down. As we heard a parliamentary statement on the floods, we were looking at pictures of the floods at the bottom of the street. Preparation involving flooding equipment, deeper drains and so on will take vast investment, and in small villages such as Evanton there will be major disruption, as there would be in cities. However, the same houses are being flooded time after time. Such villages deserve to be saved from having to face that again.</p><p>It is interesting to note the comments that have been made about high resolution radar not being available. That is a matter for the Met Office, which we do not control, and it has also been a matter for the Ministry of Defence. It is now <place-holder colnum=\"10222\"/> necessary for us to have the debate with London, in the joint ministerial committees, to decide on funding. We should be looking to catch up, because we were left out in the past as being less important. We are equally important, and it is essential that we are able to catch up. The report's many excellent recommendations point us in the direction to enable us to do so. We need to have an overall body, and SEPA is that competent authority, but each local authority has to be tasked to do things.

It is entirely possible for us to grow it as part of the Scottish Government's policy of enabling our economy to do better. The ECOTEC survey showed exactly how it can grow, because of tartan's marketability. The register that Jamie McGrigor proposes should not be knocked, as it has the ability to raise tartan's profile and is the key to producing real growth.</p><p>It is suggested that people invented the short kilt&#8212;the f&#232;ileadh-beag&#8212;because it was easier for quarry workers and others to work in it. The f&#232;ileadh-m&#242;r, or large kilt&#8212;the belted plaid that Ted Brocklebank mentioned&#8212;is the garment that was banned by the orders issued after Culloden. People have a right to develop the kilt in many different forms&#8212;there are some rare sights at American Highland games&#8212;and the plaid can be worn in a modern sense. We should encourage the use of the plaid as well as the short kilts that many of us wear on special occasions.</p><p>In my view, including an official definition of tartan in the bill is a somewhat limited approach, because it is tied up with the idea that tartans must be woven. At the same time, when people are designing tartans, they will eventually want to make them out of cloth. The issue of whether they will have to produce a piece of cloth in order to register the tartan is fraught with difficulties. Of course, they must accept that Pantone colours and so on must be defined for designs. As was suggested, people must be careful, because a picture is not a tartan in itself. Looking at the tartans of different clans in books of tartans is different from seeing the woven tartans. We must find a way through all that. Perhaps we need to investigate how we can create tartan swatches more cheaply, so that people who want to innovate and create are not disadvantaged. I hope that, at a later stage in the bill, we can find out what can be done.</p><p>John Farquhar Munro mentioned copyright. We must try to work with Westminster on that, but it would be good if we could find a way of incorporating tartan copyrighting in the powers of the Scottish Parliament in order to bring that power together with the bill's powers. I say that because of the obvious way in which copyright affects Scottish things. New designs crop up all over the world. It is recorded in my register of interests that I am the president of the Kilt Society de France. People have registered tartans in <place-holder colnum=\"10047\"/> Scotland from there. They want to produce tartans and are not trying to compete with the Scottish industry in the way that Lidl tried, and such foreign producers must be encouraged, because their tartans also spread the story of Scotland.</p><p>I, too, was at the Royal Highland Show today and saw the Scottish Crofting Foundation's tartan. I said that I would give the foundation a mention in the debate. The tartan is a fine green and brown one, and it is excellent. I do not know whether I got there first with that, or whether Tavish Scott did. However, the SCF is a great example of a body producing its own tartan.

It will help our artists, practitioners and creative businesses to rise to new levels of aspiration, ambition and achievement\".</p><p>When I look at the bill before us, I see enabling legislation that can take us to new heights. I see not only the potential for advocacy and creative Scotland being the lead body but hard evidence that the agencies that will work with it will be happy to do so and are already working in partnership.</p><p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise said clearly that they were happy with the situation, and I am delighted that the minister has accepted all of the statements from the creative industries working group report and will create the creative industries forum, which will include all such agencies and answer the question about who takes which decisions. The route map that the forum will draw up will show how each agency works.</p><p>I have already seen local examples of people applying through the gateway. If people in my part of Scotland approached HIE, it would know where they should go. I am sure that, if we were fair, we would agree that that would happen in Scottish Enterprise areas too. That is why we should have confidence that the right framework has been put in place in the bill. The bill is not inadequate but will point the way clearly.</p><p>The comment that COSLA should be involved is relevant, although its involvement must be carefully managed. It is all very well saying that COSLA should have a place on the creative Scotland board, as COSLA first argued, but there would be a conflict of interest. Other committee members recognised that too. However, a special place for COSLA in the creative industries forum is important because it also has a part to play in the route map.</p><p>Considering how the single outcome agreements are being developed, I hope that the Government will make it clear how an audit trail can be built up to show how local authorities work. If some authorities have been deficient in <place-holder colnum=\"9864\"/> providing for culture, we should know who was in charge and what they were doing for the past eight years. Perhaps we can all work together now and ensure that we can do something to even up the efforts across the country.</p><p>It was interesting to see what happened on the question of the relevance of voluntary arts, as well as the professional sector, during our stage 1 discussion of the bill. The Scottish Arts Council, having started a flexible funding exercise in 2006, reached some conclusions about whether certain bodies should receive funding. It invited applicants to demonstrate how its work strove to be new and innovative. The danger is that creative Scotland will prefer innovation over the work that the voluntary sector does all the time to maintain people's access to the arts, which is not necessarily innovative but is continuous.</p><p>There must be some means by which creative Scotland can balance up the definition that it uses to ensure that it does not just favour innovation but allows for the work done by bedrock organisations such as Voluntary Arts Scotland and the Scots Language Resource Centre Association. Indeed, Scottish Language Dictionaries, which was mentioned by Malcolm Chisholm, was directly funded.</p><p>A debate is taking place about how creative Scotland will work. It will work in partnership and I believe that it will identify other sources of funding, as the minister said. Some language elements that have been funded through the Arts Council might not be funded through creative Scotland. We must ask whether creative Scotland will be able to measure the traditional arts in a fashion that is acceptable to us, but that is a debate for another day.</p><p>I welcome the bill.

Although 98 per cent of the population can receive broadband, about 30 per cent of the land area in remote areas is still not served. We need a map of that for telemedicine to work in the remotest areas, such as the islands and the north-west.</p><p>We must also consider the networks that the plan envisages. We need explicit mapping of those and a buy-in by the health boards, managers and clinicians who are involved. It is particularly important who the larger health boards explicitly recognise their responsibilities in that respect&#8212;it should be added to their list of key performance indicators&#8212;because they have such a wide variety of circumstances. We know from the debate that we had on the ambulance service that the situation in Wick is different from the situation in Kinlochbervie. We must make performance indicators that relate to service provision in the remotest areas part of what the health boards are expected to do.</p><p>Of course, underpinning the provision of health care in remote and rural areas is the ability of all staff to be able to do their jobs in those circumstances. That is why we must ensure that, at long last, the royal colleges and other training bodies for doctors, nurses and allied health <place-holder colnum=\"9358\"/> professionals are signed up to the training that is required. That will be a small but, nonetheless, enormously important part of their business. We have talked about the issue over the past 10 years of the Scottish Parliament, and the publication of this more comprehensive report indicates that the Government is now determined to bring those matters to bear. If we are to have a standing committee on how NRAC will work, we must engage fully with the royal colleges to ensure that they deliver for remote and rural areas.</p><p>I return to the issue of financial support. Part of the issue in the health service&#8212;and in every public service in remote and rural areas&#8212;is the need to have a rural poverty index or, as exists in Scandinavia, a form of equivalence that builds into the normal funding a recognition that our geography is as it is and that we must meet the needs of the people who live in it. It is not enough that urban areas are regarded as normal, rural areas are regarded as abnormal and remote areas are regarded as extremely abnormal&#8212;we cannot take that approach. RARARI did some good work in the previous session, although it was wound up, and is a good model for how we should deliver services in remote and rural areas. We also need the finance department to buy into the provision of all services in remote and rural areas.</p><p>Given the problems with the provision of care at Caladh Sona, Melness and the Assynt centre, both the health board and the social work department require to be funded in a way that allows the work that they do together to be done smoothly. Funding is tight, so it looks as though some projects will be lower priorities than others, and the psycho-geriatric hospital that will be built at Migdale for that part of Sutherland could take from both pots money that is available for the creation of resources in far-flung parts. We must ensure that we consider funding across all public services, including health. We should not think that we have to create an NRAC or an Arbuthnott formula every five or 10 years.

It is the best report that has been written about crofting that I have ever seen&#8212;and I have read them all. It is obvious that we have now found a good reason to say that crofting is an essential part of the future of the Highlands and Islands.</p><p>However, I take on board my colleague Roseanna Cunningham's remarks that many other parts of Scotland could benefit from the proposals. <place-holder colnum=\"8640\"/></p><p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise has examined figures from around Scotland to determine the balance between young people and older people, and has concluded that, if the economy in the Highlands and Islands were balanced, there would be 22,500 more young people between the ages of 16 and 29 in the region. The same can be said of many parts of Scotland, such as Galloway, Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. If crofting is one way in which people can be provided with a home and a means to sustain themselves, it might be a key to reversing that terrible trend. Of course young people want to go to the cities, but they also want to come back. However, they will not be able to come back unless they have a guaranteed home to come to.</p><p>In case anyone is confused by remarks that were printed in my name in Monday's <em>Scotsman</em>, I should say that I am delighted about the proposal to scrap the Crofters Commission. That is the first step towards the creation of a real local democracy that will involve people taking decisions at a local level in elected crofting boards.</p><p>In adult countries such as Norway, people constantly use local democratic structures to take decisions that affect their neighbours. I am delighted that we are at last moving in that direction. Indeed, if John Farquhar Munro were here, I would compliment him on his earlier proposal to set up an elected crofting commission, which I and the rest of the SNP supported. The proposal that we are discussing today goes even further in that direction, and puts in place elected power over planning in the crofting areas.</p><p>Part of that planning will be involved with ensuring the retention of inby land by stopping its erosion for house building. There are two important aspects to that work. First, it must dovetail in a way that ensures that planning in all of the crofting areas supports the retention of inby land. Too many local plans identify inby land for house building, which has got to stop. The elected crofting boards will have a strong voice in seeking to change planning law.</p><p>Secondly, the work must ensure the end of the reduction in the numbers of cattle and sheep in crofting areas. There was a 5 per cent drop in the number of breeding ewes last year and a 3 per cent drop in the number of breeding beef cattle. There is a world food shortage, but that breeding reduction is happening in places in which the job of providing food can be done best.</p><p>On the day that we are talking about the Shucksmith committee trying to find ways to increase agricultural production, it is worrying that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in London is suggesting an end to the European Union common agricultural policy, in order to import <place-holder colnum=\"8641\"/> much more cheap food from abroad. Trying to increase agricultural production while importing food cannot sit together. It is essential that we support home production, and crofting gives us the means to do that.</p><p>Creating township development committees to replace grazings committees would engage all residents in planning developments and would not impede innovation, as has happened so often in the grazings committees that I have dealt with for certain cases. Township development committees will have a liberating effect. However, as well as doing something about the grazings committees, we must ask what we will do about crofting landlords. The minister is one of the biggest ones. Not only that, he has a lot of land that should be in the hands of local people. We must find ways to encourage local people to take control of that land. If the Shucksmith process discusses the idea of elected local boards, I hope that some of that will rub off on the tenants of the public estates.</p><p>The role of the private landlord now comes into focus. My colleague Roseanna Cunningham mentioned the Kinlochewe judgment, which was correct in its day, because otherwise landlords would have had half the development interests on decrofted sites. The judgment provided a backstop for the Assynt crofters in those days, if they needed to file to take over their crofts. It was of its time and was a loophole in the law, but it can be changed now with the certainty that the new crofting law will enable people to stay on croft land in perpetuity while ensuring that they should be resident there to do so.</p><p>We must ensure that the agricultural support system for crofting provides flat-rate payments for particular areas&#8212;which the NFUS disagrees with&#8212;has a mountainous category and takes into account a remote island category as well. We should argue for pillars 1 and 2 to be modified so that they can adapt to such approaches.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13660123", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome this debate, bearing, as I do, many scars from debates on the subject in the Environment and Rural Development Committee, and because I am, as I state in my entry in the register of members' interests, a member of the Scottish Crofting Foundation.

It is obvious to me that ministers in the current Government have been to Europe and other places far more than were previous ministers. Indeed, we should deal with our engagement with the EU&#8212;Mike Russell led a ceilidh in Brussels just last week, for goodness' sake. Helen Eadie had better find out about such things in the answers to her questions. I should say that Mike Russell led that ceilidh after business.</p><p>When he came back from the United States of America, the First Minister stated that following such a successful visit at a modest cost, the next move would be to have a Scottish week in Russia. That is a great idea. Markets have been identified in China and India in the far east, but we are missing out on a huge nation that is becoming an important part of our lives, as part of Europe. The Nazis slaughtered 20 million people when they invaded Russia. As Dick Gaughan said, the Russians</p><p class=\"indent\">\"died fighting on our side\".</p><p>We have a lot in common with Russians. We stood alone with Russia during the war and Russia has felt enormously isolated in the world. Its birth as a capitalist country was harsh, and many of its younger leaders regret the impositions of the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, and the turbo-capitalism that was imposed on it. They want to forge links with the social democratic countries in western Europe that are their natural allies. Our international strategy can help to develop such links. We already have quite a lot of economic links with Russia; after all, London relies to a great extent on gas from the middle of Russia and beyond.</p><p>I have had the pleasure of meeting senior officials from the province of Yugra, which is three hours east of Moscow by air, beyond the Urals. Yugra is the richest oil province in Russia. Some 1.5 million well-off people there work in an industry that is powering the Russian economy. Those people are not just looking for economic links, although I hope that they will get them through Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise outlets, so that we can start to get that trade. Tens of thousands of Russians are coming to this country. I quote a document that was produced under the previous Administration just before the G8 summit, entitled \"Scotland's Links With Russia\", which says that 20,000 visitors from <place-holder colnum=\"8322\"/> Russia come to Scotland every year and that Russian tourists spend more than twice as much as tourists of any other G8 nationality. The potential for us to seek out such markets is something that our international strategy cannot afford to ignore.</p><p>The same document talks about \"Celebrating the Saltire\" in acknowledging our links with Russia. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Both Scotland and Russia have the same patron saint St Andrew. The saltire became a potent symbol of nationhood when Peter the Great, used it as the principal Russian order of knighthood. Fife born Samuel Greig served in the British Navy joining the Russian Navy in 1764. He was responsible for transforming the Russian Navy during the reign of Catherine the Great and today the saltire is the emblem of the Russian Navy.\"</p><p>Members should note that the saltire was a potent symbol of nationhood in 1764 and it is an even more potent symbol of nationhood now that the Scottish Government is independently minded and is going out to the world to deal with our friends, welcoming them as friends to a Scotland that aspires to be a normal country.</p><p>If people ask us about our national conversation and how the people see our future, I do not think that they want to talk about our doing nothing or being unambitious. The Liberal Democrat amendment is therefore completely misplaced, as it would not allow the free flow of ideas that comes naturally from a confident Government. I like to think that it is possible for our Government to be out there with its policies uninhibited by the silly and petty-minded approach of the Liberal Democrats, who today look even more last century than they did before.</p><p>In the European context, extending the European Union towards Kiev and Moscow would be good for us, and we can play a part in that. However, at the moment, we are also playing our part in the European Union by holding out the hand of friendship to Iceland&#8212;which was mentioned earlier&#8212;and Norway. Such countries have so much in common with us that our international strategy must embrace them. It is now possible for us to have a Government that tries to build those friendships by perhaps encouraging those countries to join the European Union. Our common interests in our natural resources&#8212;fish and energy&#8212;make it necessary for us to harness such friendships in north-western Europe, which has so much to contribute to the continent.</p><p>I am delighted that the new strategy looks out towards such things.

I hope that the idea of food security for this country can be translated on to a global scale, as our food security cannot be premised on insecurity for people across the globe. How we achieve that has to be part of the national food policy conversation. I will dwell on some of these issues in my speech, given that they fit into the subject matter of the Conservatives' motion. I agree that, at the outset, we are looking for action at the Scottish, British and European levels, but we have to go on to challenge the World Trade Organization. We have to ask about the right of people to have a fair deal for their produce rather than free trade in food.</p><p>If we are debating national food policy&#8212;as the minister said, there has been an enormous response to the paper&#8212;we must ask, as NFU Scotland did, \"What is on your plate?\" The answer to that, above all, will determine whether we are doing as much as possible to feed ourselves in this country, both in terms of quantity and quality. In that respect, I am glad that the Government is supporting more local food production and, in particular, the public procurement of more locally sourced food. That lead will encourage more people to grow more food locally and to have it bought in a secure market.</p><p>The Government has held a supermarket summit that allowed discussion with the large combines on the issue of local food sourcing. We saw an example of that in the Parliament last <place-holder colnum=\"8142\"/> week. Fundamentally, we have to tackle the issue of labelling and the way in which supermarkets display their goods. Although Scottish meat may be well labelled as such on supermarket shelves, it is laid out next to the Brazilian stuff. If people are poor and on a tight budget, they will always go for the cheaper product. That cannot be allowed to be the basis on which a Scottish food policy is built. Our engagement with the supermarkets has to include dealing with the issue of labelling. We have to have the statutory controls to ensure that labelling requirements enjoy the kind of backing that will make the supermarkets come to heel.</p><p>The NFU wants a European model of agriculture to continue after 2013. In the debate on the national food policy, we should define what that model will be. As I have hinted, the kind of food security that we want, with more local production, has to take account of the ways in which we produce our food. I will therefore have to focus on biofuels. We have heard the arguments on this displacement crop. As Oxfam has pointed out in its report \"Bio-fuelling Poverty\", once people lose their land to the biofuel producers, they lose their livelihood. As Oxfam says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Many end up in slums in search of work, others will fall into migratory labour patterns, while some will be forced to take jobs on the very plantations which displaced them and where labour standards can be horrific.\"</p><p>That is the downside of biofuels. Scotland's biofuel capacity from oil-seed rape could instead produce cattle cake; it could become a local source of animal feed and the like. We have to build that into the policy. I ask members to ensure that, when we come together, we base our efforts on</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Maintaining the diversity of the animals bred and plants grown.\"</p><p>The principle that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"For both historic and economic reasons we must preserve the biodiversity of the land\"</p><p>should be at the root of any food policy.

They underline the message that we are all responsible for our landscape, and that we ought to be able to understand it and have the backing of the statutory authorities to ensure that it is looked after.</p><p>Landscapes and townscapes vary greatly throughout the country. In the past 30 years alone, we have found out about 60 per cent more information about prehistory thanks to the Ordnance Survey's better methods. As a result, a vast backlog of interpretation has to be undertaken. Will the minister help us in that regard <place-holder colnum=\"7816\"/> by ensuring that the booklets that explain Scottish historic environment policy include one on interpretation? We have to examine how Historic Scotland and other bodies work together to bring out the stories in which particular buildings and monuments play a part.</p><p>There is little interpretation of sites that people do not pay to enter. As a result, the whole history can be missed. I am interested in the interpretation of such sites&#8212;it would be easy to do. I represent Orkney, where the world heritage site is an excellent example of co-ordination between Historic Scotland and the local authority.</p><p>Scattered throughout Scotland are properties and places associated with particular episodes in Scottish history, such as the Jacobites, the development of the Christian church, the wars of independence and the clearances. Historic Scotland and NTS have a responsibility to present to the public how a particular building or site relates to the development of our nation's story. Interpretation will follow and prosper if there is greater involvement between Historic Scotland, the local authorities and our communities.</p><p>We all agree that community planning should be much more involved with the historic landscape. Local people are often the best guardians of sites and information that could be better interpreted if they got backing. I look forward to the minister's response to that point.</p><p>I am delighted to note the extra money for the conservation area regeneration scheme. Perhaps it will be spent on some of the incomplete exercises of the past five years and on new exercises that have not yet begun. For example, a lot of work is going on in Wick. In conservation areas such as Argyle Square in Pulteneytown, for which Thomas Telford created the plans and in which people then built their houses, Historic Scotland imposes strong restrictions on what people's windows can look like. Although there is cash to support window replacement, Historic Scotland sometimes goes over the top in trying to recreate the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. The other half of Argyle Square has been altered by the addition of a glass panel in the area outside the church, and at the other end of the square a very unsightly shop takes up a corner site. If we are going to do the job properly, there must be investment in the whole of Argyle Square. Many of the residents would like to see proposals that are part of a wider plan from Historic Scotland, rather than receive rather curt treatment when seeking to replace their windows.</p><p>I am delighted that we have the support of HEACS in ensuring that every public body has a duty of care and that concordats&#8212;a useful word with an historical resonance&#8212;will be developed.

I represent the Highlands and Islands&#8212;a huge amount of Scotland's seas lies to the west, north and east of the region. The committee discussed what should be done in the long term to restore the eco-balance in the Minch. The prawn stock in the Minch is huge, precisely because biodiversity in the area has been destroyed. There used to be other species, such as cod and haddock, in profusion, but mismanagement of fisheries led to a situation in which one stock is the remaining source of income. The situation in the Minch illustrates the depth of the problems that we face when we consider Scotland's maritime environment's long-term sustainability.

I am delighted that the Community of Arran Seabed Trust project is approaching statutory underpinning as a result of the current consultation, as Kenny Gibson said. People on Arran want to protect the seabed. However, in other countries the application to the sea of planning structures that are designed for the land causes problems. People live on land; they do not live on the sea. In the Armorique regional natural park in Brittany in France there are signs in the harbours that say, \"No to a marine park\". Such problems arise because we need a different approach to management of the sea.</p><p>In some countries, such an approach might be pursued by a ministry that deals with the sea.

We thought that it was important that people should have the values and principles firmly embedded before we produced the draft outcomes and experiences, so that they were considered in the context of the values and principles.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 27 February 2008; c 655.]</p><p>Those are wise words. The problem is that although that is a good theory, teachers' daily business is to ensure that they prepare students and pupils to achieve current requirements.</p><p>Hugh O'Donnell called for more CPD for teachers and that is important. However, so is the way in which it is focused&#8212;training must be more than just seminars from HMIE. There should be much more time in school for different departments to debate how they will handle the changes.</p><p>I offer a further quote to back up my concerns, this time from Brian Cooklin of the Headteachers Association of Scotland. When talking about whether teaching methods would have to change under the new curriculum, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is a credibility gap between the talk about high-sounding principles and what happens on the ground. For us, the issue is bridging that gap.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee</em>, 5 March 2008; c 739.]<place-holder colnum=\"7073\"/></p><p>Cross-curricular and interdisciplinary work is a rich vein to explore and teachers are coming up with many extremely innovative ideas. They realise that their subject could contribute one aspect, another subject could contribute another and the various aspects could be integrated. That is a major challenge for teachers who are used to working within subjects and it will not be met satisfactorily in just a year or two.</p><p>The Government has inherited the task of developing a curriculum for excellence and making it practical. We all have to take a reality check and accept that we need to audit how schools on the ground are getting on with the values and principles before we change the exam system. We must be very careful about that.</p><p>Let us consider an issue that shows the obvious need for a cross-curricular approach. It has been announced that Scottish history will become a compulsory part of history exams at the top level. Ensuring that a broad sweep can be taught will require a lot of work. As was mentioned, we have debated the matter before, and that highlighted the problem of getting a wider grasp of a subject and enabling teachers, especially those who are not history teachers, to deliver that approach. I ask that we find ways to provide the material to allow the necessary debate to take place in schools soon.</p><p>I have talked to teachers in large and small schools in my region and it is clear that they want the security of knowing that the values and principles are in place before major changes in assessment come along.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400900", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted that we are debating the curriculum for excellence, to which the Government is fully committed.

I watched the process from the sidelines during the first parliamentary session and I was involved in debates about boundary changes in the second session, so I am glad that we will have a review that takes account of how we trust local people to make decisions. In that respect, I agree totally with RSPB Scotland that the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"parks must focus more attention on delivering against the first objective, including biodiversity protection and enhancement.\"</p><p>That must include the biodiversity of the human population in the parks, too. It is best for decisions to be made by the people who live in the area.</p><p>The thinking behind how the park boards were established was that people who live in the area needed to have board members appointed nationally in order for the job to be done. Like John Scott and, I think, the Liberals, I suggest that we have reached the stage at which a national park board can be directly elected locally and can consult the experts who require to back up decisions. In relation to Neil Kay's report, the strategic review could make the case for a directly-elected park board with absolutely no appointees. That would be a good democratic way forward that would recognise, as local people do, that local people's future is at stake.</p><p>When he read the Kay report, my fellow nationalist David Fallows, who is the councillor for the Badenoch and Strathspey ward, said that he was worried. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we fought long and hard for a clear and strong element of local democracy within the Park. We accepted that the Park was a National asset&#8212;but at the same time emphasised that the Park was our Park&#8212;the land where we live and work and where we have staked our hopes for our futures and those of our generations to follow.\"</p><p>That statement expresses the view that people are growing in confidence about taking on the job of <place-holder colnum=\"6987\"/> running the national parks on the nation's behalf, with the support of bodies such as SNH. I commend that view to ministers.</p><p>Other aspects of rationalisation could save money. If a board were smaller, more money would be available to spend up front on the work that the national parks must do. That would be a strong argument in tight financial times.</p><p>Quite a bit of debate has been had about the planning functions. I agree with the argument of various groups, including Ramblers Scotland and the RSPB, that planning functions in the Cairngorms should be firmed up. It is possible to see that happening, but agreement is needed about what we expect from planning in the Cairngorms and in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. We want a much firmer approach to sustainable economic development in the housing that is built there. As tourism is the parks' primary source of income and employment, people who provide services to tourism need to be able to live inside the parks rather than have to travel into them for work. That issue is fundamental because of property prices.</p><p>I agree with the Cairngorms National Park Authority that it is essential that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The demand for housing must also be managed to ensure high environmental and sustainability standards.\"</p><p>If the national parks are centres of excellence, the planning functions ought to ensure much higher standards for housing in the parks than apply outside the parks. Such housing should be very eco-friendly.</p><p>Should the housing fair that has been set up in the green wedge at Inverness have taken place in the Cairngorms national park? Should we not save that green wedge and set an example for the housing that should be built? Such housing is not necessarily more expensive, but it is of far better quality for the future. That is the way in which the national parks could look after the human population's biodiversity. I hope that the review will consider that.</p><p>I join other members in thanking the minister for his comments on the extension of the Cairngorms national park, but national parks are not likely to stay static. New ones will be created, if people wish that to happen and the process is followed. The boundary changes in north Perthshire are welcome, given that that was the overwhelming view taken in the previous Parliament. I am sorry that some of the members who spoke in favour of the boundary change today did not vote for it in the previous Parliament, or we would have had it.</p><p>Let us finish on a high note&#8212;there were people who saw things correctly. I hope that in future we can point to new areas that can become centres of <place-holder colnum=\"6988\"/> excellence and enable national parks to do a cutting-edge job that people look up to, not only in terms of what John Muir wanted, but by the standards that we have to meet today for Scotland to set an example to the rest of the world and lead the fight against climate change.</p>", "hdate": "2008-03-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13400736", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parks"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to talk about the next phase in the development of the national parks.

That is the sort of research that can give us a much clearer picture of where we should be planting. I urged the previous Executive to think about the matter, and I am sure that the SNP Government will treat it as a priority now.</p><p>We should give some thought to the kinds of species that we are growing. No one has yet mentioned that, if we are going to have a lot more wooden buildings, we should be growing more Douglas firs here. We need to do that commercially, to supply the main beams and structures that will last 300 years&#8212;rather than the 30 years' life of public-private partnership schools, houses and other buildings that are being built at the moment. We need to plan for the long term. If we start growing Douglas fir in our own country, rather than importing it, we have the opportunity to create many more jobs here. I believe that Sitka <place-holder colnum=\"5952\"/> spruce can be used for cladding. We have got a lot of it, and such uses would be better than using it for the gash purposes that some fast-growing woods have previously been used for. We should recognise the huge new market in the kinds of timber that will be used for eco-friendly homes.</p><p>I have asked about the possibility of a forestry map, and about resident workers. It is interesting to take note of the Balcas factory, which I hope will soon be built at Invergordon. It is based on a structure used at Enniskillen in Ireland. The company there serves a whole market across Ireland by transporting the pellets that are created. If we can ensure that such a body gets going here, it will allow people to use wood-fuelled stoves, which cut the amount of carbon that is emitted and which increase the amount of heat in the home. That could be of great benefit.</p><p>I know that the minister is concerned that, when we tie up parts of the sector in producing the wood for making pellets and for wood burning in biomass form, we must have a secure market. Therefore, we must ensure that the machinery works. The plant that uses waste heat from the distillery in Wick is an example of something that must be able to work. There are plenty of good examples on the continent, as has been mentioned, which could help to ensure that we get the sort of equipment that can do the job. What an opportunity that is, considering the news that the waste plant in Lerwick is bringing hot water to 700 people&#8212;although it is burning waste, rather than wood, unfortunately. The thing that bothers me about the Lockerbie plant is that there is nothing there to use the waste heat. That is a mistake that cannot be repeated.</p><p>On the matter of having a joined-up rural agency, there has not yet been any mention of how the Forestry Commission is to work with other agencies. I hope that the minister can tell us a little more about how farmers, communities and others can buy into the whole sector. We know that the use of forests, in their many forms, can increase the number of people involved. We should ensure that the Administration enhances the potential to bring new people into forestry.</p><p>The rural development programme will be tight, and we will seek to make additions to it in the near future. The forestry sector offers one of the brightest hopes for us to create more sustainable jobs in Scotland. I fully support the motion, but I hope that we can sort out and agree on the amendments in such a way that they do not negate one another. The basic principle is that we need a sustainable forestry.

The event took place in Fort William from 29 November to 1 December last year. It was an exciting event in the year of Highland culture, and it took place at the start of the winter festival that highlighted Scotland's wonderful traditional music in all its forms. It created a high-profile opportunity to bring the music and the music industry into the spotlight of media and public attention.</p><p>The event's organiser, Simon Thoumire, and his team deserve the highest praise for their year-round efforts to support Scotland's thriving musical culture, which encompasses Gaelic song, folk music, Scottish dance music, pipe bands, and a host of other forms. The awards give recognition to excellence in all those forms. Hands Up for Trad also encourages musical celebrations for St Andrew's day and is a co-supporter of the BBC Radio Scotland young traditional musician of the year award, which is held at the Celtic Connections festival each January.</p><p>There has been debate about what is most important&#8212;the awards themselves, sponsored by industry supporters, or the gathering of like-minded folkies to celebrate the development of the genre each year. Whether or not one votes for the winners in the Scots trad music awards, the event <place-holder colnum=\"5912\"/> provides a much-needed chance to celebrate our indigenous music, its players and its promoters. That is confirmed by the camaraderie at such events. People of all ages in the traditional music field support each other's work. That is a tribute to the communitarian nature of Scotland as a nation. It has underpinned our national sense of self, has bolstered the development of our Parliament and has rightly been dubbed the democratic muse.</p><p>After five years of the awards, I would like to know how that thriving scene can be developed with the help of the Scottish Government, public agencies and the market that should open up here and in other lands. I say that in the full knowledge that, for years, Scottish musicians have been invited to and have toured in many countries. There is an urgent need for our television broadcasters to showcase this truly Scottish product at home and overseas, which is even more important in the European year of intercultural dialogue 2008. To date, there are no official events planned to explore that in Scotland. One of the year's aims is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to highlight the contribution of different cultures to the member states' heritage and way of life\".</p><p>That is important.</p><p>Why have the broadcasters not televised this enjoyable, professionally presented event, the Hands Up for Trad Scots trad music awards? BBC Radio Scotland provides excellent coverage, but it is the TV audience that should be targeted to share the stunning live performances at the trad awards. One act that performed at last year's awards poses a key question&#8212;how can a wider audience hear about our unofficial 17-piece national folk orchestra, the Unusual Suspects, led by Corrina Hewat? They are truly international stars and played a major part in the success of the Scottish showcase at the huge Lorient festival in Brittany last August. Where was the TV coverage?</p><p>In Fort William, Julie Fowlis won Gaelic singer of the year and album of the year awards for her recent CD, \"Cuilidh\". She has subsequently added to those awards the BBC Radio 2 folk singer of the year award for 2008. With her multi-instrumental talents and contemporary take on the songs of North Uist, she is self-effacing but surely the coolest of today's Gaelic singers. She gained widespread TV time in May, on \"Later with Jools Holland\", due to the call-off of another artist, and in the BBC 2 documentary \"Bliadhna Julie\"&#8212;\"Julie's Year\". However, regular viewers may have missed those programmes.</p><p>Another trad music award winner in December was Phil Cunningham, who won the award for composer of the year. Meanwhile, he has been stopped in the streets and at airports, and received e-mailed congratulations for his six-part <place-holder colnum=\"5913\"/> BBC series \"Scotland's Music\", which was produced in Aberdeen on a low budget and which gave the huge range of our music major exposure on BBC 2 Scotland. Why was it not broadcast across the United Kingdom?</p><p>The cases of Julie Fowlis and Phil Cunningham go to show how much more regular TV coverage would engage an audience that is ready for more live contemporary music. We know from the BBC that the Saturday night edition of Phil Cunningham's show in November and December was attracting 250,000 viewers against \"X Factor\" and \"Strictly Come Dancing\", but no plans were made to publish a book of the series or to produce a DVD, which would have sold around the world for Christmas presents. The hot topic of conversation at the festival club after the Scots trad awards was the demand that future awards ceremonies should be televised, starting with the sixth awards, which are due to be held in the Old Fruitmarket in Glasgow in 2008. Surely this is a matter of urgency for the BBC, and a burning question for the Scottish Broadcasting Commission about how the BBC serves Scottish audiences and sells Scottish broadcasting products around the world.</p><p>Looking to our European neighbours, I have met cultural attach&#233;s and representatives of European Union member states and Regleg Governments to discuss how they promote their traditional music. There is a huge welcome for Scottish culture there. Other countries, such as Norway, Denmark, Flanders and Catalonia, produce annual CDs to showcase potential markets for their top artists. Surely the Scottish Arts Council should be doing that for Scotland. The promotion of Scottish music in England and in many other lands could be a rich source of income for our sparkling musicians. Can the minister suggest how the Scottish Government could aid that process? If we make more bilateral contacts, we could also ensure that more musicians from other countries come to Scotland.</p><p>The motion is a kind of review of traditional music in the past year. We should have an annual debate to celebrate it; if we can have one about fish, why can we not have one on traditional music? After such an outstanding year as 2007, I can only agree with the singer, Karine Polwart, who wrote in the <em>Sunday Herald</em> on 16 December:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is a good time to be a folk musician. There's a lot of cross-fertilisation across genres, and a different approach to music. Lots of people making their names just now have very specific local identities, like Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen.</p><p class=\"indent\">There's that whole sense of being from somewhere and speaking in your own voice.\"</p><p>The success of the Scots trad music awards highlights why support and encouragement for the democratic muse deserves to be stepped up.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13397967", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scots Trad Music Awards"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to be debating the fifth annual celebration of Scotland's rich musical traditions, the Scots trad music awards, or&#8212;in my somewhat hesitant Gaelic&#8212;Comharrachadh Duaisean Dual-che\u00f2l na h-Alba 2007.

Our amendment proposes a funding system that will enable us to ensure that that creativity is present and to save some of the money that would otherwise be spent. Unfortunately, we have inherited certain commitments. As any responsible Government would do, we have said that we will meet those commitments. However, we must think carefully about the delivery of the next tranche of schools, because they have to be better designed and more pupil friendly.

Controlling demand for electricity and saving energy go hand in hand. The context is the climate change consultation and the bill that we will deal with. The whole issue of energy must be considered in addressing the imperative to deal with climate change. The development of a Scottish energy strategy is central to the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"5147\"/> Government's approach to meeting our climate change targets, which should be more ambitious. That will be fleshed out this year.</p><p>Maintaining early momentum towards creating clean energy is a key part of that approach. If that is to be achieved, development of the current renewables industries that use onshore technologies must continue, and offshore technologies must also be developed. I am glad to note that WWF is right on message with the Scottish Government in recognising those principles.</p><p>We used to ask the previous Administration about energy saving. If we consider how much money is invested in a nuclear power station&#8212;let us say a couple of billion pounds&#8212;what bang do we get for our buck if we spend the same amount on energy-saving measures? That is the sort of question that we must consider now, and I hope that we can start to quantify the answer in this year of the climate change consultation.</p><p>Clean energy development is an essential partner to that. We have got a competitive edge, and a base from which to work, which will allow Scotland to ensure that the advantages that we have started to gain are fully realised. Why throw that away by relying on an energy strategy from London that deals with security of supply in terms of what happens in Kazakhstan or elsewhere? The security of supply that we can provide&#8212;infinitely&#8212;comes from the waters and the air, and the waves and the tides around our own shores. They are so close to us; only someone who is totally myopic could not see that. That is the difference between the Government's strategy and the Opposition's, particularly Labour members and their Tory friends, who are skirting round the central issue.</p><p>I will concentrate on one particular potential&#8212;the Pentland potential. Liam McArthur spoke about the Orkney input into the development of marine renewables. We need an all-Scotland focus on the Caithness and Orkney area. We have academic input from the environmental research institute in Caithness; we have the industrial base from subcontractors and from Dounreay's technology; we have test sites and the excellent work of the European Marine Energy Centre; and we have Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which should be working as an infrastructure developer, although questions arise about how much it is doing that and how the Government can ensure that it takes a more strategic role.</p><p>In considering the renewables potential in Orkney and Caithness, which will feature in a conference in Edinburgh on 6 February, we must consider energy for home consumption and for export. We have the potential to fulfil our power needs and to make money from a clean and green source of power. However, we must ensure that <place-holder colnum=\"5148\"/> we are not inhibited by bodies such as the Crown Estate, which, according to the most recent press releases, is thinking about an interconnector that goes only to Norfolk. Such inhibitors to development must be removed.</p><p>The Crown Estate has an arbitrary approach to taking money from harbours. It is a superfluous body, and it is a tax-gatherer on the seas for the Treasury that gives nothing concrete back to Scotland. That inhibitor must be removed. For example, Scrabster harbour, which is the nearest mainland base to the west Shetland basin and which could be an oil base for the future, pays &#163;36,000-plus a year to the Crown Estate. The harbour trust has stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is no apparent benefit to the trust nor the local community from these payments as we are not aware of any reinvestment in our area by the Crown Estate\".</p><p>We must remove the Crown Estate, which is a development inhibitor that stems from London. For example, when the Forestry Commission set up a Scottish body, the Crown Estate pulled out of Scotland&#8212;it is a London-based tax gatherer on the seas.</p><p>A second inhibitor is the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, with its scandal of charging 30 times what is charged in Denmark to hook up to transmission lines. Figures gathered by HIE at the time of the previous Caithness conference on energy show that that approach inhibits the potential of our secure and clean renewables. That inhibitor must be changed and removed, but I see nothing in the Energy Bill in London that will do that.</p><p>A third inhibitor is the nuclear legacy. Taxpayers' money was used to build the nuclear power stations of the past and that investment continues&#8212;every year, &#163;157 million is spent on decommissioning Dounreay. If public and private partners invested the same amount in renewable energy development, we would begin to see the kind of moneys that are required to develop the potential of green power here. However, that has not yet been realised because, under devolution, London takes most of the powers and lets us have a small number. We need a Scottish energy strategy that targets money to ensure that the aspirations in the national planning framework are met. We need to channel cash resources from the Scottish Government and private partners.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395878", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The energy debate centres on the production of electricity and the conservation of energy, which must be central to how we tackle the challenges that we face.

We can see that things have moved on and I congratulate Liam McArthur on securing the debate.</p><p>It is clear that the air ambulance situation in Orkney is totally unacceptable and unsatisfactory. The Scottish Ambulance Service's provision of air ambulances has to be reviewed urgently and the cases in Orkney are the prime reason why that should happen, although cases from elsewhere add to our concerns. Under the previous management of the SAS, we got less than the <place-holder colnum=\"4357\"/> truth. I believe that it is now possible for the SAS to see things more clearly.</p><p>I echo Liam McArthur's view that the cross-party meeting in Inverness dealing with matters relating to the Highlands demonstrated a new openness and recognition of the problems by the SAS. The service is a small part of the national health service and it is not easy for it to make its voice heard. However, I point out that, Highlands NHS Board had to spend an extra &#163;20 million on trying to cope with the agenda for change. It might have been far better if we had a funding structure that was organised for Scottish needs and allowed some of that &#163;20 million to be spent on air ambulance provision.</p><p>Increasingly, the air ambulance is seen as a way of dealing with the issues of the islands and remote Highland communities, which means that air ambulances will be used more often in the future. If that is the case, we must ensure that the kind of helicopters that are being used and the practice of relying on Loganair aircraft for backup are reviewed. The helicopters that are being used at the moment can take two patients, which means that there is a restriction on folk travelling with patients, which is terrible for someone who needs to be accompanied, such as the person in the situation that Liam McArthur described.</p><p>In relation to that example, and others that we could give, it is important that we ask for a review that would allow for the backup that has been talked about. It is not good enough for us to rely on a helicopter that is flown by someone who has some local knowledge, because all helicopters are subject to the same restrictions on when they can fly. It is essential that fixed-wing aircraft be available. The alternative is the old-fashioned option: that would mean a lifeboat, which is unacceptable in this day and age.</p><p>I echo the cross-party outrage about how people in the Orkney islands have been treated.

I will draw some comparisons. Environment and health, recreation and commerce, all go together and they work well.</p><p>We have to plant a lot more fruit trees, hazel trees and the like, which people can grow both in small spaces and more widely. We have to change our diet, and one way of doing that is by planting trees such as those that I mentioned. If people use wood in wood-fired stoves, it heats them four times&#8212;once when they fell it, once <place-holder colnum=\"4323\"/> when they split it, once when they stack it, and once when they burn it. Planting trees is useful for both health and the environment, as it keeps a carbon sink in place.</p><p>The value of green spaces to the physical environment is important in the debate, which should not be diverted into discussion of SPPs of whatever sort. In the Inverness area, the green wedge is being used for a sustainable housing fair. However, on the outskirts of the city, large areas in private ownership are being used for massive housing developments whose quality will be nowhere near that of the housing that is being proposed in the fair. Why do we have to use the green wedge? We have to get our hands on more of that other land, on which people are speculating.</p><p>Community woods and mixed woods work well. A good example is the small 36 hectare wood at Culag in Lochinver, which contains Douglas fir, Norway spruce, Sitka spruce and Scots pine as well as pockets of other native trees. The local schoolchildren use the woods. They plant trees themselves, so they are learning to do what the Liberal Democrats' stream-of-consciousness amendment proposes. I am sure that the minister and many other people have been planting the seeds of ideas that are helping people to do such things. It is important to do so.</p><p>Those who are involved at Culag woods have also helped with people's health by buying another area at Little Assynt, where they have built accessible paths for wheelchairs. I was pleased to be at the opening a couple of years ago. The project shows that we can take people out into the countryside or go on our holidays to an area and find facilities for the disabled. That enhances people's lives. The area has been planted with thousands of native trees, so it will become even more interesting in the future. One can see golden eagles and many other sorts of wildlife there.</p><p>The most massive green spaces are the world heritage sites. I make a plea for the Government's support in ensuring that the flow country in Caithness becomes such a site. We have to apply through Britain and so on. We have got to move on, in that sense, and make sure that we get the world importance of such places recognised.</p><p>The community planning partnerships are a way to get local communities to think about how to develop woodlands and open spaces. We have to do much more to give them a chance to do that. However, a great stress inducer is the way in which the Big Lottery Fund is making it more and more difficult for community groups to buy woodlands and the like. It changes the rules for applications all the time. In my village, Evanton, we have been struggling for the past five years to buy a wood from a willing seller in the local estate. <place-holder colnum=\"4324\"/></p><p>We have to tackle that as well.</p><p>As I said to the minister, aye be sticking in a tree&#8212;perhaps a Christmas tree in a big pot that can be brought out each year instead of chopping one down.

To continue one of Patrick Harvie's themes, I can envisage many more parts of the country being able to play their part in increasing growth without it having undue effect on the environment if we can grow the potential of each family to have an income that is &#163;10,000 higher by the end of the strategy period. That is an incredible piece of logic, which gives everyone a part in this work, and the Government goes on to suggest how we can do it.</p><p>I will consider some issues in the north of Scotland that help us to see what is being done now and what could be done under the strategy. We are talking about gross value added in Ross-shire, Sutherland and Caithness of about &#163;500 million per year. It is interesting that that is affected by matters such as the cost of decommissioning at Dounreay, which&#8212;as is revealed in the newspapers today&#8212;has gone up by &#163;500 million in total.</p><p>However, the huge economic potential of oil to the west of Shetland and renewable energy in the Pentland Firth has not necessarily been considered. If we are to exploit that potential, elements in the Government's economic strategy must come into play. It is important to stress the size of the potential. According to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, nearly a fifth of Britain's known oil reserves are around the Faroes and to the west of Shetland. The nearest port in the north of Scotland is Scrabster, but there has been no rush by the enterprise bodies to get going and back up development in Scrabster. The Government must stress to people in the north that one of the reasons for being able to cut the development budget is that there will be no more duplication, whereby people in Caithness speak to people in Inverness before making decisions. There are many examples of money being wasted, but the new, streamlined approach will take care of that.</p><p>As I said when I intervened during Iain Gray's speech, we are suffering under a London system that puts us at a grave disadvantage in the development of marine energy and other forms of clean power. Before the election, the First Minister talked about the potential for a supergrid across the North Sea, which would link Scotland and Norway and serve northern Europe. We should keep such proposals in mind, because when I complain to Ofgem about the scandal of charges for getting on to the grid that are about 36 times what people in Denmark pay, Ofgem just says, \"That's not the problem; it's about getting planning permission.\" There have been no planning permission issues. Marine renewables are the big prize.<place-holder colnum=\"3596\"/></p><p>Tavish Scott has left the chamber, but I was interested in his comments about the size of the HIE budget. If he wants to increase the budget, what will he cut? He was the Minister for Transport for the central belt. He used to fly over the Highlands on his way to Shetland and he never saw what it was like on the ground. The SNP Government's infrastructure and transport policies will include the rest of Scotland. Of course everything cannot happen in three years, but a queue can be formed and areas will not be excluded as they were during the previous, coalition Government, when transport in the north was out in the cold and nothing north of Stirling or towards Aberdeen was developed. Links will be put in place.

All those aspects have been brought together to create a national food policy. It is worth reflecting on how people can feed into such a plan.</p><p>On procurement, Highland Council has been considering how it can maximise the use of local food and include a reasonable proportion of organic and fair trade food in schools, hospitals and the local prison. When the local school meals group met, it discussed the problem with rules, which a number of members have mentioned. The Scottish Executive interprets the EU rules. It is important that they are made perfectly clear. I was interested in what Mike Rumbles said about our focus on fresh produce. We need to find a way to deliver. The rules have to be crystal clear so that everyone can take part.</p><p>Seasonality is important, too. Small producers have to be able to work up to the possibility of taking over the production of food for schools locally. The local school meals group <place-holder colnum=\"3102\"/> acknowledged that, given that samples have to be provided, it would be a good idea to have pilot schemes involving 20 or 30 schools in each council area that does not already have a good system in place. The availability of food all year round will require greater capacity. Therefore, we have to encourage more people to be involved in the production of food for local consumption.</p><p>When the tenders came in, it was found that although Highland Council, to its shame, employed Brake Bros&#8212;before the councillors had a full handle on things in the summer&#8212;the local produce on offer was only about 10 per cent more expensive. That could have been accepted within the budget limits, but the big killer in rural areas such as the Highlands is the cost of distributing food to schools. The wholesale costs of distribution are outrageous. We have to find a way for food producers to share those costs between them and try to find a cheaper way so that all schools in the area can be served. Many of the products cannot be grown at some of the smaller schools in the west.</p><p>I am a member of the Scottish Crofting Foundation&#8212;that might be relevant to what I am about to say. It was shown in the planting to plate exercise during the summer that, when we teach children how to plant or rear food and then cook it, we get the best of both worlds. We want schools to be involved. Inverness high school has its own garden. It sells the produce in local farmers markets and it also serves up the produce in the canteen. That example shows that it is possible for schools to grow their own food.</p><p>The Highland people were keen to involve East Ayrshire Council, which sources 60 to 70 per cent of food locally&#8212;we will probably hear more about that&#8212;compared with 13 per cent in the Highlands. There are practical issues in changing from using bulk suppliers to employing local suppliers. We must do that in stages by increasing the number of schools that are involved in pilots. I recommend that approach to ministers.</p><p>I was pleased to read the report of the open space event, which mentions my point on education. The top priority of the nine issues on which participants voted was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"How can we engage consumers in relation to food and health?\"</p><p>Personal and social education in schools was regarded as the main way to do that. If we are to have a system in schools that benefits the whole nation, we will need appropriate materials and national guidance on how schools should deliver the message. It is important that education ministers are involved. In the past, ministers have said that they cannot interfere in what schools teach, but it is time for us to set guidelines. <place-holder colnum=\"3103\"/></p><p>Inspectors would then consider at a later date whether standards were being met.</p><p>We must not forget the role of the Food Standards Agency. It is interesting that, at a time when we are talking about major reports that show that organic food is good, the FSA is agnostic on the matter. That does no service to Scotland, and it has to change. Worse than that, however, the FSA is also silent on genetically modified ingredients in food. It is assumed that, under the surface, quietly, it is in favour of GM ingredients in animal feed. We must get the Food Standards Agency sorted out.</p><p>As we move forward, we need a definition. The idea of food security can be developed into food sovereignty. That concept does not display an exclusivist attitude against food from outside, but goes to the heart of our health and our personal, physical and economic well-being. It is in our interests that Scotland continues to produce top-quality food and that we get a chance to eat it. The type of food that we want can be summed up in three words&#8212;good, clean and fair. We need to get producers and consumers on board, and we can do that by having a national food policy that uses that definition.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13391060", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate covers health, education, agriculture, environment and transport.

Where are those who are accusing us of breaking promises coming from? What did they celebrate at their British conference in Bournemouth? Let us think about that. Gordon Brown is the friend of the super-rich. He always talks about social justice, but is always reinforcing notions of Britishness, which have been the bane of our lives. He has presided over a tax system that imposes higher marginal rates on working and middle-class taxpayers than on the wealthy, and that penalises all taxpayers who had the bad luck to be born in Britain rather than abroad. He has made Britain a tax haven for the rich, which is one of the things that is stopping Scotland making progress. Considering where Labour is coming from is important when we are thinking about whether we can believe anything that it says. Labour is barefaced in its attempts to sook up to the hedge-fund kings, to excuse Northern Rock and to seek loans from those people to keep its election campaigns on the road. The tax breaks for wealthy foreigners who are behind that are the ruin of an economy that we could build on. That is what is holding us back.</p><p>It is important to take those things into account.

Other members mentioned the maintenance of culverts. A number of bodies are responsible for that, including the roads authority, Scottish Water and local authorities. It is often the failure to clean out rivers further upstream that creates situations such as one that I saw on \"Gardeners' World\", in which two 40ft tree trunks were carried by a stream in Shropshire and ended up in a couple's garden. They were trying to rebuild something that had taken them 40 years to create. Those tree trunks were the responsibility of landowners further upstream. Householders are responsible for their properties, but landowners, including the owners of croft land, are also responsible for their property, for flooding and for insurance. They have to be brought into the picture.</p><p>In another example, communications to the north of Scotland were cut at Portgower near Helmsdale. A stream that comes down from the crofting communities clogged up the culverts.

Unlike Mike Rumbles, I think that it is essential that Parliament deal with the way in which the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 is working, and that the motion is an excellent means by which to do so.</p><p>Sarah Boyack talked about the symbolism of the act and how it has made it possible for people to access land. We must continually refine words into certainties. Like devolution, the legislation in question is not an event; it is a process. That process will be tested in the courts, but it will also have to be reviewed in Parliament.</p><p>Coming, as I do, from outside Perthshire, it strikes me that there are interesting aspects of the access code. All managers should manage land and water responsibly for access, so a section of the access code describes how they should do so. However, I wonder whether, as we develop the legislation, we should test how many landowners have made it possible for people to access parts of their land in an acceptable fashion from the point of view of the general public and from that of protecting people's right to privacy. If we are to extend the debate, I would like to see how things work. I say that because the Scottish Crofting Foundation has been circulating a letter to its members that states:<place-holder colnum=\"1664\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, local and National Park authorities are obliged to produce, by February 2008, plans for a 'system of paths sufficient for the purpose of giving the public reasonable access throughout their area'.\"</p><p>The letter goes on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is very important that crofters and grazings committees that might be affected by the designation of Core Paths are involved at an early stage of the consultation procedure.\"</p><p>It seems to me that we are talking about the rights of landholders as well as rights of access, and that there must be a means to balance those rights. Open crofting land is not the same as a wood at Kinfauns, but access circumstances might affect a crofter as much as they affect Ann Gloag. I like to think that the law could take account of such things and that application of the law would be sensitive to small landholders in particular.</p><p>It is clear from the way in which the courts are working that proprietors who wish to make land available for development under other parts of the land reform legislation are now happy to send Queen's counsel to the Scottish Land Court and to outbid people who might object to that. So, the argument that there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor comes into play with regard to other aspects of land transfer at the moment. That matter must be seriously addressed. Parliament may have to consider whether it is equitable for someone to have to tackle a QC who is paid so much and who could land them with huge costs.</p><p>Part 3 of the 2003 act, which concerns the right to buy, has been shown to be considerably flawed from the point of view of communities outside as well as inside the crofting areas, as Roseanna Cunningham mentioned. The question of interposed leases was understood before the land reform laws were passed, but was not adequately dealt with during that period. As I said at the beginning, symbols are all very well, but it will take several slices of work by Parliament to turn symbols into certainties. If the Justice Committee has the space and the time to review the matter, that will be helpful. However, I am also looking for the minister to say how the Government will take on board what the previous Administration said about there being a need for post-legislative scrutiny of the land reform legislation and what the Government is going to do about it.</p><p>It is not a case of focusing just on the Gloag-style access grab, which is what I would summarise the motion as being about. The issue is not the need to save the land reform legislation; it is about developing it in a fashion that will satisfy more people than are satisfied at present. Because of the inequity of the problem of people trying to appeal issues such as this, whether they are organisations or individuals like ourselves&#8212;I <place-holder colnum=\"1665\"/> have about a third of an acre of curtilage&#8212;we are looking to the Government for help in sorting out the problems. I hope that the minister can help us. In developing the land reform legislation, we may be able to learn from the Kinfauns case.

It has been long anticipated&#8212;too long for people of my generation&#8212;and welcoming it is a delight. We have been presented with a series of bills and non-legislative priorities that allow each part of the country to benefit from the Government's lead.<place-holder colnum=\"1400\"/></p><p>The wealthier and fairer objective leads me to mention why the abolition of bridge tolls is linked with the road equivalent tariff. Bridge tolls were dealt with under the principle of equity. Equity must take into account Scotland's geography and allow us to travel freely from all parts of the country to participate fully in our economy and in national life.</p><p>How can the more than 100,000 people in our 89 inhabited islands fully participate in such things unless some form of road equivalent tariff is introduced? The day after John Swinney made his announcement about the pilot in Stornoway, I was on a small Orkney ferry. The 600yd from Wyre to Rousay that the ferry crosses is about the most expensive 600yd in the world to cross. Such issues are now being addressed. We are talking about not simply a 40 per cent discount on air fares, but about allowing people, including businesspeople, to travel back and forward in every part of our country. Exactly the same argument applies to bridge tolls. We must have a far better and fairer way of measuring road use. I expect those issues to be debated during the consultation on climate change targets, which we in the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee will deal with next year. The wealthier and fairer proposals hold together in an important programme for the whole country.</p><p>I ask the Government to try to step up work on another non-legislative priority. It may want to retrieve the powers of the Crown Estate Commission. That would be widely supported. The most prominent issue relating to the Crown Estate in Scotland will be its approach to managing Scotland's sea bed and foreshore. There are big issues for us in that respect, including renewable energy issues. Addressing the issue within the existing legal set-up would be possible, and an immediate benefit could be had for our harbours. Some 80 per cent of Scotland's harbours are managed by the Scottish Government, local authorities and trust ports in the public interest. We could change the way in which the Crown Estate takes revenue and give a major bonus to operations that are at the heart of our coastal trade. I think that such action would receive cross-party support.</p><p>I turn briefly to the proposed culture (Scotland) bill and the creative Scotland body. There has been a lot of talk about education and culture for eight years, but at last, by picking up the threads of what has been discussed during that period, we can allay the artistic community's fears about interference in artistic policy. The new minister with responsibility for the arts recognises that, through creative Scotland, the arts will be able to call on funds that support excellence wherever it occurs in Scotland. Separating the national companies will mean that their needs can be dealt <place-holder colnum=\"1401\"/> with separately. When I thought about having a wealthier Scotland, I was heartened by a possibility. Individual donors could give much more to support major companies in the same way that donors gave money to refurbish Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. The big companies ought to look for more such donations while creative Scotland supports arts throughout the country. I saw that issue in the programme and look forward to its being dealt with.</p>", "hdate": "2007-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13386665", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a great pleasure to welcome the Scottish Government's programme.

We are, however, talking about the need to reconcile 85 acts of Parliament in the UK legislature, which will take time.</p><p>I welcome this opportunity for us to make a united statement that we want progress to be made. Nothing will happen all of a sudden during the recess that could put us off course. I believe that the minister's efforts show that, with the determination that the Scottish Government now has, we will ensure that regulation is put in place to allow us to intervene and prevent the oil transfers from happening.</p><p>There are many good reasons why we need local democratic accountability&#8212;indeed, accountability in Scotland&#8212;over such matters. Local accountability is an obvious difference between what is planned in the Forth and what happens in Orkney, where there is a locally accountable harbour authority. I say to John Scott that part of the problem we face is the privatisation that took place in the 1980s, which has caused much of the difficulty today. We could have taken <place-holder colnum=\"1311\"/> in hand the question of democratically accountable harbour authorities much more easily.</p><p>The joint ministerial committees will help the ministers to talk about these things. I hope that the ministers down south now realise how important such communication is. Given their irresponsibility in not applying the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 in this case, I hope that our ministers will ask them why they took so long to address the matter.</p><p>The Scottish Government is taking more powers&#8212;that is welcome. By making these minor amendments to the details of part IV of the 1994 regulations and broadening their scope to cover all plans and projects, the amending regulations will plug gaps in the current legislation, transposing article 6 of the EU habitats directive in Scotland. However, as Sarah Boyack mentioned, we must also think about the utilities that can operate outwith the regulations governing strategic environmental assessment, and so on. We need to review that. Forth Ports and Scottish Power are the kind of bodies that must be brought into the scope of the regulations.</p><p>In Scotland, we have gone further than they did down south on matters of strategic environmental assessment, but I think that we need to go further again. It is important to recognise that we are all involved in a learning process. Iain Gray, who is sitting beside Sarah Boyack, told election audiences before he was re-elected that he thought that it was really a matter for the UK to deal with and not a matter for the Scottish Parliament at all.

It is hoped that the expertise of the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney and the huge power of the Pentland Firth will provide the base for a full-scale trial to be run within two years.</p><p>The successful development of the project will be aided by our new marine renewable obligation certificates to ensure that a successful road to commercialisation will help the Scottish operation to have global technology rights, with future units manufactured here and exported to other countries, which will ensure that the benefits stay in Scotland and Norway.</p><p>I welcome today's news of another development in the suite of marine renewable energy developments. AWS Ocean Energy&#8212;which is based in Alness in the region that I represent&#8212;has announced that it has built a demonstration version of its Archimedes wave swing, which is being installed by EMEC in Orkney in the next year or so.</p><p>Such developments highlight the need to maintain confidence in the renewables sector so that onshore and offshore wind, wave and tidal power will benefit. The Scottish National Party supports the deployment of onshore and offshore renewable energy technologies, with the valuable addition of the proven Norwegian tidal machinery.</p><p>In order to distribute the clean power that will be generated around Scotland, Norway and, possibly, Iceland, we will need a new supergrid. My colleague, Alyn Smith MEP, is working on such a collaboration from the perspective of the European Parliament. Our small, innovative nations along the northern arc of prosperity need markets for our secure, clean power. That is why I look forward to the Scottish Government building on the early <place-holder colnum=\"857\"/> talks that were established by Alex Salmond, before he became First Minister, with the Norwegian Government and the European Commission on ways of taking forward proposals for an electricity interconnector linking renewable generation off Scottish and Norwegian shores with energy-hungry markets in mainland Europe.</p><p>It is our ambition that Scotland and Norway, in partnership, can take the lead in tidal power technologies and undersea transmission, just as Denmark was able to become, in the past decade, the lead nation in the area of onshore wind power.</p><p>The promotion of Scotland's tourism industry is a key priority for the SNP in government. Within the enterprise structure, the reformed VisitScotland will treat Scottish tourism as the major industry and employer that it is and as a key driver for economic development. I hope that the rebranding will soon announce a \"welcome to Scotland\" logo and deliver a far stronger marketing strategy that decentralises tourism information and services. That must lead to an increase in the promotion of a number of access points to Scotland that are further afield than the two central belt airports that seem to be VisitScotland's focus. That is why I believe that the prospects for creating a direct sea route for freight and passengers, to link our two nations, should be pursued with vigour.</p><p>What better way to illustrate our contacts and commerce with our old friends across the North Sea than to celebrate the planned arrival at Scrabster of the new north Atlantic ferry, the 36,000 tonne Norrona, on the evening of 18 June. That sailing will inaugurate the Faroese Smyril line's weekly summer sailing that will link the Scottish mainland, Shetland, the Faroes, Iceland, Denmark and Norway. Well done, Scrabster harbour, for preparing to dock such a large vessel. I agree with the Scrabster Harbour Trust that Scotland Transerve, our roads authority in the north, must be ordered to fix as soon as possible the landslip problem that narrows to one lane the A9 trunk road access to Scrabster harbour, which has traffic lights that have been there since last October's storms. I am sure that the new Government will take heed of the difficulties that have been caused by that problem, which became apparent in 2004.</p><p>What better way to show the increasing potential of the northern European market than to see the 164m vessel, which carries about 1,500 passengers and 600 cars, getting full use? Let us remind Scots that the Scandinavian high pressure zone offers far more reliable summer weather than we experience here, and in return let us induce Scandinavian visitors to sample Scotland's produce, scenery, cities, cultures and so on by taking a trip here.<place-holder colnum=\"858\"/></p><p>I am glad to make this speech in the presence of the consul general of Norway, &#216;ystein Hovdkinn. I am delighted that we can fruitfully explore the prospects of Scotland and Norway as commercial partners, and we have much to gain from that friendly collaboration.

The network has a service level agreement with Highland Council under its waste strategy to operate a kerbside collection service for recyclates. However, because of the time that it has taken the council and the civil servants to work out the funding for the area plan, the network has encountered enormous problems and much of its effort has been taken up with trying to fit in with the situation.</p><p>That situation is why we need to audit area waste plans and find out whether they work.

It offers a service to 3,000 of the 4,000 households in the area&#8212;90 per cent of which have taken it up and 75 per cent of which present a kerbside box for collection once every three weeks&#8212;and collects a wide range of items, including paper, card, food and drinks cans, plastic bottles, textiles, glass bottles and jars, bicycles and lawnmowers, which it then sells on. The Government must ensure that there are markets for many more items than are currently collected&#8212;and, indeed, that are collected only in certain parts of the country. For example, we have to find markets for materials such as plastic, and ensure that mixed plastics are not simply shipped out to China. Such a move would allow us to take forward the process that I have been discussing.</p><p>If we are to take advantage of the opportunity that Scotland has to become a green energy capital, we must ensure that social enterprises, local authorities and the many other bodies that are involved view waste as an enterprise issue rather than just an add-on.

That is our inheritance from the coalition Government that preceded the present Government and it is the issue that we must address today.</p><p>I should declare an interest as a member of the Scottish Crofting Foundation. As I alluded to earlier, we must consider carefully the way in which the LFASS works. A large amount of money is associated with the scheme, which will be reviewed in the period up to 2010. It is essential that the least favoured areas that I mentioned, such as the islands and the remote Highlands, which have a huge potential for production, for generating environmental benefit and for nature-friendly farming, are considered in and benefit from the review. I hope that the cabinet secretary, when he consults the farming and crofting communities, will find ways in which he can take those areas into account. It is essential to understand that the agriculture funds that are at our disposal include convergence funds from Europe, from which the least favoured areas in the Highlands and Islands can benefit. If possible, I would like to hear that the ministers will consider how the convergence funds can help agricultural production. That is an area in which we could make a big difference to the future of crofters and farmers in our least favoured areas.</p><p>The single farm payment system, which was, I presume, created so that we can eventually move away from having any subsidy for farming by the middle of the next decade, is already biting in relation to the production of cattle and, in particular, sheep. In areas such as Sutherland, <place-holder colnum=\"266\"/> where there are a large number of excellent sheep producers, fewer and fewer sheep are being produced under the system. That is a whole group of farmers who are losing out, and we have heard about problems for other groups, such as the dairy farmers. In the arguments about the rural development programme, we must ensure that the programme works for every part of the country&#8212;the First Minister said that the Government will take into account all parts of the country&#8212;and that we introduce means to support sheep farming in those areas.</p><p>We have not had much discussion of forestry. The national forest land scheme, which the previous Administration introduced and which we supported, must deliver woodland and forest crofts. We need more people to live in the countryside. As there is a demand for land in the countryside, we must free up that land. I hope that the Government will be able to do that under the rural development programme. The LEADER programme is a bit bureaucratic, but it involves local groups deciding on the best projects. The programme can help to free up land and so create a bigger market for farmers by having more people living locally.</p><p>I thank the ministers for creating a situation in which, at last, we can have a debate in Parliament on the issues before we go to Europe, although it is unfortunate that it is taking place only a day or so before.

It can go further and can create the possibility of including highland Perthshire in the national park.</p><p>When it was announced that Mr Swinney's proposal was not going to have the support of all the members of the committee, <em>The Press and Journal</em> quoted Mr Swinney as saying that it was \"utterly not the case\" that his bill would need more legislation, apart from a possible technical measure for election arrangements. We understand that if a member tries to deal with a matter of this sort, they are unable to introduce the secondary legislation that would normally be required for a bill. However, lodging a bill, as Mr Swinney has done, is often the only way in which members can make progress on certain issues. Therefore, dumping the bill in the underhand way by which that will be done today&#8212;with the people <place-holder colnum=\"33411\"/> who are going to vote it down not even coming to the chamber to listen to the arguments&#8212;is one of the nastiest parts of this little exercise.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the benefit of the topography of the Cairngorms and the Mounth is being thrown up in the air and out of the window in any consideration of how to deal with this issue. In Scottish terms&#8212;indeed, perhaps even in European terms&#8212;the Cairngorms national park's present boundaries are large. However, the bill would add only a small area to the park.</p><p>To speakers who have asked why John Swinney did not argue for the inclusion of other areas of land, I would point out that he is arguing for the inclusion of an area that he represents. The other parts that members mentioned have only a handful of residents, if any. In any case, I am sure that the MSPs who represent those areas would be arguing for their inclusion in the park if there were any demand for that.</p><p>The SNP supports John Swinney's approach because we think that it would be complementary to include highland Perthshire in the land management deliberations relating to the park, the core path network and the development of the park authority and that the sooner highland Perthshire is in, the better. However, we are faced with a Government that is not big enough to say that it made a bad decision at the time but that it will now change its decision and go along with the proposal. After all, the Government could take over the bill and progress it. In that regard, I say to Donald Gorrie that I am thankful that we have a Parliament in which we can start a bill in one session and carry it on in the next one. That is a big improvement on Westminster.</p><p>The issue that concerns me most is the fact that we are overlooking why a national park is a national park.

In the programme for the 2006 awards, he says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The aim of these Awards is to highlight Scotland's wonderful traditional music in all its forms and to create a high profile opportunity which will bring the music and music industry into the spotlight of media and public attention.</p><p>The Awards, which give recognition to excellence within Scotland's thriving music culture, encompass all aspects of <place-holder colnum=\"33192\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">traditional music, from Gaelic Song, folk, Scottish dance music to pipe bands and a host of others in between.\"</p><p>The Nevis Centre in Fort William provided a tremendous venue for the awards last December. The weekend is to be repeated this year, the Scottish year of Highland culture.</p><p>Many groups are teaching our native music around Scotland. Some examples are the Scots music group of the adult learning project in Edinburgh, the Gordon Gaitherin, and the national centre of excellence in traditional music at Plockton high school, but no formal teaching organisation is as powerful and influential as the f&#232;isean movement. That was confirmed in a recent book by Kate Martin, who is now lecturing in community education at the University of Dundee. She was a founder of F&#232;is Rois. She has edited a history of the first 25 years of the f&#232;isean movement that was launched at the Hands Up for Trad weekend last December. She sums up thus:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It seems that in return for a relatively small investment, in the Highlands and Islands and beyond, the F&#232;isean are producing a generation of assertive and skilled young people who are confident in their culture and as a result can relate to other cultures. They are creating networks, enhancing the quality of life, building social capital and community capacity, and contributing to employment in rural communities.</p><p class=\"indent\">When young people become aware of and confident about their own culture, it becomes possible for them to appreciate other cultures, and contribute to a wider social participation and understanding.\"</p><p>That is precisely the message that the Commission for Racial Equality uses to underpin a confident multicultural society. Indeed, the City of Edinburgh Council underpins its increased support for Gaelic in the city's life on that basis. That dovetails with the idea of cultural entitlements that in turn underpins the youth music initiative that has proved to be a substantial injection into the experience of primary 5 and 6 pupils in the past three years.</p><p>Will the minister's evaluation of the initiative ensure greater future investment? Will there be more instruments? Will one year's experience of live music mean just that&#8212;and not just an hour-long lesson for 12 weeks of that year? That ambition would extend the confidence and scope of the scheme. I hope that it will be possible for every one of those children to experience some live traditional music and musicians in their classrooms as well as many other musical forms.</p><p>In the foreword to the f&#232;isean book, the then minister, Peter Peacock said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I would also like to commend these bodies that have supported F&#232;isean nan G&#224;idheal over the years. They should be pleased with the results of their investment in the organisation. This is indeed a success story.\"<place-holder colnum=\"33193\"/></p><p>We have to build on the backing that Highlands and Islands Enterprise has given to the strengthening of communities that underpins its backing for the f&#232;isean, and extend that to the Scottish Enterprise area for the rest of Scotland. Will the minister comment on that proposal?</p><p>BBC Scotland's promotion, Scotland's music 2007, celebrates and showcases many strands of music making on the radio, but we need to lobby hard for BBC television to show off our talent. Will there be many more hours of music on television this year? Thousands of people voted in the Hands Up for Trad awards. Surely we agree that the BBC should cover that event on television, ensuring a worldwide audience. Can the Government seek to get a pledge from BBC Scotland to do just that?</p><p>Many journalists, such as Ruth Wishart in <em>The Herald </em>of 21 February this year, have commented on the link between a newly self-confident Scotland and the resurgence of Scottish traditional music as exemplified by the annual Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow. It has developed an international audience and global artistic content. The most striking factor in the resurgence is the relative youth of many leading participants. There is no doubt that the f&#232;isean movement is largely responsible for that. That is why the Scotland Funds has F&#232;isean nan G&#224;idheal as one of its early project partners.</p><p>The Scotland Funds events across Canada later this year will feature the best of young musicians from Scotland.

Indeed, 67 leases reported nil production for the period 2004-06.</p><p>The Crown Estate does not seem to have the mechanisms to ensure that sites, once leased, are actually used. Because many of the sites are owned by large organisations, such as Pan Fish, which has a huge range of locations and leases, amendment 14 would not be a form of overregulation or micromanagement.

I cannot fail to note that such companies keep applying for more sites. In the debate about the Clyde fishery, the planning application that has been mentioned most recently is the one from Marine Harvest for a site off South Corriegills in Arran, which has the potential to interfere with an agreement between the Community of Arran Seabed Trust and the Clyde Fishermen's Association to create a scallop seeding area there.</p><p>If large firms such as Marine Harvest are not using all their sites&#8212;and there is lots of evidence that they have plenty to choose from&#8212;controlling whether they could get more sites would not be micromanagement by the Executive; it would be proper management. Given the ministerial commitment to a statutory underpinning for the historic agreement between Clyde Fishermen's Association and COAST, it is surely obvious that the Executive should augment the approved code of practice with amendment 14, which would limit the length of time that a fish farm operator could have a site if it was not in use.</p><p>I move amendment 14.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13380515", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 7 &#8212; Code of practice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "During stage 2, I raised the question of the way in which the approved code of conduct would act in terms of fish farms.

We have plenty of organic beef, lamb, table birds and aquaculture produce, but horticulture, arable farming, eggs and dairy production could contribute a lot more to the organic market. We have to find ways of bringing more producers in those areas into the scheme. We could agree on such a target and I hope that the Government will set its cap at it to show that it is committed to ensuring that people can buy organic produce across the board.</p><p>Perhaps the answer is to have a target of 20 per cent growth ever year&#8212;that would be slightly less than the growth rate between 2005 and 2006, as the Soil Association has pointed out. Such a growth rate would lead to about 1,800 organic farmers instead of the 1,200 that there are at the moment, and it would represent about 8.75 per cent of farmers and around 12.4 per cent of Scotland's agricultural area.</p><p>Wales's organic action plan aims to increase organically managed land to 15 per cent, from 10 per cent, by 2010. If Wales can do 15 per cent, there is no reason why we cannot. The arguments about organic food being a niche market do not stand up. We must recognise that people can meet those kinds of targets.</p><p>I would like to reassure members, particularly Mr McGrigor, about tighter EU regulations. Yesterday, the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted a report recommending tighter proposals for labelling organic food. The report recommended that the regulations should be extended to the whole catering sector, including takeaways, canteens and restaurants, and that products such as wool, food wrapping, essential oils and food supplements should be included. That committee hopes that the European Parliament will accept its recommendations and I hope that members of the parties opposite me in this chamber will not water down the recommendations when they are debated in the plenary session of the European Parliament. The key aim of that report is to preserve consumer confidence.</p><p>Stricter standards for the use of plant health and veterinary products and stronger guarantees against contamination by genetically modified organisms are among the priorities of MEPs. When we talk about GMOs, we are talking about the dangers of having a sectorised agriculture policy. In this country, we have not dealt with separation distances between conventional and organic produce and between those and <place-holder colnum=\"32572\"/> genetically modified produce. The consultation about that is critical. The future of organic produce and the saleability of conventional produce relies on our being able to prove that there is a low contamination rate. I agree with Jamie McGrigor that the Government has a challenge to meet in relation to achieving as low an infiltration of GM into food as possible. That is what the consumer wants.</p><p>More than 700 Scottish consumers answered the Food Standards Agency survey. We should be aware that healthy eating is their biggest concern, that they are concerned about fat, sugar and salt in food, and that most people want food labelling using a red, yellow and green system. As someone said downstairs, we could use brown to show that something is organic and perhaps purple if there is far too much GM in it. I am sure that people could understand a traffic-light system in labelling healthy food and that organic food should be towards the green end.</p><p>More and more people are eating out, so Scottish consumers are also concerned about being able to identify how fast-food outlets, restaurants and cafes maintain hygiene and the quality of their products. Our debate is about organic farming, and that can fit into restaurants' attempts to have the best quality and meet consumer needs.</p><p>Several members have mentioned competition for the small amount of cash that is available in the rural development programme. The rural stewardship scheme and the organic aid scheme should not be in competition; we must find means to support both. I hope that the minister will take on board the fact that, to achieve more for organics, the ministers with responsibility for health, agriculture and transport must all work together to ensure that people around the country who produce organic food can sell it to a growing market.</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13380172", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Organic Farming"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The experience of taking part in this debate, which is pitched in terms of increases and improvements   in organic food, is positive and I want to add some more positive items and make it possible for us to see the way forward a little more clearly.

It is a complex weave, and I want to reflect some of it in the few minutes that I have.</p><p>I agree with Phil Gallie that it is essential for fishermen to take part in initiatives such as the SSMEI, the Clyde pilot and the Firth of Clyde forum. The natural wealth of the Clyde is something from which humans should benefit, and it is important that fishermen are involved in all the discussions.</p><p>However, the questions have to be asked: Why were herring and cod there in the past and why do the predatory species no longer exist there? Why are there so many prawns? There are so many prawns because there are fewer haddock and cod. Some means of rebalancing the situation will be required for real biodiversity to be regained. Fishermen have also noticed that some prawns are beginning to be diseased. If that continues, what will happen after the prawns have gone? The Clyde Fishermen's Association has questions to answer in that regard.</p><p>In Arran, the Community of Arran Seabed Trust&#8212;COAST&#8212;has been working to protect and preserve Lamlash bay for more than 10 years. The majority of its members live on Arran and represent 20 per cent of the island's population. On its proposal for a no-take zone, COAST has widely consulted local fishermen, academics, politicians, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Executive, but it has taken more than 10 years to get the Clyde Fishermen's Association on board. Thanks to the fact that the Parliament's Environment and Rural Development Committee took evidence on COAST's petition, both groups were finally able to come together to make an historic agreement. Clyde Fishermen's Association has agreed to some kind of statutory underpinning to a no-take zone in return for a seeding bed for scallops just outside Lamlash bay. The agreement will be of great benefit to the fishermen but it also recognises the need for no-take zones. I am sorry to say, however, that the talks are at such an early stage, we are told, that it is not yet clear what kind of statutory underpinning the zone will have.</p><p>However, there is a fly in the ointment: Marine Harvest wants to put a fish farm where the proposed scallop recovery beds are to be sited. That must certainly be tackled because getting the fishermen and the local community to co-operate has provided a wonderful prospect for the future. We must try to build on that example on a wider scale.</p><p>I suggest that we should take with a pinch of salt the claims that the Clyde Fishermen's Association has been \"ahead of the game\". The CFA is certainly in the game and, from the perspective of <place-holder colnum=\"32498\"/> the Scottish National Party and from the point of view of all the users of the Clyde, we certainly hope that the association will play a full part in what happens in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13380033", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Clyde Fishermen"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Phil Gallie on gaining the chance for us to discuss how far ahead of the game in conservation the Clyde Fishermen's Association really is.

Under the model that the UK Government has put together, with the Scottish Executive's agreement, the decommissioning of Dounreay will be paid for by a programme that is quite simply flawed. For example, it relies partly on money from reprocessing at Sellafield. It is ridiculous to suggest that we can use the proceeds from producing waste to clean up other waste and, indeed, such a proposal jeopardises the proper decommissioning work at Dounreay. If the 500 jobs at Dounreay are lost&#8212;I stress that I am not scaremongering, because I do not think that that will happen&#8212;it will be a major blow not only to that economy but to a workforce that, after carrying out a smooth decommissioning, could use its skills to harness new energy sources.</p><p>That clean-up, which is at the very heart of the nuclear equation, could cost a heck of a lot more money.

It was interesting to hear that Scottish Enterprise will conduct an economic impact assessment of the tartan and textiles industry.</p><p>The debate also flows around the idea of cultural impact. How do we assess the cultural impact of tartan? It is one of the most positive items that we have in Scotland, and many speakers have reflected on the fact that the overall view of tartan is that it is instantly recognisable and something that we ought to cherish.</p><p>The vexed questions are how we deal with copyright, authenticity and other issues. There are various ways of doing that, but I am not sure that to create another quango would be good. We must be careful about how we consider registers and their cost. The minister must think carefully about <place-holder colnum=\"31832\"/> how to apply the economic impact assessment so that it leads to a means of liberating rather than constraining the trade. I agree with Jeremy Purvis on that.</p><p>To illustrate my speech, I am wearing a tie of the Breton national tartan, which is registered in Crieff. It uses the black and white of the Breton flag, or gwenn ha du; the blue of the sea, armor; and the green of the land, argoat. It respects the Scottish tradition but represents people in a different country. Already, tartan is an international product.</p><p>Last week, I read about the creation of a Polish tartan, which is mainly red and white like the country's flag. The person who bought it, a baker of Polish origin who lives in Edinburgh, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I'm Polish, but I am living in Scotland now... I want to be seen as a Scottish person. A Polish tartan seems like a good idea.\"</p><p>I hope that we could reflect here the respect that is given to tartan internationally.</p><p>I hold the unpaid position of honorary president of the Kilt Society de France. It is one of those odds things that crops up after attending a Celtic tartan day event, not in America but in Paris. This year's is in Normandy. The point is that many people around the world want to reflect the type of dress that has become known as Scottish. In doing so, they honour the tradition of tartan and spread the good word.</p><p>As I said at the beginning, many tartans&#8212;the Breton tartans, the Normandy tartan and so on&#8212;are registered at Crieff. That provides a fix in the world at present. However, it is essential that we ensure that the next generation knows that it can go to one source.</p><p>It is perhaps an overstatement to say that tartan is unregulated, because people have sought to establish authenticity. However, authenticity means something entirely different now when people can invent a Parliament tartan privately&#8212;to exploit the creation of Parliament&#8212;a Polish tartan, a Breton national tartan and so on. We must think very carefully about how we will achieve our aim.</p><p>Naturally, the Scottish National Party wants positive images of Scotland to be cared for and looked after in a fashion that takes them forward. Jamie McGrigor began to explore the issue well, but the question of a register will have to be part of the minister's thinking beyond any economic impact assessment of the tartan industry, because the issue is about much more than the economy&#8212;it is about our cultural impact. I hope that the minister is prepared to take on board that assessment. He might be in the wrong department to do that, but I hope that Scottish Enterprise will acknowledge that it needs to take much more cognisance of the communities and culture of our country and to recognise that the issue has a <place-holder colnum=\"31833\"/> scope that goes wider than the pound in people's pockets.</p><p>The Scottish National Party welcomes the debate and acknowledges that good will exists throughout Parliament to ensure that tartan flourishes. The tartan that I am holding up is for the year of Highland culture 2007, and was designed by children in Mulbuie primary school in Ross-shire. It is called the golden broom tartan and was part of an enterprise in education project for primary 6 and 7 pupils. I welcome that. Those pupils' terrific efforts are being recognised through the tartan's use throughout the year of Highland culture. We want such innovation. We want more and more people to invent tartans and to use them.</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13378124", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tartan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate is useful because Jamie McGrigor has got to the heart of one of the iconic symbols of Scotland and has forced the Government to respond.

The bill is equitable and achieves fairly small administrative changes that benefit crofters. Importantly, it makes a clear statement that it is possible to create new crofts, which we all agree is welcome.</p><p>The process has taken 10 years and, as the minister has just indicated, we have come a short way down a long road towards a consolidating bill. We need to find ways to speed up the process. I hope that we will be able to do that.</p><p>It is impossible to consider crofting seriously without considering the fabric of life in the crofting counties&#8212;that has been the SNP's policy for the past 30 years. That is why the crofting inquiry that will be undertaken later this year has a huge task in agreeing new priorities that have been raised during the consideration of the bill but which the bill was not designed to deliver.</p><p>Crofters face a gaggle of acronyms when trying to get support. However, the rural support scheme, the less favoured area support scheme, the crofting counties agricultural grants scheme&#8212;the RSS, the LFASS and the CCAGS&#8212;and the bull hire scheme are rather underfunded and, it is feared, begrudged. That is not the European Union's fault. If Scotland had full fiscal powers, it could invest in crofting as a nature-friendly element in a buoyant, sustainable economy in the Highlands and Islands. In the meantime, however, if we are to succeed, our ministers with responsibility for transport, enterprise, agriculture and health must all get in harness. If they do not, home production from crofts and public health will suffer.</p><p>It is important that we try to stem depopulation. The key question that must be asked in relation to the bill is whether it will stop further depopulation in areas that have great potential.</p><p>Speaking to the Environment and Rural Development Committee on behalf of active crofters, John MacKintosh, the former president of the Scottish Crofters Union, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I think that the reason why you get dereliction of crofts is that there is a complete and utter lack of realistic support for crofting and what crofting is about. Until we get that...fewer and fewer people will work those crofts...There are quite a few crofts that make a loss, so the crofter is left with one option, which is to start looking at the market and thinking of getting out.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Environment and Rural Development Committee</em>, 14 June 2006; c 3349-3350.]</p><p>That view is widely held, and we must be able to dispel it. If the bill can help that to happen, so much the better.</p><p>Crofts are small pieces of land surrounded by <place-holder colnum=\"31450\"/> large amounts of legislation. However, bureaucracy must not be allowed to strangle initiative. We need to restore the ability, the power, the will and the resources to rebuild our economic and social life across the crofting areas. Crofting needs young, new entrants and must try to use the experience that has been built up by small farmers organisations in Europe. If that mood is about, I am glad that this bill will be passed. The UHI Millennium Institute, broadband for all and croft-run renewable energy investment can all help us to turn the corner. Lessons from Norwegian communities show that small farms and crofts can earn huge electricity revenues to invest in local needs. However, that needs to be in the hands of the crofters.</p><p>The SNP has consistently supported land and seabed reform and crofting community buyouts. We want the role of the new crofting landlords to be examined carefully, because it is quite different from the role of the old private landlords. Ted Brocklebank's amendments touched on that matter, and I am glad to say that they were unsuccessful.</p><p>We welcome new crofts and forest crofts and ways in which small landholders can be welcomed into crofting tenure in places such as Arran. Those will be achieved, at last, by the bill.</p><p>The reforms have to tackle the lack of affordable housing that is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the great Highland scandal of modern times\",</p><p>as James Hunter writes in the brochure for the exhibition \"Fonn 's Duthcas: Land and Legacy\". Crofting can provide land for house building. I am sorry that we did not pass John Farquhar Munro's amendments this morning, as they would have emphasised the role of common grazings in achieving that.</p><p>Crofting underpins Gaelic and Norse cultures, whose confidence can play a vital part in reversing depopulation to retain and attract working families. If we can do that, we can integrate the north into the mainstream of Scotland's social, educational, agricultural and industrial life, with the help of ferry, rail and road links that are fit for this climate-change age. If crofting communities are to succeed, that has to happen. The bill has a small part to play in that.</p><p>The crofting communities have a big role to play in a sustainable future for our remarkable land.

In so saying, I think that everyone agrees that the development of the approved code is one thing that the committee has in mind.</p><p>Members have raised issues about fallowing fish farms, the use of existing sites and the fact that more than half the existing Crown Estate licences were not used in the past year. Indeed, 67 of the 252 licences have not been used at all in the past four years. The idea that planning permission should be sought for more and more sites must be questioned, particularly given the Marine Harvest&#8212;or Pan Fish, as it now is&#8212;application for a site off the coast of Arran. We do not need more sites; we need to sort out the ones that we have and use them better.

It is obvious that our understanding of the effects of Gyrodactylus salaris has not yet been tested. It is of considerable concern that we are making a law before the exercise in January and February takes place and can be evaluated. It is up to us to ensure that the Government keeps a close watch on how that is carried out. The import of GS would be devastating.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank commented on compensation for people who would be affected by such an outbreak. It is inconceivable to think about future compensation for Diageo or the whisky industry now. The costs would be so high that they cannot possibly taken on board at this stage. We must be careful about defining how compensation should be stated.</p><p>The question of live imports is the most crucial in preventing GS from getting here, but the situation in ports of entry is not yet clear. The GS task force called for stricter control, as has the committee. Education is one thing, but if members peruse the current leaflet on GS, they can see that it is not just Norway that has the disease: Sweden, Finland, Russia, Germany, France, Denmark, Spain and Portugal also all have sources. People travelling on angling trips to this country will be part of a problem that has to be solved at the port of entry.</p><p>Live fish imports are the biggest problem, and the question of how they will be policed gives us the greatest problem. Norway imported GS through smolts from Sweden, and we must clamp down on live fish imports. I hope that we will be able to agree that they are virtually a no-no.</p><p>A great deal could be said about the bill. I thank the members who made reasoned remarks, but I must comment, once again, that the Alasdair Morrison rant serves no purpose in helping us to make the best of what is a consensus.

Therefore, 41 per cent of activity is in the hands of local people with local rules. However, the quota stocks and the non-quota stocks all live in the same waters. Surely it is time for a comprehensive Scottish fishing plan. While we can have underwater cameras looking to see what the stocks of cod and haddock are, we do not have underwater cameras looking at the stocks of scallops. That suggests to me that, if we are going to have a total plan, that is the kind of argument that we have to have.

I will home in on how type 2 diabetes in adults is treated in our system.</p><p>Diabetic retinopathy screening is an important part of the checks to ensure that the eyesight of people with diabetes is secure. However, quality assurance issues have resulted in the national health service in Scotland moving to a more complicated system of checking how such screening is carried out. In the past, optometrists carried out screening as part of their regular check-ups for patients, but audit requirements to ensure that screening is carried out in a suitable fashion mean that each screening must be checked by at least four people. That has resulted in more screenings being done in hospitals rather than by optometrists in patients' own towns.</p><p>In the case of Raigmore hospital, that means extended journey times for patients, because they must wait some time before the eye-drops that they are given so that photographs can be taken wear off. I know of one case in which the photographs that were taken by the hospital technician were not good enough and had to be taken again. In the meantime&#8212;this story covers the months of October and November&#8212;the patient had an annual check-up with their local optometrist, who was able to do the job, which he does very well, with equipment that was up to scratch. The local optometrist was able to assure the patient that there was no problem.</p><p>It is important that in our system we recognise that around Scotland there are very different ways of handling the matter. In Orkney, an optometrist already has the kind of digital camera that can do the job, but the health board has also bought one. In Ayrshire, the health board has ensured that digital cameras are available to all optometrists. That best practice has allowed practices to deal with the issue close to where patients are. In <place-holder colnum=\"29291\"/> Highland, a software problem has resulted in a five-month backlog. In an attempt to catch up, patients who live relatively close to Inverness have been taken to hospital.</p><p>The minister needs to respond on the treatment of diabetics. According to the Kerr report, chronic conditions such as diabetes should be dealt with in the community, as close as possible to where patients are. I contend that, although optometrists have the necessary skills, the system should be organised to allow screening material to be transmitted by electronic means, so that the four experts who are required to consider cases under the new form of quality assurance are able to do so. The procedure should be carried out near to patients' homes, but checks should be made where the experts are.</p><p>The patient to whom I referred has fallen between two stools. Twice they were forced to travel much further than was necessary in order to have taken the right kind of photograph, although their optometrist was perfectly capable of carrying out the procedure locally. I ask the minister to ensure that when clinical services are audited the root reason why quality assurance is carried out in that way is identified. We want to avoid clinicians finding themselves in the same situation as those who were associated with the cervical smear problem in Inverclyde. Patient journeys must not be increased to the extent that patients are put at greater disadvantage, and we should make best use of the resources that are available. I would like the minister to respond to that point, because we want the NHS and optometrists to deliver screening procedures throughout Scotland in a suitable fashion.</p>", "hdate": "2006-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13371190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World Diabetes Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate David Davidson on securing this important debate on diabetes.

The problem that we always have with the Executive is that it puts out the questions but ignores the answers that do not fit and that it does not want.

We could easily have an electric rail service on the east coast route from Aberdeen; it would work far more efficiently and there would be lower carbon emissions. Is that the kind of target that the minister has been talking about? No; he has been talking about suburban lines and the central belt. Large sections of Scotland north of Perth and west of Aberdeen have never been invested in to any degree. Perhaps we should start to think in terms of electric railways in those large parts of Scotland where there are huge electricity resources. That might seem to be a bit futuristic, but it is quite practical.</p><p>The rail infrastructure will continue to have bottlenecks such as those that we have on the Fife circle, so we need to undertake the kind of planning and programmes that the Irish have undertaken in their &#163;30 billion programme for rail and roads that is opening up lines all over the country, not just in the suburban areas. I hope that the debate gets some answers to such questions and I thank the Greens for raising these matters. We really have to use the carrot and not always the stick.</p><p>Another interesting development is the way in which tarmac surfaces&#8212;on roads, airport runways, transport yards or supermarket car parks&#8212;can have a water heating system put below them that creates energy to heat the road or reduce the heat on it and also to heat water for nearby buildings. The costs of running major roads could be reduced by installing such heating systems as they are now doing in the Netherlands. Companies in this country, such as Invisible Heating Systems Ltd in Ullapool, are involved in that kind of work, but it is in its infancy. The Carbon Trust needs to back that kind of approach because it could lead to the creation of modern roads that do not suffer so much from wear and tear and so have reduced maintenance costs. We <place-holder colnum=\"28551\"/> do not have any of that kind of thinking permeating transport at present.</p><p>I realise that we cannot compare ourselves directly with the likes of Sweden.

Calls for a supremo to drive forward the vision in the document have yet to be accepted, but as Jamie Stone&#8212;whom we thank for securing this debate&#8212;said, we really must sort out the issue. Although the strategy has been chaired by John Thurso MP, it needs a leader with the powers to order the partners to deliver. The Scottish National Party sees the strategy as having a far greater impact on Caithness than the closure of Ravenscraig had on Lanarkshire, for example. That is how important it is.</p><p>I venture to say that the Scottish ministers should take on the supremo role in promoting plans for the sustainable future of the far north. At present the split between the powers of the Scottish Government and those of the London Government is a definite hindrance. Nevertheless, the Scottish ministers cannot escape their ultimate responsibility to help the far north to flourish. In the short time that is available to me, I will suggest three immediate priorities that could help us along and could form the basis of a very public campaign. All those issues could be decided here in Scotland right now.</p><p>First, we need a highly vocal campaign to upgrade our transport services to and from the far north. We need a 21<sup>st</sup> century railway, including realistic costings for a Dornoch link&#8212;such costings have yet to be established independently. There must be an end to the divisions at all levels in the community south of Golspie and in the Highlands and Islands strategic transport partnership, and there must be a positive commitment from Government. The age of climate change in which we live is also the age of the train. The four-hour journey to Inverness is the longest and slowest in the UK, on the poorest rolling stock. It is a modern disgrace. An upgraded railway is needed alongside various programmed road improvements, such as improvements in the Berriedale braes&#8212;not one or the other.</p><p>Secondly, we need a commitment from HIE and from the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to back a centre of excellence based in Caithness. The SNP has long believed that we should be able to export nuclear decommissioning skills and to co-operate with the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney to promote wave and tidal power in the Pentland firth. North Highland <place-holder colnum=\"28499\"/> College in Thurso is well placed to do that work. I welcome what Jamie Stone said about sharing the potential with Aberdeen.</p><p>Thirdly, we need to campaign for enhanced local powers to make decisions in Caithness. Indeed, when the new multimember wards are set up, we will need decisions to be made in Caithness, with some budget allocated to the local government structure. We should be aiming for that.</p><p>Dornoch and Golspie need commuters on the rail service, and it would be an act of faith if the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and UKAEA made some small but tangible gesture of their corporate social responsibility. The Dornoch link action group has secured &#163;5,000 to commission a study by rail consultants that will examine the link's potential. All that we need is another &#163;5,000. Surely, those big bodies can find that for us. That is a small challenge with which to end my speech.</p><p>We need a Caithness strategy that thinks big.

That 1.5 per cent is vital to life; the other 98 per cent or 98.5 per cent could not happen without it. The way in which our Government enables that industry to provide its vital products for consumers to eat is of paramount importance. That is why today's debate about the Environment and Rural Development Committee inquiry into the food supply chain is absolutely vital to every Scot.</p><p>The lack of transparency in the system, which has been mentioned by many members, affects not only the consumer, who is given very poor labelling that has not improved, but the producer and those who cannot find out where in the market or supply chain the profits are being made. That is something that people ought to be able to find out. The position in which we find ourselves is that we, the consumers and the producers, are being farmed by the shareholders of the big four supermarkets. That is an appalling situation to be in. The supermarkets, which have shareholders around the world, are farming us. That is no way for us to conduct a food policy. I say to the minister that we need not a free market but a fair market. The tenor of today's debate has been that we need the regulation and input from Government that will allow the existence of a fair market.</p><p>Business support, or the way in which we apply the limited common agricultural policy funds, is a major issue. The supports that allow people to produce high-quality food are being cut and the minister can do something about that, but farm diversification is only part of the solution&#8212;the minister and the Government have other powers that could be applied On the big supermarkets, people can park for nothing in the car parks of out-of-town supermarkets whereas, if they use a small shop in the town centre, they will probably need to pay parking charges. I do not suggest for a minute that the large numbers of people who use supermarkets should be required to pay parking charges, but the supermarkets should be paying far higher rates. The supermarkets could also be encouraged to stock local produce and to carry <place-holder colnum=\"28160\"/> their goods by rail in order to reduce problems on our roads. However, the planning bills that we consider never deal with those issues. The Executive must get involved in such regulation and start to help consumers and producers alike.</p><p>There is a warning in our report on the position of the consumer. Paragraph 62 of the committee's report warns that to allow</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a short-term focus solely on the current prices faced by consumers risks undermining the viability of farm businesses, which will have long-term effects on the choice, freshness, quality and price of food available to consumers.\"</p><p>The minister has a role in relation to public health and is trying to make it possible for people to live better. Is he intervening to ensure that consumers are given better education and are better equipped to tackle what they are presented with on supermarket shelves? Convenience food is often poor food.</p><p>Parliament should not condone the supermarkets' making bloated profits. The minister intervened during Richard Lochhead's speech to say that a rational debate is needed, but it cannot be rational that the Tescos of this world make such bloated profits at our expense, not only from our pockets but, to some extent, from our health. I seek responses from the minister on that point, because we need to bring about a sea change. Governments can to some extent help to create a fairer market.</p><p>In her book \"Bad Food Britain\", Joanna Blythman talks about</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Britain's long-standing food philistinism that sees money spent on fleeting pleasures such as artisan cheese, a well-hung, patiently reared piece of meat or a unique and special bottle of wine, as money down the drain.\"</p><p>She continues:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"New trainers, a flat screen TV, another car? Now those are solid things that endure, for a while at least, and they buy you status in the eyes of friends, neighbours, colleagues and classmates.\"</p><p>Too often, in our society of consumerism, it is the second set of values that comes to the fore. If we are to change society&#8212;the food chain inquiry was about trying to change attitudes&#8212;we must get people to appreciate good food, rather than cheap food. I am interested in hearing how the minister will suggest that we should intervene to put out that message, because in Scotland we can do more.</p><p>As other members have said, Governments in other countries in Europe ensure that their consumers are presented with local food.

By 1886, Gladstone had created a regulated market to protect crofters' rights to their land. In 2006, Ross Finnie, one of his heirs, was prepared to remove that vital constraint and turn the clock <place-holder colnum=\"27886\"/> back, while a succession of his Labour deputies turned their backs on crofters and the vision needed to meet today's opportunities in our most vulnerable Highlands and Islands. Rather than underpinning crofters' initiatives, the bill reeks of pandering to landlords.</p><p>Rhona Brankin has pulled the remains together, but they salvage only a handful of positive points, such as the need to put in primary legislation the means to create new crofts, which is an excellent and welcome addition; to ensure that the Crofters Commission does its long-standing job; to make the register of crofts accurate; and to allow crofters to pay landlords for the privilege of buying back interposed leases.</p><p>Two shafts of wisdom were launched at the bill's rotten heart by seasoned Lochaber crofter John MacKintosh. At our committee hearing on 14 June, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I think that the reason why you get dereliction of crofts is that there is a complete and utter lack of realistic support for crofting and what crofting is about. Until we get that...fewer and fewer people will work those crofts...There are quite a few crofts that make a loss, so the crofter is left with one option, which is to start looking at the market and thinking of getting out.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Environment and Rural Development Committee</em>, 14 June 2006; c 3349-3350.]</p><p>The most contentious issue that we dealt with was the late and huge proposed amendment from the minister to regulate owner-occupier crofters, who make up a fifth of the total crofters, as proper occupiers. On that, John MacKintosh said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It has not taken 30 years to uncover the issue. In fact, a group that met in 1998 was aware of it and said that owner-occupiers and tenants should have the same status...There was consensus in the group, which involved the Scottish Landowners Federation, the then Scottish Crofters Union and the Crofters Commission. Sir Crispin Agnew chaired the group and the secretary of the commission was involved.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Environment and Rural Development Committee</em>, 14 June 2006; c 3344.]</p><p>Commenting on the cut-down bill, the Scottish Crofting Foundation president Norman Leask said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In the meantime, there are a number of helpful concessions in this paper...In particular...addressing overt speculation on croft land, putting a duty on the Commission to use their existing regulatory powers and addressing anomalies between the welcomed power to create new crofts and other proposals which would act as a disincentive on doing this.\"</p><p>Only a high-powered inquiry with a broad remit, a distinguished convener who is above the current debate and a fixed timetable will enable new legislation to secure sustainable development and security for crofting to be considered, probably next session. In the meantime, the Crofters Commission must be made to use all of its powers. It must ensure that grazings committees are transparent and inclusive. The tendency of the commission and SEERAD to downplay the part <place-holder colnum=\"27887\"/> played in crofting by agricultural production is at odds with the demand for more locally sourced food and traceable livestock.</p><p>Crofting schemes such as the less favoured area support scheme and the crofting counties agricultural grants scheme, as well as the remains of the bull hire scheme, have to meet the needs of the least capitalised and most disadvantaged townships.</p><p>Crofting rules must match aspirations, such as those of the local food producers network that Highlands and Islands Enterprise launched. The shift from sheep to cattle could be actively underpinned. However, local agreement is at the root of progress and trust is at the root of local agreement.</p><p>As I said, extending crofting beyond the current crofting counties is a welcome move, but the plight of the small landholders in Arran and other parts has been ignored, from the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1955 to the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Seven years of monumental expenditure has been used on false trails in the bill. Arran tenants cannot be abandoned again. If it costs time and staff to sort their problem, so be it.</p><p>The interposed leases question was known about before the 2003 act was passed. The Pairc buyout plan in Lewis is in the balance. The urgent land reform review that has been promised and the test case in the Scottish Land Court must dovetail with the crofting inquiry to resolve the issues.</p><p>Responsibility for the protracted mess ultimately is political.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13367712", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting Reform etc Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Few of the original proposals in the Crofting Reform etc Bill are left unscathed.

In the Parliament, we have asked before now about the use of money for investment in energy.

That is the kind of equation that the Tories have yet to face; it is one of the rough edges that they have not dealt with as the debate has developed.</p><p>In his opening speech for the SNP, Richard Lochhead pointed out that Scotland has one of the biggest potentials in Europe for the production of green power. It is important to remember that we have not discussed how other countries have tackled green energy production through combined heat and power. Sweden, Holland and Denmark&#8212;which, unlike Britain, have not had large amounts of oil in the past 25 years&#8212;moved on apace to create local energy in large measure by combining heat and power.

In Scotland, our total policy for ensuring that people can travel around must be based partly on public transport, but we must also ensure that people who live in rural areas can drive their cars at reasonable cost.

Everyone is agreed that we want to ensure that Scotland sets a benchmark for the way in which we treat our old people.</p><p>However, the way in which free personal care has been rolled out across the country is a cause for considerable concern. I found it interesting to note the remarks that were made in the committee's written evidence, especially from organisations in my area. For example, the submission from the Highland community care partnership states that the definition of what is included as personal care and therefore within the policy has not caused too many problems in Highland. However, it goes on to say that the partnership was conscious that the definition has caused some problems across the country. The submission also states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Highland Council argued for national eligibility criteria on the basis that this would remove the risk of a post code lottery. We consider the introduction of such criteria continues to have merit.\"</p><p>Like us, the Highland community care partnership believes that the eligibility criteria are not clear. That point has been made by speaker after speaker this afternoon.</p><p>Another issue concerns the services that are available. In response to the committee's FOI request about the funding for free personal care that Highland had received from the Government and how much it had been required to spend on those services in 2005-06, the council said that it had received &#163;6.033 million but had had to spend &#163;7.816 million&#8212;or about a third more. That is a large amount of money out of a small council's budget. Although in June the council was unable to answer questions about how long it took to assess people or to provide the care package, I was pleased to read in <em>The Herald</em> today that assessments are initiated within an average of five days and that providing the package takes no time at all.</p><p>However, I am concerned about the accuracy not only of those figures&#8212;which, after all, were put together only from June onwards&#8212;but of the figures in other parts of the country. I hope that with the Government's proposed review a good deal more effort is made to ensure that the figures are very accurate.</p><p>The budget constraints under which, for example, the social work department in the Highland Council is working are cutting away at its ability to deliver some of these services. In 2005-06, it had to make savings of &#163;750,000 in the elderly care element of its budget, while next year <place-holder colnum=\"27661\"/> it will have to make &#163;2.6 million worth of cuts in the overall social work budget. Those constraints are being imposed at a time when the difficulties of delivering many of these services to small and scattered communities and in unusual conditions are becoming clear. In this debate, we must make it clear that, if the provision of services is not to become a postcode lottery, the assessment of actual need must be more focused.</p><p>At the heart of the debate is the question of how older people in different circumstances are cared for. Highland is an unusual case, as 23 per cent of the beds available for elderly care are under the local authority's control. That said, I should note that the Highland senior citizens network is concerned to find out whether public sector beds will be available for various purposes. After all, if we are going to get rid of bed-blocking, we will also need places for and means of assessing older people. However, certain private providers such as the Church of Scotland and the Salvation Army might well pull out of delivering such services. That concern has led to the call for beds provided by the council to remain available, even though they are more expensive than beds provided by the private sector.</p><p>The point is that we need a proper assessment of the money required to deliver services. Indeed, in the past two weeks, considerable concern has been expressed about certain developments in Orkney. As one old man put it, people should not have to be deported from their homeland in order to find care. People in Orkney are asking for new care homes for the elderly to be built, presumably in the public sector.</p><p>We must recognise that the Scottish index of multiple deprivation does not work in our area. Given that there is more than one geography of poverty in Scotland, no single index will do the trick for both urban and rural areas. Will the Executive continue with an area-based assessment of deprivation or will it take the kind of thematic approach that is much more suited to small communities and sparsely-populated areas? People in smaller communities such as Assynt, Tain and Fort William need a policy that provides them with the best service.</p><p>There is still much to do. However, we have made a start. Now the Executive must assure people in the Highlands that their elderly will continue to be looked after in their own communities.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13367099", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Care Inquiry"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The free personal care services that are available are a massive step forward for our older people.

However, to achieve the modal shift in transport use that is part of the Government-agreed Highland Council strategic plan, we need a hugely improved rail network that can accommodate increased volumes of freight and passengers and a vastly improved and integrated road public transport system that runs on better planned roads. That means that there should be double rail tracks from Perth to Inverness, the roof of the Killiecrankie tunnel should be heightened to take freight containers, the Aberdeen to Inverness line, which is shorter than the road, should be speeded up and money should be spent on shortening the far north rail line by building the Dornoch rail link.

I want to explore the things that the past and current waves of immigrants can teach us about how to handle things.</p><p>Maureen Macmillan's motion focuses on the population increase of the Highlands and islands, which is partly due to migrant workers coming into the country, but is also due to relatively wealthy and elderly retirees. The figures mask the outward movement of young Scots who seek education, wider experience and well-paid work in other parts of Scotland, Europe and abroad. Our people are part of the migrant trail for the same reasons that <place-holder colnum=\"26737\"/> people come from eastern Europe to this country. The people who leave do not have things such as affordable housing, which they would hope to have if they ever return, although the fear of not having such housing might deter them from returning. Likewise, the likelihood that there will be enough well-paid jobs that can be supported in a balanced Highland economy is missing.</p><p>The incoming migrants obviously suffer from a shortage of well-paid work and of affordable housing, so the people who are forced to leave and the people who are coming in face the same problems, which the Government has yet to address. Across the parties, we recognise that providing homes for those on modest incomes is a huge issue. We want to ensure that affordable homes are available, but we have not managed to solve that problem for the people who are already in the country, so it is doubly important that the minister finds ways of tackling those problems and that the Scottish Executive recognises that everyone in the Parliament wants that to happen. Otherwise, we will never be able to welcome people on a more permanent basis.</p><p>The taxi firm that I use to get to Inverness station on the way to Parliament cannot find drivers for the wages that it is prepared to offer. Immigrants would be able to do those jobs if it were not for the language barrier, but we do not have enough teachers to help those immigrants to do those jobs and many others. Young Scots go abroad and teach English as a foreign language. We need to recruit them to teach here, and I hope that the minister can tell us a bit about what he intends to do in that respect.</p><p>When we consider the experience of migrants to our country, we should not forget that some of them can fall foul of other rules. Maureen Macmillan mentioned in passing the case of Sakchai Makao. The problems created for migrants is not an issue that we have a great deal of time to deal with in detail in this debate, but they must be taken into account in the overall picture. I would like to think that we can take a more comprehensive approach to housing and well-paid jobs but, when people want to stay, the fundamental thing is the ability to have their children educated in our schools and to be taught the English language. We must have people who are capable of teaching them. If we are to make progress on the migrant issue for the Highlands, that is the area that needs the most investment.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Migrant Workers (Highlands)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Maureen Macmillan for raising the subject.

However, it is necessary to comment on remarks that have been made throughout the debate to see why we need the full powers of a normal country to tackle the climate change problem. Looking over our shoulder and having to consult further south is not the best means of making progress.</p><p>The Executive acknowledged in its response to the Environment and Rural Development Committee's report on climate change that national emissions reduction targets were not currently feasible due to the fact that the Executive does not have full control over the levers required to deliver them. The SNP believes that, following that admission, the situation must be sorted out. <place-holder colnum=\"26589\"/></p><p>Indeed, if we are to achieve the climate change targets that I think people are trying to grapple with, we must have our hands on those levers.</p><p>Richard Lochhead made a plea for a major push on energy efficiency, which many members mentioned, to make it more publicly high profile and available. The question of how 700,000 houses can be climate-proofed is a practical one, but that could create a lot of work for private businesses. The win-win situation to which we referred earlier is part of that. However, when we look at \"Changing Our Ways\", we can see the plethora of bodies that have been set up in the private sector, in local authorities and so on to deal with energy efficiency. I think that a one-stop shop, as mentioned in the SNP amendment, would be a good way in which to give energy efficiency a far higher profile. If the Tories actually believe that we should make a difference, the SNP's amendment, which deals with energy efficiency matters practically, is well worth their support.</p><p>Mark Ruskell talked about the difficulties of the hard target in transport. In his contribution to the climate change debate in March 2005, the then Minister for Transport said of the growth in transport:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We must do whatever is realistically possible to limit that continuing growth.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Environment and Rural Development Committee</em>, 2 March 2005; c 1735.]</p><p>Unless we have major investment in public transport, we will not be able to do that.</p><p>It is possible, however, in the fuels that we produce, to make Scotland a centre of excellence for clean road fuels&#8212;I mention the Argent Energy factory development for biodiesel in Lanarkshire and the potential for energy crops. Andrew Welsh mentioned the problems of getting those issues to the forefront of the debate. Hydrogen technology is also proven and requires to be developed. The Government's efforts to create the potential for people to adapt to liquid petroleum gas has been a massive failure, given the potential that exists to get people thinking about changing the fuels that they use.</p><p>It is up to us to ensure that all the departments in the Government are made to announce, each year, how much carbon they are using, how much they are saving and the costs that they are incurring in the process. Unless the reports from the Government to the Parliament detail that information from each Executive department, we are going to lose out.</p><p>A number of issues relating to governance require answers from the minister. The European Union's energy efficiency directives must be brought together in each country. I want to know when the energy efficiency strategy in its various <place-holder colnum=\"26590\"/> stages will be announced in Scotland. It is essential for us to know how we are going to achieve, how much we are going to achieve and over what timescale.</p><p>The Executive was going to involve all the relevant departments in developing an adaptation policy framework&#8212;a clearer picture of what adaptation is, where the gaps are and what better coordination is required in terms of the governance issues that relate to Executive departments' behaviour. I wonder whether the minister will respond to that point, given his comment in response to paragraph 272 of the committee's climate change report. I have not yet found the Executive's response to that recommendation in \"Changing Our Ways\". It would be useful for us to know that.</p><p>Maureen Macmillan dwelt on many of the important renewables developments that are happening. However, when one sees the list that shows that we are falling behind on the potential for wave and tidal&#8212;indeed, we are falling behind on the development of much of the technology&#8212;the areas of failed investment show the large amount that we have to catch up and why not having all the levers of power in Government has put us at a disadvantage.</p><p>John Scott talked about new forms of energy coming from hydro power. Do we not have a problem with water in this country, which we inherited from the Tories? I am talking about all the leaky pipes in the water system that they failed to deal with when they were in power.</p><p>John Home Robertson raised the issue of filling the energy gap with nuclear power. If we develop the Talisman Energy project to its full potential and if we develop the hydrogen scheme at Peterhead, that will deal with a third of Scottish household needs. If we added to that the Pentland firth's potential for tidal energy, we would be in a position not only to bridge the gap, but to export energy from our renewable sources, if we had a Government that set such a target.</p><p>There are many things to be said about the way in which the Government is operating. I focus finally on Jamie Stone's speech. If he is happy with the way in which the coalition is operating, I wonder whether he will be happy if there is another Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition&#8212;let us hope that there is not&#8212;and the nuclear waste is dumped at Altnabreac, in his constituency. That is the prospect for the future of Scotland. The SNP's alternative, which focuses on raising popular support for energy efficiency and getting ministers to show how we are improving on our carbon reductions, would be a practical way to try to stave off that awful nuclear future.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364234", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In a wide-ranging debate, the Scottish National Party has tried to focus on several practical means of making progress.

If that kind of town architecture&#8212;which is being fostered because the town centres have been destroyed and building has taken place on the outskirts&#8212;is to continue, a large part of the heritage that we pass on will not be as memorable as some of the examples that I have given from the past.</p><p>If the new architecture is going to be imaginative and forward thinking, it must also be affordable.

A wider-ranging approach needs to be taken in planning; one that involves master planning and public participation. Those are the techniques that allow core values to be spread to and from the community councils and so on. There are many examples that we can take from other countries of how that should be done in Scotland. <place-holder colnum=\"26353\"/></p><p>We look to the Government to incorporate more of those values in the architectural briefs that it is drawing up, not only in terms of the Planning (Scotland) Bill, but elsewhere.</p><p>A building that I have mentioned previously in this context is the award-winning house that was built for the artist Lotte Glob on the side of Loch Eriboll. During the last RIAS competition, it won the public prize. The house, which is made of wood and other locally-sourced materials, cost &#163;70,000 to build. It is not only much better insulated than the artist's previous house, but it is built on a sloping site. That is the kind of land that is not so useful for agriculture; it is the kind of land on which many rural buildings should be built. Lotte Glob's house is the kind of example that we want to encourage.</p><p>Frank McAveety talked about his grandparents coming to the Gorbals from County Cavan. During that part of the 19th century, when the famine had taken hold in Ireland and, indeed, when the clearances were taking place in Scotland, people began to build more dispersed settlements. However, in order to get affordable housing in the countryside, we know that we have to build houses in clusters. I am talking not about houses being built cheek by jowl in the \"Brookside\" fashion, but in communities. The kind of planning that allows for community development therefore needs to be built into the thoughts of architects and their way of working.</p><p>I turn to the point about the local authorities that we make in our amendment. Far too often, local authorities are involved in trying to perpetuate a view of the countryside as being a place where only small white-painted houses can be located; houses that look beautiful but which are totally out of place nowadays. The situation of architects having to design houses that look like the houses that were built in the 18<sup>th</sup> century but which have a 21<sup>st</sup> century interior is desperate. The Scottish National Party expects local authorities to be more imaginative on the issue.</p><p>I can think of far too many examples in which a proposal to build the kind of wooden house that I referred to earlier meets vast resistance at local government level. That is why I echo the argument that many more architects should be involved in planning departments and that such a development should be funded from the centre, which would ensure that progressive architectural values were taken on board.</p><p>The type of housing that we build is our legacy for the future. If Scotland is to be seen as a progressive country, our housing has to be seen to be the hallmark of the nation.

Positive planning involves more than just regulating pieces of land. It is an holistic process with vision that enables the planning process to be owned by the people of the communities that it is intended to free. Like Patrick Harvie, I believe that whether it is certain that people's views will have real weight in the planning process is still open to question, given the processes that the bill proposes. I will give some examples of issues that arise in my area, and I am interested to see how they will be dealt with.</p><p>Recently, the Environment and Rural Development Committee has been taking oral evidence on the Crofting Reform etc Bill at stage 1. It is the general view that the Crofters Commission and crofting communities should have a role in deciding where housing developments take place, before the planning stage is reached. That would give communities a real ability to participate in and have ownership of plans. In September last year, when preparing for stage 1 of the Crofting Reform etc Bill, I asked whether the Minister for Environment and Rural Development, the Minister for Communities and the Crofters Commission had met to examine the implications of the proposed planning bill for the development of common grazing land, of which there is a great deal in crofting communities. The answer was that there had been \"no formal discussions\" but that the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development would meet the Minister for Communities on 19 October. That concerned me considerably.<place-holder colnum=\"25669\"/></p><p>The issue is relevant to much of the area that I represent, from Shetland to Kintyre. Small, sparsely populated communities are becoming even more sparsely populated because planning is strangling the life out of many rural areas. We need answers to the question of how much the bill will help us to deal with that. If ministers are serious, the articulation between the Planning etc (Scotland) Bill and the Crofting Reform etc Bill, which is slightly behind it, must take place rapidly. If it does not, there will be questions about whether the Crofters Commission will be a statutory consultee, although that measure alone would be insufficient to secure development that is appropriate in crofting areas. I am not a member of the Communities Committee but, having read the report, which is a vast document, at least in outline, I have grave reservations about such issues. From my practical experience on the ground, I do not know that the way in which plans are developed embraces the concept that they must be holistic and visionary. In the past, they have been part of the regulatory process to far too great an extent.</p><p>I welcome the fact that affordable housing could become a use class, which would help us to decide that there should be more of it in areas that need it, especially rural areas. At the moment, village envelopes prevent people from living on large areas of the countryside. Scotland is becoming a place in which fewer and fewer Scots get to live in the countryside, except in smaller and smaller areas. Although areas on the edge of cities are expanding, large areas in which there is the potential for more people to live are being strangled by the processes of planning legislation.</p><p>In the past, planning advice notes have been interpreted in widely differing ways by different local authorities. The committee's report suggests that there must be much more consistency of application. I would like to think that planning determinations could lead to a wider definition of \"the public good\". For example, when supermarkets are developed, is there potential in planning to say that large amounts of goods must be transported by rail, rather than by road? Could we require supermarkets to transport goods to the nearest railhead, before transferring them to road? After all, supermarkets are very rich. They could easily help us in other planning areas. Are ministers thinking about that kind of approach at national planning framework level?</p><p>At present, local communities are blighted because of national decisions that were made in the past. I cite the example of coastal super-quarries. I do not need to remind those who were members in the first session of the Parliament how long it took to reject the proposal for south Harris. Planning authorities decide that areas should be identified for super-quarries, and small <place-holder colnum=\"25670\"/> communities can be blighted by national decisions. The national planning framework must articulate with the needs of very local areas. I have yet to see in the detail of the proposals whether that will happen. In particular, I look for answers from the minister in her response to the debate in respect of the provisions that relate to crofting.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361873", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The fulcrum of this debate is whether people are to feel that they are participants rather than just consultees.

If I may sum up the debate simply, many members have expressed the concern that Historic Scotland has a massive task and that there does not seem to be enough money for it to do it. If we want to renovate buildings, we must decide what priority that should have in Government funding. Obviously, we have to take from one thing to give to another&#8212;it is not an easy equation. This afternoon, no one is saying that there is an easy way of solving the problem. However, far too many members mentioned the fact that we find ourselves with a listing process that is inconsistent. It was interesting that Christine Grahame referred to the government buildings in Gala and their previous use. She also made the case for Abbotsford, which was enhanced to some extent by Jeremy Purvis. That set of listings was problematic. It seems that again and again we <place-holder colnum=\"25117\"/> lose buildings because the process is not streamlined.</p><p>As a practising historian, I have been concerned for many years about the way in which our historic environment is interpreted. It is easy for me to explain my concerns with reference to a place that has not been mentioned so far. There is a Scottish Natural Heritage reserve at Loch Kinord in Deeside. It has an excellent display, explanation board and car park at the Burn o' Vat. At that very place, there was a major battle in Scottish history&#8212;the battle of Culblean on St Andrew's day in 1335&#8212;but the SNH material says nothing about that human activity. Some 50 years ago, a plaque was erected on a huge granite boulder about half a mile along the road, but the two things are not married. As the minister said, we must get some of our unique resources working together. She also mentioned the need for regional and national Government to work together on such matters.</p><p>Another important site is the land where the Falkirk tryst, the great cattle sales in Falkirk, took place. Thankfully, some of the grounds still exist because they are on a golf course, but the fact that there is not a built environment on the land makes it more difficult to interpret. Part of that land, on which major events took place for more than a century, has been sold for housing. However, I am glad to say that Falkirk Council, which Michael Matheson knows well, has refused to consider housing proposals for sites that are on the golf course, despite the golf club being interested in trying to capitalise on the land. The council has recognised the recreational and historic value of the site. That is an example of local government applying itself to maintain a site that is part of our folklore.</p><p>Several members, including Donald Gorrie and Robin Harper, have mentioned historic trees. A register of trees in the Planning etc (Scotland) Bill would be very useful. One such tree, which is illustrated elsewhere in the Parliament building, is an ancient, gnarled Spanish chestnut on Inchmahome, on the Lake of Menteith. That is the very place where Robert Cunninghame Graham and his wife are buried. Robert Cunninghame Graham wrote about the Falkirk tryst. He was also one of the founders of the Scottish Labour Party and the Scottish National Party. The tree on that island is one of the most beautiful spots in central Scotland. Some people visit it, but not enough people realise that in its natural setting such a fabulous ancient tree matters more than just the people. It would be helpful if something were done to recognise ancient trees.</p><p>A lot of the historic landscape is also a working landscape, such as the crofting landscape of my own part of the world. It has been said that the stone walls in the north-east of Scotland are a <place-holder colnum=\"25118\"/> testament to near slavery, but they are part of a landscape that has been created by working people, and the land is still worked to this day. We must find ways to encourage the redevelopment of such places of interest through the rural development plan, which we discussed this morning, and through Historic Scotland taking an interest in many of the basic buildings that are used by ordinary people.</p><p>There is a massive emphasis on public buildings, the large houses of the gentry and so on. Those buildings are all unique, but the minister was correct to recognise that, as Des McNulty pointed out, excellence is an important element when we consider what should be allocated priority and money. It concerns me that we continually spend money on properties that, although unique, are not of particular historic value beyond the fact that a dusty history book mentions that some laird or whatever stayed in them at some point. We must make choices.</p><p>Elaine Murray mentioned the desperate need to establish who owns derelict properties in our towns and in the countryside. I share Robin Harper's view that we ought to use fiscal means, such as a land value tax, to get derelict buildings used or into the hands of people who will use them.</p><p>There is far too much to cover in the short time that I have, but I wanted to mention some of those examples, because they add to the colourful picture that we can build on in Scotland. Historic Scotland has been given a new plan, but I hope that the minister can assure us that more resources will be made available and that its activities will be prioritised to ensure that many more people in the country can enjoy the historic environment. Many members have given good examples of that environment from their constituencies.</p>", "hdate": "2006-04-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13360479", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In this most interesting debate about the roots of our national and historic environment, we have concentrated a great deal on buildings, although not entirely to the detriment of rural areas and the countryside.

We all know that there are far starker challenges for people who attempt to make their living in rural areas than there are for many of the people who pursue career opportunities in our cities. This is an age of flight from the countryside to the cities, especially by young people, so it is vital that we reverse the population drain from the countryside. Determination of whether the Scottish rural development programme encourages that such a reversal should be one benchmark for the people who judge the suitability of the measures that the Scottish Environment and Rural Affairs Department proposes.</p><p>For my starting point, I take the truism that James Hunter uttered in the first evidence-taking session on the Crofting Reform etc Bill. He remarked that few crofters make a full-time living from agriculture and said that it follows that the viability of crofting communities at any point depends more on the health of the wider rural economy of which crofters are part than purely and simply on agriculture. A version of that statement could be applied to most parts of Scotland; few farmers nowadays rely solely on agricultural income. Many rely on the off-farm incomes of their spouses or partners, so the programme that we are discussing will be vital in enhancing the incomes of rural land holders. That has been widely agreed.</p><p>The SNP broadly agrees with the Government that several elements have to be in place in pursuing a development strategy. Of course, quality food production and forestry output must be underpinned. We must deliver enhanced rural landscapes and natural heritage for the public good, and we must diversify economic activities in the rural economy, which will underpin thriving rural communities. How such things are done will vary and will depend on soil quality, location, population sparsity, remoteness and climate of the areas concerned. There is a massive task for people sitting in the department in thinking themselves into the positions of folk who live in such diverse circumstances.</p><p>Europe has recognised that these are strategic aims. How we organise our schemes to meet conditions in Scotland will be key to the success of the structure from 2007 to 2013. Will we be allowed to secure funding from Europe that is untouched by the Blair-Brown clawback proposals? As the minister said, we are unsure about the reduction in the amount that will be <place-holder colnum=\"25005\"/> available for the programmes. We would like an assurance from the minister that there will be no stinting on spending on the programmes in the period. Our having as much money as possible and that money's not being diverted to other purposes are vital for the future of Scotland's rural areas. I also seek ministerial discipline for the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department to create clarity of process and baseline data from which to work, and I seek transparent targets so that an outcome can be achieved in each element of the plan that we can debate in future reviews of progress.</p><p>The briefing from the Soil Association states that far greater importance should be accorded to monitoring progress towards desired outcomes and that that monitoring should begin with a comprehensive analysis of baseline data. I wonder whether members are presented with material that allows us to see what progress has been made and where we stand when we start to apply new forms of regulation to cover the next period. Such material will have to be considered.</p><p>Aims in the three axes that are outlined in the consultation&#8212;which are improving the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, improving the environment and the countryside and improving the quality of life in rural areas&#8212;could all be delivered by organic agriculture, for example. There are sometimes uncertainties about the support mechanisms for organic agriculture&#8212;I see Tory members starting to fidget&#8212;but many people throughout the country believe, as the Soil Association does, that organic agriculture is vital. Further development of organic food and farming should be a key identified priority in the final document. I hope that it will be.</p><p>I am concerned as a result of meetings that I hold in rural communities that producers find that the overlapping and changing conditions of all the interlocking schemes create huge administrative burdens for farmers, crofters or foresters who are not accountants or professional form fillers, although many would qualify for degrees in agricultural administration by accredited prior learning. I suppose that the career that is most on the advance in rural areas is that of the consultant who helps people to fill in their forms&#8212;some benefits result from having a complex system. If forms are to stack up in the vaults of Pentland House, surely it is necessary to think about how greater integration can be achieved. The one-stop shop approach in various parts of the programme is to be welcomed, but inventing new paper streams will not make things simpler.</p><p>I turn to the less favoured area support scheme. I am concerned that the sustainability of many communities is on the edge. If the moneys that are made available by the programme are to be based <place-holder colnum=\"25006\"/> on historical payments in 2006, that can disadvantage some people. On Monday, I heard evidence from a young crofter in Lewis who is trying to get a quota from the national reserve for this year&#8212;there are people who are mad enough to try to make a start in agriculture at the moment, but if they do not start at the right time, much of the base of the spending from the programmes may not be available to them. Such things are happening although sheep numbers have fallen by around 10 per cent in the past year. If people want to come into agriculture, there should be a flexible mechanism that will enable them to do so. I have not seen such a mechanism described in the documents that have been presented.</p><p>Cattle numbers are also falling, and they need to be supported through the SRDP proposals. About a third of the annual support of &#163;61 million that is provided by the LFASS represents a significant environmental measure. The discussion about how the RSPB lobbied needs to be seen in the light of practical experience. In the fragile north and west of the country, removing top-up payments for keeping cattle is likely to accelerate decline. The minister has acknowledged that it is difficult to reach a definition because we must move away from headage, but it is essential that a definition be made. It was interesting to hear primary pupils at Rosehall last Friday talking about their environmental trip to Islay, where they were told about the survival of the rare chough, which relies on a beetle that lives in cattle dung. If the number of cattle is reduced, the potential for that bird to survive will be minimised.</p>", "hdate": "2006-04-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13360217", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Development Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish National Party welcomes the measures for the rural economy and environmental development that can support existing families, and hopes that they can lead to more people choosing to live and work in our rural areas.

Colleagues will expand on that matter.</p><p>We are glad that the review of the land management contract tier 2 menu is under way. The one-stop-shop test is vital to make that work. However, can we be reassured about another <place-holder colnum=\"25007\"/> element? The consultation document jocularly refers to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"SEERAD and its family of agencies\"</p><p>being deployed to help all aspects of countryside life. Some might say that that is the family from hell. Far too many real families have been forced to leave the land in search of work. The acid test for the programme will be whether that trend can be reversed. SEERAD and its quasi-autonomous children have yet to prove themselves to be real supporters of the countryside.</p><p>It is good to see that standard payments will be laid out for standard capital items at an early stage. I hope that all the supportive material will be in place in good time for land managers to formulate their claims. Far too often in schemes such as this we find that the closing date for applications precedes the time when the detail of the payments is laid out for people, which causes considerable problems.</p><p>As a representative of the Highlands and Islands, I am acutely aware of the need for community rights to make decisions as well as for plans to develop the best way forward. The LEADER programme, of course, helps people to think in terms of communities, but I hope that the Government will embrace the idea that it must try to help people do that. Although there is great commitment to community planning, there is not much commitment to enable people to take more decisions at the most local level.</p><p>In addition, there has been far too much evidence in recent consultations of ministers' ignoring much of the evidence that consultees produce. Two consultations that affected my area were on the bull-hire scheme and the crofting reform process. If people do not answer the questions that ministers ask, what they say is ignored, but some of the wisest remarks about the future are in comments that are triggered by the questions that ministers ask, but which do not necessarily answer ministers' questions. The result of the consultation will depend on how closed ministers' approach to the consultation document will be, and how open they will be to suggestions.</p><p>If the 2007 to 2013 Scottish rural development programme is to be effective and cutting edge, deskbound civil servants must listen to the practitioners and think carefully about real life in the countryside. The Environment and Rural Development Committee took evidence in Stornoway last Monday on the Crofting Reform etc Bill and afterwards I was presented, by a local consultant, with a recently written paper on lamb marketing for sustainable futures in the outer Hebrides. The stark truth is that all the current subsidies under the common agricultural policy <place-holder colnum=\"25008\"/> contributed to a gross margin for flocks in Lewis of just 53p per breeding ewe in 2004. Fixed costs would need to be allocated before the true profit&#8212;or, in this case, loss&#8212;could be calculated. The fragility of our countryside is illustrated by that perhaps extreme example for people who come from leafier areas.</p><p>The proof of the success of the rural development programme will be in whether it encourages of producers and land managers in all the varied Scottish circumstances to combat the deeply unprofitable agricultural times in which we live with a new set of supports that are vital to keeping rural populations buoyant and, as I said at the start, which dare to increase the numbers who earn their living from our land.</p>", "hdate": "2006-04-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13360217", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rural Development Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The minister may be chuffed by the evidence that he has just led, but we must consider the programme in total.

Although the process seeks to make safe and remove nuclear material, almost every month there have been reports of small radiation leaks, occasionally affecting one or two people. Given that 450 such plants are still being used to produce nuclear power, the potential for accidents to happen remains considerable. Our world has still not made up its mind to stop the use of this process once and for all, and we remember Chernobyl not just because of the accident there but because people are still prepared to put so many parts of the world in similar danger.</p><p>Plenty of evidence shows that the operation of nuclear power stations is reasonably safe. However, no one has properly worked out the real costs of setting up, running and decommissioning plants and safely storing the results of the process. The fact that the problem is so great is something that is hidden from the population in an attempt to suggest that, somehow or other, nuclear power can be a short-term solution to sorting out the problems of energy gaps. That debate has to be conducted in the most serious fashion.</p><p>Over the years, I have met many of the groups who have come to the Highlands to provide respite for children affected by the Chernobyl disaster. I consider that a small part of the job that we could do in a place that was touched only lightly by the disaster, but touched directly nonetheless. During that weekend, when the rain fell, my family was walking on the beach at Gairloch. They thought that that was better than being in the house that they were visiting, which had had wood preservative treatment and smelled pretty awful. They did not realise what they were experiencing on the beach in the rain in Gairloch. That echoes the stories that many other people tell of the effects on them of Chernobyl.</p><p>Our Governments were not equipped to deal easily with the problem. The minister in the Scottish Office, the late John Mackay MP, suggested that the effect on some of us would be like the effect of one chest X-ray. The level of knowledge that existed in Governments and the advice that was given to people at the time were totally inadequate. I wonder whether, despite all the calculations that are done in this day and age, we are any better prepared for an accident of that size. I suggest that we try to draw the people and Government of Ukraine into a wider fellowship in the European Community, to tackle the problem and to set an example to the world.

The Environment and Rural Development Committee, of which I am a member, deals constantly with measures that have been handed down from Europe. The message that must go out is that many European directives are good for the services that are provided in Scotland. For example, the directives on water and sewerage have raised service standards a great deal. However, we could argue about many matters. In agriculture, it is of course welcome that, finally and after many years, the beef ban has been lifted; the Scottish National Party welcomes that very much. However, we believe that, if Scotland had been represented directly in the discussions on that matter, the time that was taken to lift the ban might have been a good deal shorter.</p><p>I will mention two issues that are of interest in relation to the way in which we influence the EU. The first is about the difficulties that producers in our islands and remote areas&#8212;the less favoured areas of agricultural production&#8212;face. I have questioned ministers at every opportunity to try to find out how Europe will deal with the varying problems that it faces, while meeting its particular interests. In January, at the start of the Austrian presidency of the EU, I asked Ross Finnie about that. Austria is a mountainous place. Our cold and wet islands are not unique to us and other countries have hot and dry islands. Other places have short growing seasons and others are windy and rainy. All those areas are less favoured in a particular way.</p><p>It is important that we press the EU to come up speedily with a definition of the term \"less favoured area\" that takes on board all those aspects. Until we do that, it will be up to individual nations to interpret the term. It is of considerable concern to me that the way in which the Labour and Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive has interpreted the term allows far higher payments for producers in places such as East Lothian and Aberdeenshire than it allows for those in the Western Isles, the northern isles and the north mainland. It is essential that we get a definition of less favoured area that takes into account remoteness, peripherality, low productivity and additional costs of production. We must develop a definition in this <place-holder colnum=\"24713\"/> country that can be accepted in Europe and which actually supports the least favoured areas.</p><p>So far, we have not succeeded in doing that. Ross Finnie has said that Europe has great difficulty in working out how to deal with the matter. As other countries in Europe have experience of the less favoured area support scheme, the Executive should learn from some of that experience and apply it in this country, to benefit those who have the least favourable conditions. Continental Europe is Scotland's friend. It has many of the problems that we face. It would be a good idea if the Executive, rather than say that it is difficult for Europe to make definitions, were to build on the potential of other people's experience to ensure that we get the best deal for our least favoured areas.</p><p>The second issue is the way in which the behaviour of the European Union impinges on the world stage. I was glad that, in the middle of 2005, EU environment ministers rebuffed the European Commission in its attempt to get genetically modified crops accepted and to stop the ban on GM maize. The environment ministers reflect the views of most consumers in Europe. There is vast public pressure behind a ban on GM crops because the public are less keen on GM crops than are some farmers. Given its relationship with the rest of the world and with the World Trade Organisation, and the pressure from large producers such as the USA, Argentina and Canada, who want to sell GM crops around the world and for such crops to spread unhindered, the Parliament has a major role, though its committees and through the Executive, to ensure that the Commission is in no doubt that consumers in this country and in many other countries reject that direction. The environment ministers have our support in ensuring that that view is made plain. The Commission had better listen to the people who are elected from each country to take such decisions. It is of considerable concern that the WTO, which is a very undemocratic body, should have that kind of influence.</p><p>There are many other issues. Charlie Gordon mentioned public services. That is an area of concern, because any free-market set-up in public services would be detrimental to particular areas of Scotland.</p><p>As a whole, the EU has the SNP's support, but it is essential that the Parliament makes the most of its present influence. There are many issues that we could cover in that respect, but I wanted to draw those two matters to the attention of the minister and the committee. We must ensure that we keep a close eye on the way in which those aspects of our environment are dealt with. We are much more than an economic, free-trading area. Many of the less favoured areas of Europe&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"24714\"/> whether they are industrial, post-industrial or very rural&#8212;hope to see the EU perform its social responsibility. It is essential that the Parliament's influence is felt in the decisions that are taken by the Council of Ministers and the Commission. I commend the report to the Parliament.

The pattern that is emerging is consistent, whether one hears the account from customers or from staff. When pension books were abolished, business at sub-post offices dropped by some two thirds; pensioners stopped using their post office. In time, pensioners got used to using their card accounts, but this system is now also under threat of abolition, in 2010. The authorities could not have done more to undermine people's confidence in their ability to access payments through their local post offices.</p><p>Of course, more categories of allowance could be paid through the Post Office card account system. For example, I understand that local housing allowances and educational maintenance allowances could be paid in this way. Why has the Government not implemented that? If that were to happen, the POCA system could become very viable.</p><p>Richard Lochhead and David Davidson outlined the difficulties that are inherent in setting up a POCA. Constituents and friends have had the greatest of difficulties in that regard; dozens of <place-holder colnum=\"24674\"/> letters flew back and forth before their accounts were finally set up. It seems almost as if the Government has a deliberate policy of putting people off these accounts.</p><p>The friends in question live in the village of Rosehall in Sutherland. If there was a reduction in its business, the post office in the village would close, as would the local shop, which is attached to it. If that were to happen, pensioners and benefit claimants in Rosehall would have to travel nine miles to the bank in Lairg or 13 miles to Ardgye to use a cashline machine. As Richard Lochhead said, they would also have to pay &#163;1.75 to access their money. That would be ridiculous.</p><p>Sparsely populated areas are put under double pressure, and poorer people on low incomes who try to use their local post offices, which are part of the social fabric, are being dissuaded from doing so. People in the north face surcharges from private carriers to bring goods to the north, and post offices are being cherry picked because of the way in which privatisation is being brought in. We are seeing yet another nail being driven into the heart of the system, and it is essential that we get cross-party support in Scotland and that we look to the minister to tell us exactly how she is going to deal with the Department for Work and Pensions to represent the views expressed by what I hope is the united voice of people here.</p><p>It is not too late.

Policy support documents contain solutions to problems, not just aspirations. As far as I can see, the country's hopes and wishes can be met if we travel in the direction in which the minister wants us to go, but if we are to make any progress, the Executive's approach to agriculture must have a higher profile that is reflected in ministerial activity. <place-holder colnum=\"23938\"/></p><p>It should be the role of the Minister for Environment and Rural Development not to congratulate farmers and crofters on keeping going, but to put in place the supports that the farming industry needs so that it can make advances.</p><p>I am concerned that the strategy contains little discussion of how we can increase the amount of co-operation. At present, the Government gives about &#163;300,000 to support the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society; in contrast, the Scottish Agricultural College gets around &#163;17 million of support. There are lessons that we can learn from abroad. Farmers in Denmark, France and New Zealand cope with modern market conditions better than our farmers do because they get major Government support to create co-operatives. In the United States of America, farmers are given significant assistance to become more market oriented and are educated in how co-operatives work and can help them. There is no sign of the provision of such help in the strategy and I do not think that the detail will come along.</p><p>I am worried about the fact that a consultation will soon be held on separation distances between genetically modified crops and conventional or organic crops. The danger is that the commercial or commodity end of agriculture is being favoured over the needs and wishes of consumers.</p><p>It seems that Sarah Boyack did not pick up on some of the important points that Richard Lochhead made at the beginning of his speech about the benefits to the consumer that a stronger farming sector would bring. If she had listened, she would have realised that the Scottish National Party's interest is to ensure that a farming strategy serves local consumers&#8212;for example, by strengthening local markets. We expect the minister to take cognisance of the barriers to stronger local markets for food. Public policy should provide far more specific signals, help and incentives to meet local demand than it does at present. We need to aim produce at local markets to a greater extent. There is a need for more local processing facilities&#8212;local abattoirs were mentioned in another debate. Economies of scale hamper small producers. The expense of entering the supply chain for supermarkets does not benefit small producers, yet such producers are an essential part of what we are trying to achieve in Scotland.</p><p>A sustainable food and drink strategy for Scotland would be one that allows producers on family farms and small farms to take part in the process and not to be cut out. It is smaller farms that are threatened by commercial farming. Talking of small farms, Alasdair Morrison mentioned the Crofting Reform etc Bill. Let us remember that the bill will deal with how crofts are <place-holder colnum=\"23939\"/> organised. It will not deal with the problems that crofters face with transport, with getting winter feed at reasonable prices or with exporting their crops. It will not deal with planning issues and many other matters that crofters, like farmers, require to help them to diversify. Alasdair Morrison may criticise the bill for the danger that it might create a free market in croft tenancies, but it is high time that those who voice such criticism came up with an amendment to prevent that. Instead, we get rhetoric from some sections of the Labour Party in the Highlands against the ministers on the front bench. That division in the Labour Party is extremely marked.</p><p>There has been quite a bit of discussion about biodiesel and biomass. I reiterate the SNP's view that there is a lot of set-aside land&#8212;and a lot of agricultural land&#8212;in the north-east of Scotland, where we could be growing a lot more. As Richard Lochhead pointed out, if we covered all the set-aside in Scotland with oil-seed rape, we could produce enough biodiesel to fuel about 2 million cars. Nobody wants that to happen, but the industry is hindered at the base by the fact that there is no crusher plant in Scotland for oil-seed rape. That is the kind of support that the minister could give.</p><p>There should be much more advocacy from the UK Government, which could try to show how Brazilian beef, for example, gets to Scotland without any scrutiny of its origins. The Amazon rainforest is being cut down to create cattle farms in Brazil, but none of that is taken into account in the way in which the World Trade Organisation considers free trade in agriculture. One of the SNP's major concerns is that standards in agriculture should favour Scottish local producers and not the free market, which allows people to have lower standards. It is up to our Government to ensure that that happens.</p><p>Getting young entrants into farming has been discussed by one or two members. If we are going to bring down the average age of farmers and follow the lines of a loan subsidy, we should perhaps consider an all-age subsidy for farming. We have to think about how retirement fits in and about training. We have to get support from the Government to encourage farmers to come into the industry. The SNP's criticisms are an attempt to firm up the policy; indeed our amendment says so. I commend our amendment to the chamber.

As a result, Professor Alexander decided to fall on his sword. Scottish Water domestic and business customers across the country are entitled to ask what will happen next and what will become of the Government's promises to deliver.</p><p>On 1 December, the First Minister said to John Swinney:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We gave a commitment last year to review the strategic objectives of Scottish Water and the long-term investment plans, and we have done that.

Ample evidence shows that impatience in the Scottish Executive was forcing the pace. Rhona Brankin's letter of 1 February to each regulator reminded them that they all had to agree that the delivery plan should begin, as that would</p><p class=\"indent\">\"provide a clear means of measuring progress towards delivery of all the objectives.\"</p><p>Each regulator seemed to be working closely with Scottish Water. That was underscored by Colin McLaren, the drinking water quality regulator, who told Ms Brankin on 6 February:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I had not seen SW's Delivery plan prior to its submission to the Executive on 30th January, although I have worked closely with Scottish water in recent weeks to agree exactly what needs to be delivered to meet the Minister's drinking water quality objectives.\"</p><p>Sir Ian Byatt's team also appeared to be working closely with Scottish Water personnel, but he found fault with Scottish Water's new plan. On 7 Feb, he noted:<place-holder colnum=\"23706\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"In a number of material elements the Delivery Plan fails\".</p><p>He reflected the minister's impatience, saying that he was pleased that Mr Finnie's official would chair the proposed high-level group that was \"planning an early meeting\". He also caught the ministerial mood by noting that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we were not encouraged by the tone of the document\".</p><p>Was that, perhaps, to break the logjam? He also said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to ensure that your objectives are met it is essential to define and report on regular (measurable) milestones\".</p><p>Unfortunately, bungling by officials in the Environment and Rural Affairs Department misled the regulators, who were asked to comment on an older draft of the new delivery plan than the one that was delivered to ministers. The waters were muddied while each party set to rights the actual position. I ask the minister whether that was deliberate.</p><p>Despite the previous close working between the regulators and Scottish Water, ministerial stewardship began to look a bit shaky. At that point, Mr Finnie brought the crisis to a head. Professor Alexander's rebuttal letter expressed surprise about many of the regulators' comments. Was the minister beginning to see problems with the delivery of the quality and standards II outcomes for 2002 to 2006 overlapping with the start date of Q and S III in April? Was the conclusion of Q and S III slipping beyond the 2010 completion date? Was the very structure that was forcing customers to pay around 80p in the pound for capital developments creating a new water tax, as commentators have alleged? Further, is the minister siphoning off borrowing consent from Scottish Water for other Scottish Executive purposes, thus adding to the crisis of delivery in relation to Q and S III?</p><p>Comments about the impact of delays in development constraints rain in from housing and business developers who are sick, tired and fed up of getting no definite dates for water infrastructure new starts. Given the small sums that were allocated by ministers to remove development constraints in the overall package, was Scottish Water fully to blame?</p><p>It is incumbent on ministers to set out how they will handle the sign-off of the 2006 to 2010 delivery plan. It is essential that customers get a clear picture of what will achieve ministerial objectives and what effects the current delay in agreeing them will have on the whole programme.</p><p>On 1 December, the First Minister said to John Swinney:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Water Industry Commission for Scotland has made it clear in its expert analysis that Scottish Water can deliver <place-holder colnum=\"23707\"/> all the objectives with less-than-real-terms increases in water consumer charges in Scotland over the next few years ... If the constraints and development plans change over time, the objectives will be reviewed.

It cannot be put any clearer than the First Minister put it then. Things were on track on 1 December. In mid-February, after Scottish Water submitted its new delivery plan, we were still told that Alan Alexander believed it</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to be wholly compliant with the Ministerial requirements\".</p><p>By early February, while regulators such as the drinking water quality regulator were continuing to work with Scottish Water to achieve ministerial objectives by 2010, Ross Finnie had decided that the uncertainties raised by Scottish Water's rebuttals were the last thing he wanted to hear. They opened up too many assessments of risks and unforeseen realities, and questioned the &#163;2.1 billion cap with a &#163;50 million contingency that could still make the ministerial objectives go west.</p><p>In the <em>Sunday Herald</em> on 26 February, Alf Young noted that he was told by one Executive source:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we don't mean it's a matter for negotiation.\"</p><p>Scottish Water was told that it had to deliver quickly, but we do not know how.</p><p>My colleagues will explore in detail the Executive's flawed water delivery model and poor stewardship.

[<em>Interruption.</em>] I am glad that members from other parties realise that I am about to suggest that we consider the north of Norway. It is instructive that the service there is better manned, that it has a larger number of aircraft and that how it is organised causes less concern. At least, that was the situation on my visit to a medical conference in Norway last September and that was the kind of information that I was seeking. We should compare what we have with what other countries have, because the new contract gives us less than we had when I was writing my motion, more than a year ago.</p><p>Part of the problem with creating a dedicated service is that some of the contract relies on coastguard aircraft being available in emergencies. However, coastguard aircraft might not be available in precisely the kind of weather that we have been talking about, so how can we arrange the service to have fewer aircraft and be more reliant than before on the availability of coastguard aircraft? Fewer aircraft will not do. The idea that the aircraft could be based in Inverness and that it could be icy there, but not in Orkney or Barra, is another issue. If we are dealing with emergencies that are mainly in the islands&#8212;we can show from the figures that we are&#8212;we must rethink. I ask the minister to address that point. Scotland requires greater investment in appropriate aircraft, more of which should be based in the places that are most affected by severe weather.

As we indicate at the end of our amendment, we feel that patients' rights must be taken on board thoroughly and quickly. Our policy proposal to provide every patient with an individual waiting time guarantee, appropriate to them, within national waiting time targets, gets to the heart of the issues that have been raised. It is interesting that Jamie Stone and others have talked about waiting times in some of the more diverse parts of the country. We can congratulate ourselves on the general improvement in waiting times, but averages can be skewed enormously by the problems that people have in smaller health boards. It is on that area that I wish to spend a little time.</p><p>Key diagnostic tests are increasingly available and, as Euan Robson suggested, an ideal time of no more than about nine weeks is essential for such tests. Jamie Stone raised the case of the gentleman who was waiting for an MRI scan. If such a patient had waited six or seven months, only to be told that he would have to wait another nine months because of a recruitment problem, one has to ask how many places there are in Scotland where recruitment problems are one of the issues that affect waiting times. How many of the smaller boards that have a shortage of consultants and so on are affected by the problem even more than central Scotland is affected? That question bothers me considerably. When we are approached by constituents about such problems, we have to say, \"You don't deserve to be treated any worse than people in larger communities.\" The <place-holder colnum=\"23546\"/> problems of smaller communities, where there are large distances to travel, must be solved.</p><p>As many members have stated, waiting times are affected by the increasing aging population and the need for a good deal wider range of treatments than we have had in the past. However, they are also affected by the way in which health boards and health services have been reorganised almost every two years. Reorganisation affects staff morale, which affects how waiting times are dealt with.</p><p>Let us consider the 2004 figures for staff increases. The biggest increase of all&#8212;about 19 per cent since 1999&#8212;was in scientific and technical staff. Administrative staff and estate staff increased by 12 per cent, nurses and midwives by 5 per cent and general practitioners by 2.3 per cent. That demonstrates that, because of the way in which the NHS is now organised, there are more organisers than front-line staff. That suggests to me that the structures that we now have are not the best for morale or the best way in which to organise nursing.</p><p>The Arbuthnott cash settlements for various health boards were said to benefit those areas in most need. It was interesting that, when the First Minister visited the Western Isles last week, he said that there would be a huge increase in money for Western Isles NHS Board, but it turned out to be 6.7 per cent. That is lower than the increase for Highland NHS Board, which was more than 8 per cent&#8212;I think that it was 8.9 per cent, in fact. It is strange to me that Arbuthnott was unable to deal with the great problems of remoteness in areas in which there are increases in waiting time differentials.</p><p>Because this speech is short, I cannot go into more detail. I return to information. What would help us most is to ensure that information on MRI scans, for example, is available throughout the country. Certain health boards in the central belt can provide such information but, when NHS Highland was asked about its MRI scan record, it said that the information was too expensive to collect.

The potential arrival of avian flu in Scotland is one of the most serious issues that Parliament will have to face. I spoke to John Scott&#8212;long before I was elected&#8212;in the days following the announcements about BSE, when I was the SNP spokesman on agricultural matters. Many people had theories about the multifactoral nature of the disease, which suggests that it takes time to establish what the problem is and to find solutions to it. Every rural development minister has to cope with that issue.</p><p>As the avian flu situation develops, we will ask the minister to address many different needs. The bill sets out opportunities for us to examine how we will deal with planning and pre-planning. I very much welcome the documents that have been circulated concerning \"Scotland's Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease Contingency Plan\". However, I am concerned that the effects on areas of the country in which migratory birds arrive, of which there are many&#8212;the coasts and firths near where people stay, as Maureen Macmillan mentioned&#8212;might be greater than on city populations that have less contact with wild birds. The contingency plan should take into account the needs of people who live in such areas.</p><p>During the current avian flu outbreak, we must take seriously our duty of care for wild birds. According to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Governments in south-east Asia have responded to some extent to the potential for wild bird culls, despite clear advice from the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health&#8212;the OIE&#8212;that control of the H5N1 virus by culling wild birds is not feasible and should not be attempted because it may accelerate the spread of the virus.

There is no exact science&#8212;we develop science as we go along. However, it is important for members of the Environment and Rural Development Committee to have a clearer signal from the minister about how he will approach mass slaughter: members from all parties are seeking such definition.</p><p>The minister has said that he will, from the start of any fast-moving disease outbreak and on a continuing basis, keep Parliament informed of the actions that the Executive will take at key stages and decision-making times. That suggests that an effort will be made to tell Parliament what has happened, rather than to involve it in what might be done. If we are to have confidence in how the minister's machinery works and if the public are to support the powers that he seeks, which are very wide, a good deal of transparency will be required.</p><p>As members have said, attitudes to animal welfare have changed. The general population is a good deal more aware that working animals and farm animals, as well as wild animals and pets, deserve decent treatment in our country. For that reason, I must comment on the debate about the way in which veterinary opinion is formed. We cannot talk about vets' having a different attitude to animal welfare in rural situations from their general attitude, although of course many vets deal only with companion animals. We disagree totally with Ted Brocklebank and the Tories that the veterinary profession as a whole does not understand the issues relating to working dogs.</p><p>In order to define the situation, we have to take as much evidence as possible. I have notes from a vet who asked me before today's debate why owners of working cocker or springer spaniels feel that their dogs will receive tail injuries while working when other working dogs, such as Labradors, retrievers, setters and an even greater number of sheepdogs do not get tail injuries.

The difference in the cost of the proposals is not that great&#8212;it will not cost anything like 30 times more to put the line under the sea. All the issues must be examined in the context of a public inquiry. There is no way that the health issues or the route issues can possibly be decided unless the Scottish Executive takes on board the fact that an undersea cable would be a way of simultaneously opening up the possibilities that are created by our new forms of infinite power supply and protecting the people who live in the areas through which the lines that would otherwise carry that power to the places where it will be used would be situated.

In the main, the funding for renewables seems to be coming from the private purse, albeit with some Government subsidy.</p><p>The fact that a huge amount was spent on developing the nuclear industry in the past distorts the debate.

The problem that the Tories have is that they consider the British context, in which large centres of population can be served by large units. In Scotland, we have a much more dispersed population. We need to consider the process of serving that population and accessing the wider market for what we can produce from clean sources.

Until we have power over energy policy in Scotland, we are not going to get the Government backing that is required to put the renewables sector on a much firmer footing.</p><p>Nora Radcliffe mentioned energy efficiency. How much carbon would be saved by investing &#163;X million in energy efficiency, rather than in a new nuclear power station? Energy experts estimate that seven times as much carbon would be saved, reducing the requirement for the power to be produced.

Offshore wind is much more predictable than the Tories admit. Companies such as Talisman, which is prepared to invest something in the region of &#163;1 billion in the Moray firth Beatrice scheme, do not throw their money around lightly. They see offshore energy as part of an energy mix. That mix has to include biomass, which we can develop here, and other energy sources.</p><p>The issue of access through the grid to a market for that energy affects any kind of production.

Indeed, the situation is similar to the difference between the rail journey that we were on and commuting by car. We have to sell the message that sustainability can make life easier for people if they engage in the process. If people throughout the country help to maximise sustainability, that will bring about a dynamic and sustainable Scotland that can brim with green jobs and healthy communities.

Looking at the outcome of January's fisheries council, could we say that the present negotiation mechanism is the best way to deal with the future of Scotland's fishing industry? Could Scotland's stocks and fishing effort be improved if we were directly represented in Europe? Of course it could. The fisheries council is the minister's focus in this debate, but members have been looking at the fishing industry in general and at what happens between council meetings.</p><p>It is important to note that there may have been developments that might aid the fishing industry and the stocks. Beginning with Ted Brocklebank, several members have discussed the regional advisory council system. That is developing too slowly&#8212;it is only an advisory body. It is interesting that Alasdair Morrison, who appears to have left, mentioned Scottish inshore fishery advisory <place-holder colnum=\"21412\"/> groups, the first two of which will be set up in Berwickshire and the Western Isles in spring next year. We welcome that, and particularly what the minister said about them. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Local fishermen will now have more power to plan for and react to local circumstances and to develop new planning measures that suit their geographical conditions and the needs of their fisheries.\"</p><p>If the inshore fisheries group can do that, why can we not have a convention for the future of Scotland's fishing communities? A Scottish fishing council comprising industry representatives could be established to discuss the issues locally and Scotland-wide each year. That SNP proposal would add to the logic of what the minister said about the inshore groups.</p><p>Discussion on scallops and several other stocks highlighted the problem with inshore and deeper-sea fishing. There are boats that can fish both. The idea of an overall Scottish policy in a convention for the future of Scotland's fishing communities can bring those two major sectors together. It is important that we make progress on that.</p><p>Although the Shetland box is not up for negotiation, it is important for many of us. It may not be the best conservation measure, but scientists are clear that retention is better than abolition. As far as I can see, our ministers will be debating such matters in Europe in the near future and it is important to state that the SNP believes in the retention, not the abolition, of the Shetland box. It is important that the minister gives us his views about that.</p><p>My colleague Richard Lochhead talked about the need to have active fishermen and coastal communities with the ability to catch. It cannot be the case that the current form of organisation can continue for much longer; too many people sit with their baffies on deciding what places should get the licences and where fishing should take place. That cannot be a good way of running any industry and I would like to see some progress.</p><p>We are glad that there is a degree of stability in haddock stocks and we hope that the minister will maintain our ability to catch haddock. However, there is conflicting advice on climate change. An article in <em>The Times</em> today reflects the current debate. Recent information has suggested that cod have been migrating further north because the seas are cooler there. However, future climate change could lead to a far colder area because of the north Atlantic drift and the weakening of the gulf stream. It could be that, in five or 10 years' time, we learn that it is not overfishing but climate change that is playing the major part in the reduction of stocks. Does the minister have any clear idea on the effects of climate change on the present settlements?<place-holder colnum=\"21413\"/></p><p>In the international agreements, it is interesting to consider one of the deep-sea species that is still in reasonable supply&#8212;although that comment is slightly qualified in the ICES report. ICES will advise that the current fishing pressure on blue whiting is too high and has to be reduced in line with the long-term management plan that was agreed for the stock by the EU, the Faroes, Iceland and Norway in 2002. There is no reason why Scotland, as one of the major catching countries, could not be directly involved in those kinds of negotiation. The fact that negotiation can involve several countries that are not in the EU suggests that Scotland should be at the top table.</p><p>The SNP raises the issue of the CFP in its amendment to the motion.

The Vertex centre has allowed people to do work that will fit around a family. That is excellent when it is possible.</p><p>The call centre in Brora deals with health questions and Highland Council's call centre, which has opened at Alness Point, deals with questions about Highland Council's services. The latter has a public sector requirement and has a strong future. However, the commercial heart of the Vertex operation ought to be thriving. More people are using trains, and more people in different companies are using trains.

It is entirely possible that a high degree of pressure could be put on Virgin to get it to rethink its decision.</p><p>Vertex says that it is chasing work, so I wonder why it did not chase the work from First ScotRail a few months ago. I am pleased that there is now a call centre in Fort William, but I wondered at the time whether Vertex might not have been chasing that work and whatever other work it could get from other firms that might want to provide train timetables.</p><p>In any case, the arguments are clear.

We see good prospects in exporting energy from clean renewables from Scotland to England. As we said then, we must first decide what can be produced here so that local and national needs are met first. We have to ensure that we bring energy from micro-renewables and the micro-heat process into the frame at an early stage. The kinds of incentives that are needed to do that take second place.</p><p>In the Shetlands on Unst&#8212;the most northerly island in Scotland&#8212;PURE Energy Ltd is working on hydrogen cell technology. It is also engaged in changing people's behaviour; that change is most important. The project has involved the creation of an energy audit for the people on Unst in respect of how they use their cars, how they heat and save energy in their homes and how they work. Unst has a small population, so it may eventually be possible for the island to be totally powered by renewables. The island of Stronsay in the Orkneys is seeking to do the same thing through a combination of hydrogen cell power and small windmills.</p><p>If those communities can conduct an energy audit that changes people's behaviour, every community from the north to the south of Scotland and from the cities to the furthest clachan in the countryside must do the same. Within the process of encouraging use of many forms of heat and power generation, we must get people on board in areas that they recognise&#8212;in wards, parishes or whatever. That part of the process will kick-start change. There is plenty of information about individual places. Different communities have capacities to create different kinds of energy.

A vast amount of cooking oil is used in the cities compared with a <place-holder colnum=\"21048\"/> small community such as Kirkwall. That suggests to me that, for such activity to take place, it must be organised on the basis of an energy audit. Unless we have such audits, all the great ideas that have been discussed will not be brought to fruition as quickly as they should be and the micro and small-scale renewables projects that we all want will stall, because the Government does not see them as part of an overall energy strategy that includes having every community do an energy audit now.</p>", "hdate": "2005-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13350323", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Micro-renewables Technologies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Sarah Boyack on securing the debate.

The Parliament's problem is that our ambition to include back benchers in debates and to allow them to create law should be increasing, not reducing. As my colleague Alasdair Morgan said, we face the problem of dealing with the situation pro tem. People will lose out in the 18 months until the next election. Some people's bills might well be more complex than others that have been adopted, but they might be more important. The problem of weighing up such matters has not been resolved. The problem for debate is that we need agreement on how to resolve the complexities.</p><p>As I am one of the people who have been in the middle of work on the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine Railway and Linked Improvements Bill and the Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Bill, I know how much of NEBU's resource private bills have taken up. The Government has proposed to change the private bill procedure to that which is followed at Westminster under the Transport and Works Act 1992. I hope and understand that that will free up some NEBU support to back benchers but, at present, NEBU does not have enough people to support all the proposed bills. In addition, we do not have enough time in Parliament to deal with the bills. We do not meet often enough or have enough committees or staff for them.</p><p>The last thing that we want is to say that Scotland needs more legislators, more parliamentary staff and more civil servants, but the logic of the debate is that that is true. If we want to catch up and to do the business that the Parliament hopes to conduct to influence the life of Scotland, such issues must be taken on board. Duncan McNeil's proposals show that in a microcosm.</p><p>I support Alasdair Morgan's comment that we must agree on how to proceed. I will reflect on a proposal that I lodged a year or so ago for a bill on the succession to land. I had to await publication of the Government's Family Law (Scotland) Bill to find out whether that bill would cover the aspect of family law that my proposed bill dealt with. That meant that if my proposal was to be considered, it would be dealt with late in the parliamentary session. As Brian Monteith said, when issues are time sensitive because they relate to an event that will happen soon&#8212;as in his case&#8212;or when they cannot be dealt with until later in the session&#8212;as in my case&#8212;the problem is that the current <place-holder colnum=\"19965\"/> procedure puts people at a great disadvantage in having those proposals taken seriously. That must be dealt with. Urgent matters come up, but there are also issues on which it is necessary to await what the Government does. In this case the Executive's bill did not deal with the matter that I am concerned about&#8212;the succession to land.</p><p>I will deal with the issue of size, complexity and scope. It is true that if members were trying to weigh matters up in relation to the number of staff that we have, they might decide that it is more important to have a GM bill than one for tartan registration. It might be much easier to pass the tartan registration bill, but is it needed in a hurry? My question is: can we rely on the SPCB to make decisions for the whole of the Parliament that allow such priorities to be taken on board? Somewhere in the back of my mind I believe that there is fair play; but on the other hand, I sometimes wonder.</p><p>Alasdair Morgan spoke about the mechanism for competence. The crux of the debate is whether we can agree on that. Since we are only learning how to go about the business of back-benchers' legislation and so on, I guess that it will take some time to work out. In six years we have tried to create a mechanism that allows many more members than almost any other Parliament to bring legislation forward from the back benches. That is important for the Parliament because it suggests that we are sensitive to the potential for legislation from the back benches. We should welcome that, laud it and be thankful that it has been possible to fit those bills in.</p><p>If we cannot find a way to get more staff for NEBU and more time for debates on such legislation it will be almost impossible for more back-bench bills to be brought forward. The Parliament must face up to that. I hope that the debate leads to a decision. The pro tem approach recommended by the SPCB's report is welcome, but it is not the end of the story.</p>", "hdate": "2005-10-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13347415", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Non-Executive Bills Unit (Prioritisation of Workload)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Okay&#8212;very good.

It is essential to say that the current proposals will not improve people's rights or restore their faith in the planning system.<place-holder colnum=\"19732\"/></p><p>Community participation will be the crunch aspect of the bill. Authorities are often a great distance from the places that their decisions will affect. We need a robust and consistent planning framework to back whichever level is chosen for planning decisions.</p><p>We would like to hear from the ministers whether strategic environmental assessment and wide public consultation will take place when a system such as the national planning framework is established, because many policies&#8212;not least that on nuclear power station development, which my colleagues have mentioned&#8212;need to be very clear.</p><p>Local planning authorities cannot deal with many pressing issues because they do not have the back-up of a strategy. We have heard about the lack of a strategy for wind farms, which Margaret Jamieson mentioned just before I spoke. Local decisions must be consistent. The behaviour of people such as landowners and crofters in my area can greatly affect the potential for affordable housing to be built, but how does the planning system apply to that? Can it free up land for housing? That question is asked time and again.</p><p>When I asked ministers about that and about using compulsory purchase as a short-term means to access such land, I was told that the Executive had no intention of conducting a study of how compulsory purchase works or how it could be improved or speeded up. Furthermore, I was told that any compulsory purchase that has taken place for affordable housing could not be specified, because the facts were not available to the civil service. Such items are the tools for making a national planning framework work and providing back-up at the local level. If the tools are not available, the job cannot be done.</p><p>We face an argument about where decisions are taken. Through the Environment and Rural Development Committee, I have been involved in discussions about climate change and the development of accessible rural areas. In those discussions, the question continually arises of involving people from families to communities and on to the national level to take action. What planning law attempts to bring decisions closer to people, rather than to provide for participation or planning in the community?</p><p>Community councils are basic organisations for democracy that are badly underused. As other members have said, they are badly resourced. Is it not time to consider giving community councils greater powers in the planning bill to deal with basic down-to-earth matters? They often represent between 1,000 and 5,000 people, depending on where they are. In other countries, such as Norway, municipalities have such powers. I see the Minister for Communities smile again. <place-holder colnum=\"19733\"/></p><p>Planning decisions can be taken far more locally in countries that are of a comparable size to our country. An answer is required from the minister about whether that is possible here.</p><p>Engaging people in the process is fundamental.

If such agencies were involved in the process of drawing up local plans&#8212;I would welcome those plans being drawn up on a five-yearly basis&#8212;people would have much more engagement with them and would see them as part of the support for more sustainable communities. It is necessary for the bill to make more of the potential roles of SNH and Historic Scotland in particular. Other members have discussed questions that relate to buildings, for example, which require attention in the process.</p><p>The bill is a great opportunity to extend democracy and the engagement of the population of this country not only with the 32 councils and the Executive, but at a much more local level.

This is a unique year in legislation&#8212;a year in which we are discussing a housing bill, a planning bill and a crofting bill. We have also discussed transport, which affects crofting, and I am afraid to say that we did not do that very well today. Each of those areas impinges on the others. Planning law changes need to be made. Planning law must begin to deal with the land that is in crofting townships and with the way in which common grazings are used. If there is a need to get land for housing, it must not come out of land for agricultural use but from the inby land. However, unless local plans start to reflect that, we will not be in a position to do anything about the demand for housing in many crofting areas, apart from within crofting families themselves.</p><p>The Housing (Scotland) Bill deals with the regulation of various aspects of private housing. We really need it to dovetail with the need to find housing in crofting areas, because the pressure is placed on the very land that we are trying to retain in crofting tenure.</p><p>When I made my submission on the draft crofting reform bill, I stated that the SNP is committed to sustainable crofting communities and that the Executive faces a challenge to make the legislation fit for 2005 and beyond. We want to have a constructive dialogue that allows the potential of each area to come to the fore. There are many abuses in the existing system, and the situation is summed up by the argument that the Crofters Commission ought to be regulating and using its powers more strongly, as John Farquhar Munro mentioned.</p><p>Who asked the civil servants to draft the bill? When we do some pre-legislative scrutiny, with members of the Environment and Rural Development Committee asking ministers what <place-holder colnum=\"19098\"/> they think about the consultation, perhaps we will begin to tease out whether there are other things that we should be doing to meet the needs that I have talked about. The subject is huge.</p><p>When Rhona Brankin told Jamie Stone in a written answer that 53 people had responded to the consultation exercise in writing, I asked her how many responded by e-mail. In fact, 55 people responded by e-mail. I thank her for giving me that answer last night. There is wide interest in the matter, and the names of the respondents who have let their names be known show us that there is an abundance of ideas. We expect ministers to analyse the responses and to put them on the net so that they are available for others to do the same.</p><p>I have taken time to discuss those matters because so many issues will come up. The extension of crofting tenure is the logical extension of what we want to do to safeguard crofting and make it sustainable. The anomalies that are thrown up by the potential to create new crofts where landlords are unwilling for that to be done and on the Isle of Arran and other places are something to which the bill will have to adjust because extending crofting outside the crofting areas was previously dismissed.</p><p>We then come to the idea of small agricultural tenants, such as the small landholders under the Small Landholders (Scotland) Act 1911, trying to use the crofting bill to find some redress for being missed out of previous landlord and tenant arrangements. We are presented with a great mix of issues.</p><p>Above all, there must be a commitment on the part of the Government to give a lead. As the landlord of many crofting estates, it could set an example to all landlords by drawing up modern maps of those estates and making another round of efforts to encourage people to become involved in the development of the estates, because so far such efforts have not worked.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13345286", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Future of Crofting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome the debate and I thank John Farquhar Munro for having secured the chance to discuss the matter.

The powers of the Scottish Executive to plan the environment are increasing and there is legislation on planning that ought to lead to a rapid updating of local plans.</p><p>Environmental and economic issues are raised by the debate. We are just about to reach stage 2 of the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Bill. A proposal by HM Government in London would not fall within the mischief&#8212;as Ross Finnie keeps calling it&#8212;of our bill, but would fall within the mischief of the UK regulations. However, a proposal for a major expansion of an airport ought to be subject to strategic environmental assessment. It will be interesting to find out whether the UK Government intends to have such an assessment and what input the Scottish Executive will have. An environmental assessment would open up the debate about the balanced use of a particular area.</p><p>On the economic front, the local plan is some years old and it is not especially clear on the implications for land use and transport in the Ingliston area. If we are to get the future right, we will have to have plans that are dynamic enough to <place-holder colnum=\"18766\"/> deal with proposals such as the expansion of Edinburgh airport. That expansion has been talked of for a considerable time, but the expansion has to be accommodated within the land concerned.</p><p>The Executive therefore has a major role to play. It is necessary to send some signals. First, the showcase for Scottish agriculture and country life cannot be placed in jeopardy. We are reducing our capacity to grow the food that we require, but that capacity will have to be increased, because the number of food miles must be reduced in future. The Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland's show highlights the potential of our farmers and crofters to achieve that for Scotland and it is important that it is held as near to the capital as possible.</p><p>We must ensure that heads are knocked together. Who is going to do that? BAA says that the discussions are finished, but someone has to hold the jackets and get the parties together. The Scottish Executive could play a major role in resolving the impasse. Examining the environmental and economic levers and planning mechanisms would be a good way of trying to bring some sense to the situation.</p><p>It is essential that our economy goes forward using the best of everything.

Does the bill meet some of the following tests?</p><p>As the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, has proposed that people with personal pension plans should be encouraged to include house purchases within their portfolios, what do Scottish ministers think will happen to desirable housing stock in attractive areas of Scotland? Although we have yet to witness the situation in which there is a &#163;1 million house in every Highland village&#8212;whether that be Evanton or Erbusaig or Locheport&#8212;every croft and former council house with a view that comes on the market will mean that house buying is denied, both now and in future, to the resident population. Those who have been alerted to the situation can already see that their children have little or no hope of competing in such a market. Young, able and willing people who want to work in the Highlands and rural areas of Scotland face a very harsh future indeed.</p><p>Like my colleague Jim Mather, who lodged questions earlier this month to probe the Government in Scotland on the matter, I want to ask what consideration the Government has given to the future availability of affordable housing in Scotland when the changes in the rules that allow self-invested pensions to invest in residential property come into force. What will be the impact on the future availability of affordable housing in Scotland? We must have answers to those questions, because the issue is fundamental to the provision of sufficient homes for people in every part of this country. Naturally, the bill does not address an issue that has arisen only since its introduction, but the chancellor's proposals will create a context in which it will be much more difficult for us to meet need.</p><p>We on the SNP benches agree that the repairing standard is a key part of the bill but, as is identified in the Environment and Rural Development Committee's climate change inquiry report&#8212;which is currently in the hands of ministers for comment&#8212;Scotland has around 700,000 homes that need to be climate proofed. The task of tackling disrepair could be a major economic driver that could create many jobs. It could cost a huge sum, which the minister suggested might be around &#163;5 billion, but does his figure include the 700,000 houses that, based on a Benfield hazard research centre estimate, the Environment and Rural Development Committee report suggested will need to be climate proofed? We need clear figures on the size and scale of the problem.</p><p>All new houses will need to be eco-friendly. Part of the reason why achieving that could be a problem was summed up in last Sunday's edition of <em>The Observer</em>. It points out:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Less than five per cent of the 170,000 to 200,000 new houses built in the UK every year, meet the 'very good' <place-holder colnum=\"18424\"/> independently audited EcoHome grading, set up by the Building Research Establishment.\"</p><p>That means that the proportion of eco-friendly houses that have been built in Scotland is very small indeed. However, now all repairs and new build will need to contribute to tackling climate change.</p><p>Climate change and sustainable economic imperatives are set to dominate policy development, so houses that are built in Scotland will need to meet the highest possible standards. As Maureen Macmillan correctly pointed out, our standards might be the highest in Britain, but they are not as high as standards in Scandinavia and are by no measure the best in Europe. Higher standards will be good for tenants and owners and for the able and disabled, so it is essential that we put in place the measures on which a sustainable economy is based.</p><p>Increased funding must be targeted at larger-scale eco-housing demonstration projects that would showcase 50 or 100 such houses in one place. We have yet to see efforts&#8212;not directly related to the bill, but forced along by it&#8212;that would allow that to happen. That is why, whenever a house is built, current storm proofing and the storm-proofing designs of the future will have to be reflected in the housing logbook, which will have to show repairs, insulation and improvements that have been made to the house throughout its life. It is necessary that the housing logbook becomes a central document that shows not only surveys but all the developments that have taken place. The bill could achieve that.</p><p>In the north, we are experiencing a sea change in attitudes. Highland Council is enthusiastic about sustainable development and has listed examples of eco-friendly buildings, to aid general understanding of the types of homes, offices and workspaces that we can expect to see in the future. To build those in remote and rural areas, the ministers with responsibility for housing and for transport will have to get together to ensure that costs for materials are slashed. We know that wooden materials are available on the mainland and that they are more highly thermally insulatable than bricks and mortar. Perhaps post-and-beam construction, rather than bricks and mortar, is the future.

While it is only 470km from Peterhead to Stavanger and 350km from Bergen to Lerwick, Berwick-upon-Tweed is 550km from the Netherlands. So it is fitting that we understand the celebrations of the centenary of Norwegian independence and encourage Scottish participation in the programme that the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has designed to enhance Norway's international visibility, update her image and celebrate her close ties with key partners, such as us Scots.</p><p>As Nikolai Skeie, a former consul in Edinburgh put it:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland and Norway have long enjoyed a close relationship with each other and our history as two small countries on the north-west fringes of Europe has much in common.\"</p><p>Those words were written in 1993, as part of the foreword to \"Norway and Scotland: a study in land use\". That eye-opening study drew many lessons from a study visit that Scots made to west Norway, when they visited islands and fjords in Hordaland and Bergen, which is Norway's second city and its oil capital. As it happens, Bergen is also the birthplace of Edvard Grieg, Norway's national composer, who had Scottish forebears and who contributed so much to Norwegian cultural confidence in the latter part of the 19th century.<place-holder colnum=\"17715\"/></p><p>In understanding the success of Norway's story we should not forget some key facts. In the 19th century, only Ireland lost a greater percentage of her people through emigration while, decade by decade, Norway and Scotland were alternately second. In 1905, an independent seat at the top table in the reparations and recovery from world war one gave neutral Norway some leverage to replace the lost tonnage in her shipping fleet. Later, further reparations followed the destructive occupation of Norway by the Nazis. However, by 1920, Norway had fewer people&#8212;2.65 million&#8212;and a lower gross domestic product than the Irish Free State did.</p><p>Norway did not lose her language and heritage in her trading relations with Britain and other partners, however. Her sea-going prowess, which was built on the technical skills that were seen in the Viking ships, remains today in her huge tanker fleet, which demonstrates Norway's flair for running shipping services both along the length of her coast and across the world's oceans.</p><p>Of particular note to Scots is the fledgling Norwegian state's historic commitment to its farmer-foresters and fisher folk that, wherever they live in a land of great travel difficulty, they have the full support of the nation to let their communities flourish. Today, great tax advantages accrue to those who live in the Arctic north, for example.</p><p>The allodial act was written into the Norwegian constitution to guarantee small land owners a locally regulated land market that was organised at county level. It also guaranteed the ownership of Norway's extensive and diverse forest resources for many of those farmers and underpinned the marketing of their produce from land and sea.</p><p>Many of the hydroelectric schemes that were built in the early 20th century produce electricity worth millions of kroner a year. Today, local communities sell their surplus production to the grid and earn a huge income from this renewable resource. The discovery of off-shore hydrocarbons in the 1970s utterly transformed Norwegian wealth. Oil and gas were developed on behalf of all Norwegians by Statoil and&#8212;with children and the future in mind&#8212;the Government created an oil fund for future generations, the Government petroleum fund. Today, through careful investment, the fund far outweighs the value of hydrocarbon production in the Norwegian sector.</p><p>Norway&#8212;this north-west peripheral maritime nation&#8212;now has the highest income per head of population of any state. Its population is increasing to a figure that approaches that of Scotland. As colleagues will mention in the debate, Norway is a major player in world affairs, not least in contributing 1 per cent of her gross domestic <place-holder colnum=\"17716\"/> product to the United Nations for the relief of poverty.</p><p>I hope that many more Scots can be encouraged to join the many celebrations in the Norway events programme. Earlier in the year, I was particularly impressed by the exhibition \"Edvard Grieg: Art and Identity\" at the City Art Centre. I am told that it will be staged again this month in Orkney under the auspices of the St Magnus festival.</p><p>Grieg and his fellow artists dug deep into Norwegian folk culture and built a modern national confidence after the country's so-called \"400 years sleep\" under Danish rule. From 1814 to 1905, when Sweden controlled Norway as joint countries under one monarch, Norwegian nation building through this cultural reawakening gave her people and politicians the courage to insist on setting up her own consulates to promote her own trade abroad. In turn, that became the tipping point towards outright Norwegian independence.</p><p>Edvard Grieg called himself a national European. He was an outward-looking Norwegian&#8212;Norwegians increasingly have become an outward-looking nation&#8212;who through his music, which was inspired by Norwegian folk art, contributed to the nation-building process. He recalled late in life:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Composers like Bach and Beethoven mastered the heights and built churches and temples. As Ibsen expressed it in his dramas, I wanted to build homes where people could feel at home and be happy.\"</p><p>Tonight's debate takes place a hundred years after the Norwegian Storting&#8212;the Parliament&#8212;resolved on 7 June 1905 to dissolve the union between Sweden and Norway. Common sense prevailed and the Swedish army stood down, and neither country has looked back since. We wish Norway well and will be glad to celebrate its brand of social democracy in a 21<sup>st</sup> century that has much need of its common purpose.</p><p>I am aware of various strands of co-operation between Scots and Norwegians, such as the north of Scotland and Sogn og Fjordane in west Norway initiative that is developing this year.

I will also make some remarks on the need to integrate community-provided transport and the regular bus services and try to tease out whether the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 had any vision for the areas that I represent.</p><p>First, there is a fundamental problem in taking individual parts of transport and thinking about the pricing systems that work for those parts. If we do not have similar pricing systems for rail and for ferries, for example, we are not providing the kind of quality transport access across an area in a fashion that makes it more possible for people to use the transport that is on offer. I make a plea for the Local Government and Transport Committee to look carefully at how pricing is carried through. Competition between bus and rail&#8212;or between bus and tram and so on, which we are talking about at the moment&#8212;does not help the process of integration. As a member of the Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Bill Committee, I will be very interested to see whether we get integration between those modes of transport. It is essential that citizens have that integration.</p><p>The coming of the new transport partnerships means that there will be quite a big imbalance in the quality of bus services between areas. For example, from evidence that was given in June last year, I note that Shetland Islands Council, Orkney Islands Council and the Western Isles Council provide 100 per cent services on a tendered basis and that Dumfries and Galloway Council provides 85 per cent of services in that way. Interestingly, Shetland Islands Council is the only council that has 100 per cent low-floor bus provision. That comes at a cost, however. When all the commercial providers in the relevant cities and areas are looked at, surely we will see the need for regulation that says, \"That kind of approach has to be applied everywhere.\" The fact is that in the Highlands and Islands strategic transport partnership&#8212;HITRANS&#8212;Shetland will be well provided for in that respect, but what about the Western Isles and Highland? How will the regional transport partnerships be able to bring other parts of their areas up to a better standard?</p><p>I turn to bus access in Highland. The difference between how access works in some areas and not in others comes into play. For example, there is a real lack of wheelchair-friendly buses in Highland. Since HITRANS will fund only Highland contractors to install wheelchair access, private contractors like taxis get no money and yet they are a means to link people in remote areas from their home to a concessionary fare system. We have to get that sorted out.<place-holder colnum=\"17415\"/></p><p>Community contracts can stress that wheelchair access be put in pace for community transport. That is the sort of thing that we have to have in terms of the general provision of buses.</p><p>My final remark is about access to radial services around the big centres. I hope that the Environment and Rural Development Committee inquiry into areas close to cities will look at the problem of providing transport not just from the centre to the periphery, but in the radial routes as well. The big problem in many areas that are close to big centres is that bus services do not provide that at present.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13341086", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport (Scotland) Act 2001"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Much of what I will say concerns those areas of   Scotland in which support from local authorities and from the new regional transport partnerships will be necessary if we are to achieve an integrated transport system.

Welsh is in a far stronger position than Gaelic, as are Catalan and Basque. Those languages started from a higher baseline of speakers, so we need added impetus from strong measures that will eventually be added to the act.

We have not heard a defence of the Government's renewable energy system, or a discussion of the problems that might arise in the decommissioning process.</p><p>I would like to dwell on a couple of those matters. In the far north of Scotland, the decommissioning process&#8212;a &#163;2.7 billion exercise&#8212;has been under way at Dounreay for some time. The UK Government splashed out a whole lot of money on nuclear investment. Since then, energy markets have been liberalised&#8212;I will come back to that. The Government must not skimp on ultra-safe dismantling measures and waste storage in order to handle what has been produced. However, it has been shown at Dounreay that far more waste is created during decommissioning; indeed, there is not enough storage space at Dounreay for the low-level waste, and for the gloves and other trivia that are used for dismantling. That waste will have to be shipped to Drigg, which was referred to earlier.</p><p>The SNP's policy is to deal in Scotland with the nuclear waste that is created in Scotland. There should have been plans ahead of time to have enough monitorable above-ground storage, but storage is not in place. The costs of nuclear decommissioning are far greater than has so far been estimated. The SNP believes that the kind of programme that is required must be made clear to the public in order to show how expensive and dangerous decommissioning is. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is steadily tackling the Dounreay nuclear legacy, but if the nuclear decommissioning agency comes into play it could use a tender process to bring in Bechtel, AMEC or other companies, which may cut corners on the way in which the job is done.</p><p>The staff at Dounreay are dedicated unionised public servants. This is a public problem, and the <place-holder colnum=\"16020\"/> SNP believes that we should deal with the matter in the public domain. Nuclear waste is the unsolved public problem; we must therefore find a way of dealing with Scottish waste in Scotland: we must not export waste or import anybody else's.</p><p>I turn to the argument about nuclear energy as a possible way of dealing with the problem of climate change. Climate change is a lifebelt for the nuclear industry because that industry believes that it can argue that nuclear energy would reduce emissions. However, it has been argued that if we take the money for a new nuclear power station and spend it on energy efficiency, five to seven times the amount of carbon dioxide would be removed from the atmosphere than if we built a nuclear power station. If experts are saying that, the Government had better tell us whether it agrees. The arguments that stack up in the SNP motion show clearly that if we have a mature and balanced debate, there can be no place for nuclear power and that if the Government is going to take climate change seriously, it must ensure that energy efficiency is a large part of that.</p>", "hdate": "2005-04-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13337658", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Nuclear Power"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate covers decommissioning of nuclear installations, the question of how waste storage is dealt with, and the SNP's total opposition to the creation of new nuclear power stations.

I will say a bit about Make Tracks. A project has been developed by Channel 4's Ideasfactory and goEVENTS, which is the trade group for the music industry in the Highlands and Islands. A series of workshops and showcase events in the Highlands was delivered by Make Tracks, and 12 trainees were selected to run a virtual record label. The label had an album launched in Finland at Europe's biggest trade fair for rock music, and the album went out to an additional 10,500 industry subscribers on the cover of the main trade music magazine, <em>Music Week</em>. Such examples show that bands from very small communities can find a market and can play at big festivals and in places at which agents and promoters are listening.</p><p>It is essential that the infrastructure that Pauline McNeill mentioned be permanently put in place in the full knowledge that rock music and contemporary music have been among the main means of expression for younger generations since rock and roll was invented back in the 1950s. They are also part of a wider scene about which we would expect the culture commission to make firm recommendations. Cultural rights are needed so that people can play and music is one of the major means of ensuring wide participation. Young people like to participate; they do not simply want to listen&#8212;increasingly, they want to play.</p><p>I have mentioned previously the value of &#163;6 million that has been put on Shetland's music enterprises. That is an amazing figure for a small group of islands, where there are many different kinds of music. We must ensure that the Scottish music industry takes on board all the different forms of contemporary music and that facilities are put in place so that each generation has a better chance to take off than the previous generation.</p><p>There has been a great start. Franz Ferdinand have shown a particular route, but we expect to <place-holder colnum=\"15426\"/> hear many more bands that we do not currently know about reaching the pinnacle of world success.

I warrant that the Environment and Rural Development Committee's report will suggest that there will have to be major changes in how we invest, particularly in relation to sustainability in housing and public transport. In the plan, the Executive tells us which elements it will spend on, but there may have to be a significant rejigging of those priorities.</p><p>I hope that Jeremy Purvis will note that Jim Mather talked about genuinely and incrementally increasing sustainable economic growth&#8212;the important point is that there be not just growth, but sustainable growth. Scotland is yet to have an Executive that takes that on board&#8212;the evidence that I have heard from ministers in various committees does not fill me with hope that they have done so.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13335803", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Infrastructure Investment Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the debate, the SNP has noted the underinvestment of the past 30 years.

He said in his reply that the information that I requested is not held centrally. It seems to me that if the Executive is to have an infrastructure investment plan and to state which areas are to be developed, it must get such information. Surely the fact that the information is not available is an indication that the proposals for transport in the plan have not been thought out as clearly as they should be.</p><p>I am also worried about the matter in relation to comparisons between Scotland and other European countries. Where structural funds have been spent in countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, rail investment has made up between 10 <place-holder colnum=\"15298\"/> and 20 per cent of the total. In the Tory years there was virtually no investment in rail, but in the past five years there has been little rail investment in the north of Scotland. I am glad that the suburban railway problem has been dealt with, but the longer routes, which include routes to the more remote parts of the south-west, the north-east and the north have yet to be addressed. The document ought also to address sustainability and the climate change imperatives, but it does not even mention them in outline. We need a change in the business case so that we can appraise railways in remote and sparsely populated areas appropriately. The Scottish transport appraisal guidance&#8212;or STAG&#8212;is fit for suburban railways and heavily populated areas, but Scotland is a country that has remote communities that can be reached only by crossing large areas of land. Some of those communities are quite large and need to be part of the action, but they will not be unless the investment is made.</p><p>Des McNulty talked about targeting deprived areas, but such areas include areas where populations are falling, such as the islands and the remote Highlands. On investment in ferries, I am at odds with the minister's sanguine approach to the question of whether we will get services that are fit for purpose. The Executive is frightened to go to Europe and say that the ferry services are essential services.</p><p>The question of state aid must be tackled. That issue arose recently when Ross Finnie spoke to farmers in Orkney about the movement of cattle from Orkney and Shetland to Wick.

Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian and the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, which represent the local business community, support the bill on economic grounds.</p><p>The waterfront development that will be served by the tram is acknowledged to be one of the largest urban renewal projects that has been undertaken in Scotland. SEEL felt that that development could accommodate some of the pressures of the expanding Edinburgh economy <place-holder colnum=\"14897\"/> and the promoter considers that it could bring up to 17,000 jobs to the area. However, I hope that the part that the Forth Ports Authority is playing in the process will emerge in the later stages of the bill.</p><p>Objectors have questioned whether there would be any linkage between trams and future economic development, given that the tramline is circular and goes no more than 2 miles from the centre of Edinburgh. The committee is persuaded that, on balance, an economic benefit will arise from the project and that the project will be a positive factor in attracting economic development. However, the figures for working out the ways in which congestion will be reduced are far more complicated. The promoter predicts that severe congestion in Edinburgh will increase as car use increases by 50 per cent between 2011 and 2021. Trams will constrain that congestion to current levels by encouraging drivers to use the tram. The promoter acknowledges that tramline 1 is forecast to bring about a reduction in car and van trips of only 1.5 million by 2026&#8212;a mere 1 per cent reduction&#8212;but it argues that that reduction will result in a disproportionate improvement in travel conditions for the remaining cars, which will experience quicker trips. The promoter has calculated that that improvement contributes 50 per cent of the overall benefit of the tram proposal.</p><p>The committee acknowledges that the potential impact of the tram in limiting road congestion to current levels would represent a considerable success and that, therefore, there is a benefit in introducing the tram. However, the committee remains concerned that much of the benefit is based on a projected 50 per cent increase in car traffic between 2011 and 2021. Some 50 per cent of the benefits of tramline 1 are attributed to the trams constraining that car traffic to current levels. The committee has agreed to revisit that issue if the bill progresses to the consideration stage. I believe that it is incumbent on the Scottish Parliament to ensure that we have clear and unequivocal answers to the questions about the issue. That will enable us to be sure that the tramline 1 proposal will work for the north of Edinburgh.</p><p>If one thinks that trams can solve specific problems, the tramline 1 proposal is great. However, trams must be viewed as part of an integrated strategy.

At the committee's meeting earlier this week, Professor David Crichton of the Benfield hazard research centre pointed out that, given that as many as 700,000 Scottish households live in fuel poverty, some mechanism is needed to raise energy standards as well as resilience standards. That comment puts into context the fact that we should take the work that has been done in the past on energy efficiency and warm, dry homes and apply the imperatives of climate change to increase the level of investment.</p><p>As my colleague Christine Grahame said, the fuel poverty strategy does not meet the needs of Scottish householders. It has tried to do so, and the efforts that have been made by local authorities and the Scottish Executive to move forward are, of course, welcome. However, our efforts on housing standards are still far behind those of Scandinavia. We are told that we have higher standards than other parts of the United Kingdom and we have had to adapt to our colder <place-holder colnum=\"14695\"/> climate to some extent, but we do not yet have the high standards that Scandinavia has enjoyed for the past 40 years.</p><p>During the passage of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, my colleague Linda Fabiani lodged an amendment that contained a series of suggestions, but it was rejected in favour of the Government's position on the fuel poverty strategy. Her suggestions included measures to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"improve the thermal efficiency of insulation\",</p><p>to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"assist households in budgeting for their fuel costs effectively\"</p><p>and to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"require a regular energy audit of each home\".</p><p>It seems to me that those suggestions go to the heart of how we should tackle individual properties. It would be a big step forward for the Parliament to endorse the idea of every house having an energy efficiency logbook in which notes are made every time that the property's energy efficiency is reviewed in relation to the current standards. Such logbooks would have wider benefits when houses are built and sold on. The Environment and Rural Development Committee's climate change inquiry will probably address that matter.</p><p>We find ourselves in a cleft stick: some local authorities have tried to increase standards beyond the standards that Communities Scotland applies to buildings but they have found themselves in difficulties because they are not funded to a sufficient level. For example, the Western Isles has tried to ensure that older people are given far higher standards to deal with the climate problems there.</p><p>It bothers me that we are not having a full debate at this stage about the potential for energy balance reviews, which are needed so that we can see the total energy that is used not just in houses but in our daily lives. Such reviews are being applied on the small island of Unst, where the promoting Unst renewable energy&#8212;or PURE&#8212;project is not only a means of creating hydrogen cell technology but is moving people away from using heating oils and other hydrocarbon fuels.</p><p>We must ensure that the Government in Edinburgh expresses the strongest possible support not only for the hydrogen cell technology approach but for energy balance reviews, which should be done in every community throughout the country. It seems that the London Government is not interested in our developing hydrogen cell technology and is prepared&#8212;if the press is to be believed&#8212;to leave that to the Chinese, the Indians and the Americans.

It is clear from the Highland Council's list that even areas on the east coast, such as North Kessock and others close to Inverness, were affected by the recent extreme weather. I note that the Minister for Justice will report to the ministerial group on civil contingencies; I would like to hear from her today about some of her responses to the group.</p><p>I am concerned to press the views of the people in the middle district who sought a strategic assessment of the hydrology and physical geography of the machair, because it is no exaggeration to say that if inundations were to breach the machair with salt water on a sustained basis, new islands could be created and a chain of events in South Uist, North Uist and Benbecula could be triggered. Such events could take place unless first, an emergency plan is put in place and, eventually, funding is put in place to create defences against the sea. We need only consider the piles of stones that were thrown into the playground at Balivanich Primary School&#8212;anyone who had been present when that happened would have been killed&#8212;to understand the power of the sea, as the people whose views we heard last week described.</p><p>It is essential that Parliament acknowledge that it will take a lot of money and a lot of good planning to deal with the results of these extreme events. We therefore ask the minister how we can move on from contingency funding. In the Highland Council area, more than &#163;5 million of damage was caused, but the Bellwin formula will trigger only a fraction of that. It is a similar story in the Western Isles. It is totally inadequate that that is how the present contingency funding programme will kick in.<place-holder colnum=\"14668\"/></p><p>We ask the minister to respond to Alasdair Morrison's excellent motion, which mentions the kind of studies that should take place. We know that we will have to break new ground in dealing with such circumstances and we look forward to the whole Parliament being able to work together to deal with natural disasters. At present Britain, Argentina and Israel appear to be the only countries that do not provide their citizens with funding to support themselves in natural disasters. Most other countries have systems in place. I would like to think that the disaster in the Western Isles, with its loss of life, will trigger a different response from this united Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2005-02-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13334237", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Western Isles (Extreme Weather Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Alasdair Morrison for lodging the motion and I congratulate him on securing the debate.

Deer estates, it is suggested, could have caused up to anything in the region of 15,000 accidents in Scotland, including nine fatalities, in the five years prior to 2003. I do not believe for one minute that those accidents were caused by speeding drivers, because I have been involved in such an accident, in 1981, on the dual carriageway at Ballinluig.

In the Highlands, the real objection is that most wind farms are not owned by local people.

We need to recognise that the public goods that will be drawn from rural development funds in future increasingly will allow people in the poorest parts of the north, the west and the islands to get more value from having units of production that not only produce excellent and ever-improving headage, but deliver the environmental benefits for which those areas are particularly well suited.<place-holder colnum=\"13583\"/></p><p>In areas of more intensive farming, the problem is that the countryside is much more industrialised. That means that it is difficult to turn some areas into land of any great environmental benefit. The new openness and accountability will allow us to find out the level of subsidy in different parts of the country. The debate on that issue is important for how we view agriculture in the future.</p><p>At yesterday's meeting of the Environment and Rural Development Committee, the Minister for Environment and Rural Development stated that the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 would allow us to find out about levels of subsidy. I questioned the minister on the subject and we had quite a debate about it. Some people get very large subsidies; indeed, there might be farmers in Scotland who get &#163;1 million in subsidies. I do not know whether that is the case, but we will be able to find out very soon. If a single farm business is receiving that level of subsidy, surely it would be far better if there were 20 farm businesses with 20 families living on the countryside and maintaining and developing it. One could say, as the minister has done and as others might do, that large farms are viable. However, traceability and quality products that have taste do not necessarily go with large and so-called viable farms.</p><p>I am happy that the National Farmers Union of Scotland wants us to support it in the fair trade campaign for milk, but I want something from it in return, which is an agreement to absolute openness and to a debate on how to distribute the cash to best deliver public goods in future. I hope that this debate will be another chance for us to impress on the Scottish Executive the fact that it is essential to address that debate head on. Crofters welcome the forthcoming openness on subsidies. They say that it is high time that people saw how unevenly money is distributed.

I am glad that the Conservatives support that in Opposition, but I wish that they would support it in Government&#8212;not that they are likely to be in Government in the future.</p><p>There is a dichotomy here: we have a Government that says, in its forward strategy for agriculture, that shortening the food chain is recognised as a good thing. At the same time, it says that consumers will pay only a certain amount and that it cannot interfere at the level at which consumers buy cheaper product from abroad. We are aware that the quality of meat that is produced in local abattoirs is generally far better. In \"Rick Stein's Food Heroes\" programme on television the other night he pointed out that meat from contented local animals that are killed locally is more tender. That is what people demand at the level of the farmers' market, but what most people are offered is not at that level or of that quality. Indeed, we have a Government that seems to have thrown in the towel on dealing with the fact that we are not able to feed the majority of the population from the produce of their local areas.</p><p>Take the example of Caithness. In 2002, the red meat survey for the Highlands and Islands showed that there was a beef supply of 10,388 one and <place-holder colnum=\"12973\"/> two-year-old beasts, but the local demand was 2,224. Much of the beef that can be produced in Caithness has to be sold outwith the county, but the fact is that, unless it can be branded as Caithness meat, it is unlikely to sell . We must be able to brand produce, not only from the islands, as Maureen Macmillan suggested, but from local areas throughout the country so as to attract a market. The local abattoir&#8212;which was closed and that has now reopened to serve local butchers&#8212;could be doing much more if we could invest in local branding. We will be interested to hear what the minister has to say about that.</p><p>The Orkney brand clearly works well, but we are fundamentally interested not only in trying to give a new lease of life to areas that have been struggling economically, but in founding a new means of operating whereby people can have secure and sustainable futures. I suggest that we must cut the costs of running abattoirs if we have any means to do so.

However, we consider that setting out a timetable for the adoption and application of a framework for spatial planning of marine and coastal resources, including fish farming, is now a top priority. That would allow the aquaculture framework to fit into the planned strategic environmental assessment of Scotland's coastlines that was announced by the Deputy First Minister Jim Wallace on 23 November 2004. If we are to avoid the unwanted accusations of bad neighbourly behaviour being levelled by some of those who oppose fish farming, and if we are to square the interests of conservation, fishers, the military and all other users of our inshore waters, it makes sense to speed up the delivery of spatial planning processes as the key to sustainability.</p><p>Let us take the aquaculture framework plans as our example. In 2002, Shetland Islands Council won an award for its new regime for the aquaculture industry. It has created a new, <place-holder colnum=\"12483\"/> planning-led marine development control regime using new technology to aid policy and implementation and successfully combines land and sea-based map data. This country requires such building blocks within a spatial plan.</p><p>Two years previously, the judges of the Scottish awards for quality planning commended the Loch Eriboll plan that was prepared by a team from Highland Council. What use are such plans unless the inhibitors to sustainable development are removed? Loch Eriboll has a number of oyster and mussel operations, and although a number of leases have been granted they have not been taken up. National planning guidelines insist that a potential superquarry could exploit the shores of the loch. Every would-be shellfish lessee is warned of the possibility of such a superquarry and its impact. In effect, development of those ultra-clean waters is blighted by national decree, no matter how unlikely the development of the superquarry. A coastal strategy must remove such threats.</p><p>Existing shellfish producers in the area complain of other inhibitors to development. The Scottish Executive could take urgent action to ease the costs of transporting shellfish to markets from remote Highland mainland and island producers because next-day delivery is a must. In his autumn statement today, the chancellor is going to be talking about the cost of fuel, which is central to the success of much of the industry. What input does the minister have on that subject? Ministers could intervene with the Royal Mail to ensure that parcel force collects in small communities such as Tongue and Durness. Ministers could ensure that ScotRail reinstates the red star parcel service on the far north, Kyle and Oban railway lines so that small packets of shellfish could be carried that way. Small producers are the backbone of a sustainable industry and they are the most disadvantaged when it comes to finding economic alternatives.

Undoubtedly, the actions of supermarkets affect the vast majority of people. What is the Scottish Government doing to ensure that the supermarkets operate in a competitive framework that we in Scotland can be happy to <place-holder colnum=\"12277\"/> sign up to? I know that the matter is reserved, but we need a combined Scottish voice to show that, across all the parties, we are dissatisfied with the voluntary code of practice and want to find a way of making the code statutory.</p><p>How do we do that? The NFUS has suggested that the voluntary code should not only cover the supermarkets but be extended to the whole supply chain. Farmers rarely deal directly with the supermarkets, so they are not covered by the code. The code should be extended to include farmers who supply via an intermediary such as a wholesaler or a dairy. That suggests that the way in which the code was drawn up was not all encompassing. We need to revisit the code to ensure that it protects each of the steps in the chain.</p><p>Scott Barrie and others have talked about the way in which the Competition Commission has acted. If any members have read Joanna Blythman's book \"Shopped: The Shocking Power of British Supermarkets\", they will recognise that the Competition Commission has not been tough enough in dealing with complaints; the few that have been made have drifted away into the sand.</p><p>For example, in 1999, the English NFU complained to the Competition Commission about Safeway's demand that producers pay money to join an ethical trading initiative. Has anything changed? Well, Safeway merely said that the scheme was not compulsory and that producers could say if they did not want to take part. The fact is that anyone who puts their head above the parapet knows that they will be blacklisted. That example and many others show that the Competition Commission's control has not worked.</p><p>Scott Barrie suggested that the partnership agreement was beginning to tackle such problems, but we have waited through today's debate for the minister or any Labour or Liberal Democrat member to tell us what the Scottish Government is doing. Will we hear something new in the minister's winding-up speech? We have heard nothing new so far.</p><p>I have two quotations that sum up the conflicting aspects of the debates. The first is from the Scottish Retail Consortium's briefing, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Net profit margins across all the supermarket groups have not increased over the past 10 years, with the average operating margin being tighter now than in the 1990's. This is clear evidence of efficiency gains being passed on directly to consumers.\"</p><p>In contrast, the NFUS briefing states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Farmers are at the raw end of the deal, and not just on milk. Whether it is milk, meat, fruit or vegetable production, the cut-throat business of winning market-share is driving down prices, with farmers paying the ultimate price.\"<place-holder colnum=\"12278\"/></p><p>If that does not describe the crisis that we face because of the lack of control over the big supermarkets and the lack of a Scottish voice to deal with that, I do not know what does. Those contrasting statements illustrate the problem exactly.</p><p>Nora Radcliffe told us that the Government is conducting an investigation. We would like to know what that investigation is doing and when we will hear about it&#8212;perhaps the minister can tell us what is going on. The SNP's amendment asks the minister to call a summit and to have regular meetings with the supermarkets to express what I believe is the widespread view in the chamber that their practices have to change. That will enable us in Scotland to have a collective voice. If the Government will not be the representative of that collective voice, who will be? The Scottish Executive should speak up.</p><p>We have to consider the Government's role, but the consumer's role is important, too. In order to make any progress, we have to make the higher demands that consumers in Europe make of their supermarkets. We must educate people to use their power and to think about the way in which they buy produce. People must recognise that, if they continue to buy convenience food, that will not realise the potential for far healthier food.</p><p>The producers have tried to get vertical integration, as George Lyon mentioned. Fergus Ewing asked that the producers be given better bargaining powers. My arguments have shown the need for far more Scottish produce to be processed in Scotland, as the Government's amendment says. However, we need a framework to be put in place to allow that to happen, as the evidence shows that it is not happening at the moment. We demand action. We must have a summit on food immediately so that we can make progress and tell the British Government what Scotland thinks.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food (Supermarkets)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate has allowed us to determine whether the Government in Scotland has taken any part in an attempt to review the role of the big four supermarkets.

Schools and the careers service must have a strong focus on the potential for green jobs, but such a focus does not yet exist. The Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department and the Education Department have a major joint role to play in creating that focus.</p><p>About four years ago, the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales produced \"The Sustainable Careers Handbook\", which lists a range of jobs that will be needed for as long as there are people on the planet. The range of jobs enables us to consider career options at all levels of qualification. There are case studies and there is a directory of jobs that sets out categories that the children in our schools should be encouraged to consider and discuss.</p><p>A careers adviser might say to a pupil, \"Do you think you would like to become an accountant?\" Perhaps if the pupil had the ammunition, he or she would be able to say, \"Yes. I would like to become the accountant in a renewable energy firm.\" Pupils could gear their skills specifically to the kind of green jobs that we now require. I do not see any detail in the motion about how the policy is rooted in schools or the careers service. When I was a guidance teacher I would, when I was advising children, have benefited enormously from having the kind of information that is in the handbook that I mentioned. At this stage, in 2004, Scotland has a bit of catching up to do with the non-governmental organisation that produced the handbook four years ago.</p><p>An important aspect of green jobs is the creation of confidence in communities. The creation of such confidence through the creative arts is one of the best forms of continuous employment in the green jobs that currently exist. A project has just taken place in the Highlands that sets examples that could be used in other areas. The project is called 2gether and is about sustainability, citizenship and enterprise in education. It links schools, communities and businesses in the Highlands and Islands. A report on it was produced from research that was gathered at the end of last year, which was commissioned by Careers Scotland in the Highlands and Islands. The overall aim was to consider the concept of sustainability in relation to the citizenship agenda and enterprise in education. The research is wide ranging and encompasses global citizenship and the role of the arts in remote communities.</p><p>As I said, a range of jobs in the arts are coming into the new economy. Such jobs can create circumstances in which people will feel that where those jobs are is a place where they want to live, where they want to sustain jobs, where they want their children to grow up, and where they know that the work that they do now will sustain jobs in <place-holder colnum=\"12183\"/> the future. As far as such confidence is concerned, it is clear from all the research that the concept of sustainability must not be a bolt-on or an extra: there is no alternative. Therefore, in order to root sustainability in the behaviour of people in this country we must give them the cultural confidence to believe that it is a central part of their existence.</p><p>New ways to measure growth in the economy are important, which Richard Dixon talked about in his briefing to us. Gross domestic product considers only the monetary part of growth in the economy, but the value of environmental and cultural wealth and confidence are new measures that must be built into the calculation. Those new measures should be part of a targeting process that shows that we are making a start at one point and moving to another point. The new measures should reflect the extent to which people in different sorts of communities&#8212;whether inner-city areas or the most remote areas&#8212;feel better about living in their country. Sustainability cannot be something that people are told they must achieve; rather, they must feel that to do so is natural. Government must build sustainability into its selling of itself.</p><p>We have been resold \"A Smart, Successful Scotland\" by Mr Wallace, but unless the word \"sustainable\" is attached to the other three S's, the document is completely meaningless. That must come out of the review; that word must be attached to the strategy. I hope that Allan Wilson will in his summing up confirm that it will be.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, the debate is a great opportunity to recognise that we build from the bottom in society. The Government's ability to intervene in the education system, in our schools and in the careers service, over which it has power, can enable people to think in ways that will create a self-sustaining approach to sustainable jobs. That is why we built into our amendment the concept that having more fiscal powers and being able to encourage investment and so on would underpin our ability to go out and ensure sustainability. All members agree to an extent that until we have full power or&#8212;in the opinion of some members&#8212;greater powers to make such investments, we will not achieve sustainability or the mood that is required to create it.</p><p>Sustainability, social justice and subsidiarity&#8212;the right of people to make decisions locally and to have the autonomy to do so with confidence&#8212;are at the root of the debate. The sophistry of the Tory members shows them to be the kind of people who would demean a debate about green jobs on the basis of a pun. Such people are not fit for the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish people, and we should treat them with the contempt that they deserve.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327720", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Jobs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Towards its end, my friend Jim Mather's amendment mentions \"increased demand for more sustainable products and processes and increased 'green' employment.\" It is important that we recognise the big wins that can be had and which the minister underlined, but sustainable jobs will be created only by small steps being taken in the other part of the minister's   portfolio, which is lifelong...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Gibson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80036", "house": "4", "member_id": "80036", "person_id": "13993", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Highlands and Islands"}, "section_id": "13327720", "hpos": "91", "gid": "2004-11-24.12181.0", "epobject_id": "13327805", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2004-11-24.12151.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13993+section%3Asp#g12181.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "15:53:00", "speaker_id": "80036"}, {"body": "<p>Will the member advise us whether those weighty reports set any targets to be achieved in the areas that she mentioned or do they merely contain aspirations?</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327720", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Jobs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Will the member advise us whether those weighty reports set any targets to be achieved in the areas that she mentioned or do they merely contain aspirations?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Gibson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80036", "house": "4", "member_id": "80036", "person_id": "13993", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Highlands and Islands"}, "section_id": "13327720", "hpos": "55", "gid": "2004-11-24.12168.2", "epobject_id": "13327769", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2004-11-24.12151.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13993+section%3Asp#g12168.2", "minor": "0", "htime": "15:17:00", "speaker_id": "80036"}, {"body": "<p>Does Mr Fraser recognise that the thinnings from forests can be used for biomass projects, which are needed in many schools and public buildings, and that they do not need to go into the making of paper?</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327720", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Jobs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Does Mr Fraser recognise that the thinnings from forests can be used for biomass projects, which are needed in many schools and public buildings, and that they do not need to go into the making of paper?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Gibson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80036", "house": "4", "member_id": "80036", "person_id": "13993", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Highlands and Islands"}, "section_id": "13327720", "hpos": "25", "gid": "2004-11-24.12163.0", "epobject_id": "13327739", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2004-11-24.12151.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13993+section%3Asp#g12163.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "14:59:00", "speaker_id": "80036"}, {"body": "<p>Why is Mr Fraser offering advice to the minister when he confesses to knowing nothing about the subject?</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327720", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Jobs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Why is Mr Fraser offering advice to the minister when he confesses to knowing nothing about the subject?", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Gibson", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80036", "house": "4", "member_id": "80036", "person_id": "13993", "party": "Scottish National Party", "constituency": "Highlands and Islands"}, "section_id": "13327720", "hpos": "27", "gid": "2004-11-24.12163.2", "epobject_id": "13327741", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2004-11-24.12151.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13993+section%3Asp#g12163.2", "minor": "0", "htime": "14:59:00", "speaker_id": "80036"}, {"body": "<p>Roseanna Cunningham focused on the nub of the issue and I thank her for raising it.

We advised Football Data Co in writing (August 2004) that if a commercially acceptable agreement could be reached, Littlewoods Football Pools would pay any agreed level of monies in connection with the 2004/5 season effective from the beginning of the season.\"</p><p>It is important to put those words on the record to underline the fact that although people have been concerned that we are trying to deal with a private dispute, we are talking about the commitment of one football pools company to pay back the money that football clubs thought they were due this season. It would be useful to know the attitude of other pools companies in that respect, because it is important that the money flows in due course. If we had that guarantee, it might be possible for the minister to broker some sort of deal. I hope that she will tell us how she might go about that.<place-holder colnum=\"11976\"/></p><p>Clubs such as Ross County Football Club, which is in my neck of the woods and has been setting up a football academy and building a future on the basis of its being a strong community club, should not have to face the kind of blow that this crisis has dealt. All members know of clubs that require the sort of approach that Ross County is taking. It has been go-ahead in its attitude and has found ways to get finance to support its football academy.</p><p>The problem is that changing betting habits are reducing the amount that the football pools companies can offer. That issue has been creeping up on us for a long time. We have heard the figures about reductions in staff in the pools companies and their reduced revenue. If their revenues continue to decrease, which is entirely possible, we will have to find some other method to recompense the football clubs that relied on the money. Can the minister assure us that there will be a means by which to intervene at an early stage to ensure that the cash flow continues and that the other pools companies are prepared to make back payments when the problem is resolved?</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327306", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pools Companies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Roseanna Cunningham focused on the nub of the issue and I thank her for raising it.

Scottish Water's delivery outputs cannot be measured by comparisons with English and Welsh privatised water companies because those companies have had many more years to arrive at their present working practices and pricing systems. We should be comparing our industry with that down south of perhaps 10 years ago; to do otherwise would be to make a truly unfair comparison.</p><p>It is essential that we do not go down any further roads that allow those who are in charge of competition to have more of a say in the way that the public water system runs, but I welcome the way in which Scottish Water has sought the help of Scottish Water Solutions Ltd to deliver a more uniform service throughout the country. Indeed, we await with interest the development of the work of Scottish Water Solutions to see whether it produces the goods.</p><p>The bill clarifies the powers that the minister, the water industry commission and Scottish Water will share for the delivery of the service, but Ross Finnie has said that hard decisions will still have to be made in allocating the budget, which accounts for about 4 per cent&#8212;a large chunk&#8212;of the Scottish Executive's total spend.</p><p>On 5 October, Ross Finnie told the Environment and Rural Development Committee:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"When considering the money available to develop more affordable housing, we have to get the balance of investment right in Q and S III, to ensure that as many affordable houses as possible are built.\"</p><p>He also said that we must consider that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"this may not have received enough attention before\",</p><p>and he has admitted as much in his answer to the question that my colleague John Swinney asked.

At present, there is so much inflexibility in the system that we look for political direction that will try to open doors to Scottish Water being given more options to deal with the issues as they come along. There are far too many examples throughout the country of the economies of large and small communities being stymied by that inflexibility.</p><p>I must deal with customer complaints and references to the Competition Commission. The SNP wants the customer complaints process to be made much more transparent. My village has just experienced a cut in water supplies. The repairs have been handled excellently, as has the compensation for customers who were affected, but the sources of information for those in the midst of a crisis were poor, and the SNP would like to think that Scottish Water will be given the opportunity to create better communications with the public that it exists to serve. Above all, the SNP wants the customers, who are paying for the water, to be given the service that they deserve. They must be told what is happening as it happens so that they can have confidence that Scottish Water will meet their needs.</p><p>On the charge determination process, we do not think that it is a good idea that appeals should go to the Competition Commission down south, and we will examine that measure closely at stage 2. The Environment and Rural Development Committee heard from the Competition Commission that it is perfectly capable of dealing with a public water system as well as privatised water companies, but we want to examine that point very carefully to see whether the appeals procedure could be handled differently.</p><p>We have given general support to the way in which the bill has been laid out, but there are areas of it that open the door to other aspects of competition thinking that are not appropriate in the Scottish context.</p><p>Scottish Water uses around half the engineering capacity that is presently available in Scotland.

People seem to be allowed to smoke at outdoor tables in restaurants. The people who serve the food or who sit at neighbouring tables&#8212;as Jean Turner described&#8212;are affected by the smoke. That approach seems to be inconsistent, given that people are not allowed to smoke on station concourses in Ireland. I have to queue for the 5.40 pm north-bound train from Edinburgh to Inverness with people who are desperately puffing away before they board the train, so it was a delight to find that the concourse of Heuston station in Dublin was smoke free.

As a result, it is important that the debate focuses on how local people, particularly those who are already based in the Highlands, can own and develop such schemes. Maureen Macmillan's point is well taken.</p><p>We need to establish a clearer picture of the work that the Scottish Executive will do to allow that to happen, because it has an influence over HIE, which is somewhat late in the game in backing much of this kind of work. The wind farm in our community in Evanton has been bringing a benefit to the community for six years, but HIE has had a strategy in this respect for only two years.

As a teacher of some 20 years' experience in schools, I know that the problem of getting children taught as children, rather than as people who fit into a particular list for a certain subject, is at the heart of the matter. We have to take a pupil-centred approach.</p><p>Is there a need for a revolution? It has been suggested that we make international comparisons, and Iain Macwhirter made one in the <em>Sunday Herald</em> when he pointed out that the OECD benchmark shows that<place-holder colnum=\"11444\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland is not only ahead of England in key areas such as reading and maths, but outperforms countries like Germany and Sweden almost across the board. Even in science, not one of Scotland's strengths, we rank ninth out of 32.\"</p><p>We are talking about the need not for a revolution to transform our situation, but for continuity and appropriateness in the kind of schools that we see throughout the country.</p><p>Murdo Fraser implied that we are an overwhelmingly urban nation. A third of people live in small towns and small rural communities; more and more people are living in such communities as the largest towns decrease in size. The experience of the bottom 20 per cent of pupils in those communities is the same as it is in the cities. This is a national issue about how we enthuse the low achievers, who live in Wick just as they do in Dennistoun. We must have a strategy that approaches that problem.</p><p>If we are to make international comparisons, let us pay attention to the Cook's tour that is about to begin&#8212;in Sweden, Norway or wherever, there is much more local accountability for the way in which schools are run. Councillors in the catchment areas of secondary schools have responsibility for them. We do not have that in our system.</p><p>If we are to develop education, we must make those head teachers with devolved powers more accountable to the community in which they find themselves. We are a party of decentralisation, not a party that just sets national standards and places education in isolation from what happens in the communities around it. The debate is about social inclusion, but it is also about giving people in those communities some say in the way the school works and about making the head teachers, who are trained to lead, accountable to those communities. Those points add substance to the debate that it lacks at present.</p><p>Although it is good that we have philanthropic Tom Hunter to offer leadership academies for heidies, we said in the most recent debate on the subject that teachers have been expecting better training for 30 years. Have we had it? We have heard it talked about, but we have still not had the kind of input that would allow teachers to progress.</p><p>Changes will mean that there will be fewer teachers in the next period of time. In the next 10 years, perhaps about 40 per cent of teachers will retire. The Government says that we need 53,000 teachers to provide specialists to bridge the gap between primary and secondary education and new specialists in physical education, art, drama and music to replace those teachers who are retiring. It is convenient that we will have fewer pupils&#8212;perhaps that is how we will achieve the teacher numbers&#8212;but the fact remains that many <place-holder colnum=\"11445\"/> of those who are retiring are the people who have the skills to meet the new requirements. There is no discrimination against modern studies or music teachers being kept on; we are losing skilled people across the board and there is no plan in place to ensure that those losses are made up in the specialisms that will enhance the experience of pupils.</p><p>Continuity is important. There have been many initiatives; indeed, this Government is guilty of an initiative frenzy because initiatives make good headlines. It would be a good idea to transfer the youth music initiative, which is guaranteed for three years and will allow primary 6 pupils to experience music training, into the core curriculum instead of delivering it through the Scottish Arts Council, although that has been very good.</p><p>We need to look at ways in which to inspire children. Graham Berry of the Scottish Arts Council pointed out what we all know:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Research has shown that involvement in the arts can not only inspire and challenge children, but increase their educational attainment and develop confidence and communication skills, so strengthening the position of the expressive arts in the school curriculum will continue to be one of our key objectives.\"</p><p>How can we possibly have motivated children and active citizens if they are denied the opportunity to take part in such activities in the core curriculum? The minister's plans emphasise the basics, but, as others have said, there needs to be more emphasis on exposure to the arts.</p><p>How will we square such circles? I hope that the minister, when he replies to the debate, will tell us whether he will make the kind of investment that I have mentioned; whether the necessary number of teachers will be available; and whether pupils, who deserve to be involved in such an approach, will be able to see whether this so-called revolution will deliver it.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13325957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We should start by sweeping away some of the spin in this debate, which is getting in the way of finding out what pupils experience.

After all, Caledonia, which means wooded heights, was the name that the Romans gave to Scotland. Forests sustained the ancient population as well as offering them protection. However, over the centuries, that relationship has been severed.</p><p>In T C Smout's 2003 book \"People and Woods in Scotland\", Alexander Mather concluded:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in recent times, people have been separated from the forest, geographically, environmentally and managerially.\"</p><p>That is the reality of Scottish forest ownership and management today. For example, crofters were given the right to grow and harvest trees only in 1991, as were tenant farmers. However, it does not have to be so. Consider Hordaland in west Norway. It has similar geographic features and climate to the Highlands, but its forests are mainly native Scots pine and broadleaves whereas Scotland's are mainly sitka spruce. There is also a marked difference in how the forests are used and in who owns them. As Nora Radcliffe suggested, perhaps we ought to consider whether the strategic aims of Forestry Commission Scotland should be changed.</p><p>In west Norway, 87 per cent of the forest is owned by individuals&#8212;50 per cent of whom are farmers&#8212;and 95 per cent of that forest is privately owned. In Norway as a whole, the forest owners federation numbers 56,000 members, who grow 60 per cent of the productive forests in the nation. Those members negotiate timber prices with the Government and they control 75 per cent of the timber market. That suggests to me that as the SNP amendment talks about having a greater mix of public, community and private ownership of forests, we ought to consider successful models such as that in Norway. Compare those figures with the Scottish forests. The largest Scottish landowner is the Forestry Commission, along with a few hundred private owners, whereas there are 125,000 owners in Norway. Terry Wogan used to own a forest in Caithness. Need we ask who needs a better system?<place-holder colnum=\"11374\"/></p><p>Far too little of our timber is grown or used for construction, yet locally produced Douglas fir, larch and oak could make frames, cladding and high-quality fittings for energy-efficient, low-cost housing as happens in Norway. The artist Lotte Glob's house, which is made of larch post and beam with European oak cladding, and which is sited beside Loch Eriboll in Sutherland, was today short-leeted in the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland award finals. That shows that homes made of wood could go main stream, because that house cost only &#163;70,000 to build. The house was pipped at the post, but did well in the competition. We could have many more houses like that.</p><p>Local materials can create homes that are fit for our people. Expanding locally controlled forestry is at the heart of the community trust movement. The north Sutherland community forest trust in Borgie is a good example of that. The trust wants to turn some Forestry Commission land into woodland crofts and recreational land. Negotiations have been tortuous, but the trust could transform the chances of a small north-coast community housing the people who want to stay there. Many members throughout the chamber have urged the minister to ensure not only that forests can provide land for people to live on, but that people can live in the forests themselves and have access to them.</p><p>The community forest movement is dynamic, but its funding is crucial. The Government boasts of 70 partnership agreements between the Forestry Commission and communities, but there should be hundreds of such partnerships and energy must be put into achieving that. Given the potential for biomass, it would surely be possible to have many more partnerships between the commission and local communities that would focus specifically on that target. We ask the minister to respond to that possibility. It is a pity that the report on the Forestry Commission's efforts and the minister's take on them was made available only at lunchtime, or we might have had more detail on those efforts.</p><p>The SNP believes that having far more forest owners could transform forestry prospects. The Assynt crofters trust has planted hundreds of thousands of trees in the past 10 years. However, the nearby Vestey shooting estate, which is now on the market, has planted only a couple of trial plots to measure exposure. People and the forest go together and Scotland should aspire to having more people live on forest land, based on forestry industries.</p><p>In the past, our forests protected us from invading armies; for the future, we must let the people reclaim the forests to safeguard their future. Geographically, environmentally and managerially a much tougher forestry policy for <place-holder colnum=\"11375\"/> Scotland is called for.

Staff heartache has been caused and apparent ministerial muddle has been found, but we have an excellent report and a response that shows some kind of way ahead.</p><p>On the human scale, I want to home in on the care for staff. When I was a youngster applying for a job in the civil service, I had to answer the question of what was more important: what I worked at or where I worked. Everyone would like to have a balance between the two; however, the civil service was interested in my saying that what I worked at was more important. Part of our expectation of public service is the expectation that people will meet the needs of our country's geography and of the social inclusion that is a criterion for the Parliament's and the Government's work in the partnership programme.<place-holder colnum=\"10168\"/></p><p>So, how will we get back to a situation in which being required to work in another part of the country is part of people's thinking about public service? In private business, people can be told to move at the drop of a hat. Nevertheless, I agree with the recommendation that, in the context of a strategy that allows us to make policy decisions that could remove headquarters, sections of departments and parts of quangos from Edinburgh, we must consider staff rights carefully and make contingency plans for people who are not prepared to move.</p><p>Matching the needs of our geography is quite difficult. I will talk in particular about the far north mainland of Scotland to show members the problems that we have there. Previous Tory Government policies centralised our local government. Health services were also centralised and taken out of Caithness and Sutherland. During that process in the mid-1990s, 250 well-paid jobs were lost to the east Caithness area. Wick has a population of about 7,500 and the centralisation of local government and health services cost the area a lot of quality jobs. It is up to us to find ways to replace those jobs by redistributing civil service jobs and to do justice to areas that have been badly dealt with in the past.</p><p>The committee's report considers the series of criteria that are required for relocation. I had the pleasure of sitting on the committee for the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine Railway and Linked Improvements Bill and one of Alloa's key arguments was that it would have a good rail link that would allow it to attract Government jobs to the area. I ask members to think about the people of Caithness and Sutherland and in other parts of the country who need that kind of infrastructure. There is no mention in current Government plans of the development of railways to the far north, but there should be. Any relocation policy affects other Government departments and their policies have to be in sync. We have to have transport plans that take into account this important relocation policy.</p><p>Earlier in the year, I asked Andy Kerr some questions about the use of videoconferencing. The point about setting up headquarters in various parts of the country is that the practice of videoconferencing is quite widespread. It is done from Government offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Inverness, Dundee and Aberdeen. Indeed, the Highlands and Islands university network has videoconferencing. Recently, I was told that there is an increase in the number of offices being set up for videoconferencing in Inverurie, Portree and Inverness. The use of videoconferencing has increased year on year during the past five years.</p><p>The indication is that the technology that we now have makes it entirely possible and easy for <place-holder colnum=\"10169\"/> people to shift their jobs. However, clearly the way in which decentralisation and relocation have been handled leaves a lot to be desired. We should consider the policy very carefully. If Scotland gets full federal financial freedom&#8212;or even full financial freedom&#8212;jobs might well be relocated from London, and the last place that they should come to is Edinburgh. It would be a good idea for us to put some plans in place to help the rest of Scotland to benefit without the problems that we have experienced in relocating from the centre of Edinburgh. Objections to relocation on the basis that it causes problems for employees and their families must be taken into account, but the policy that we have must allow us to help people to realise that they will serve in all of Scotland. If Ireland can shift approximately 50 per cent of its civil service jobs over several years, we need to make a bigger plan than we have at present to show that Scotland is as committed to the out-of-the-way or remoter areas.</p><p>I commend the committee's report and the Government's response, but I want there to be some substance to a policy that recognises the argument that places such as Wick deserve to get help and to get it quickly.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13322732", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Relocation of Public Sector Jobs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a pleasure to speak in this debate, which we must consider in terms of the reach that our Parliament has and the human scale.

On the basis of that, I believe that it has produced a fair, objective and thorough report, although I accept that the objectors will be disappointed with the report's conclusions.</p><p>The convener, Bill Butler&#8212;Railway Bill&#8212;referred in his opening speech to issues about consultation and compensation. Objectors expressed several concerns about the promoter's performance on consultation arrangements. Although the <place-holder colnum=\"9837\"/> committee indicated in its report that it was satisfied with the adequacy of the accompanying documents to the bill, one of which sets out the promoter's arrangements for consultation, the promoter could have been more forthcoming in explaining to objectors the basis on which compensation would be paid. Some objectors had to go to unnecessary lengths to extract information from the promoter on the matter.</p><p>The committee asked the promoter to set out how it intends to explain more clearly the basis on which compensation may be paid. The promoter responded positively to the committee and offered to provide a leaflet on the matter, which would be widely distributed. Objectors have been informed of the promoter's intentions.</p><p>I understand that the promoter has awarded the contract for phase 1 of the design and build and that, during that phase, the promoter will work with the contractor to develop a consultation strategy for the remainder of the project's duration. In tandem, the promoter will commence detailed discussions with landowners who will be directly affected by the works, to discuss the possibility of obtaining land and rights by agreement, rather than by exercising the compulsory purchase powers that are in the bill. Those discussions will continue until land acquisition is complete.</p><p>Continuing consultation and dialogue between the promoter and individuals about the detailed design of the project and the specific mitigation measures that will require to be put in place will be an issue. The identification and agreement of mitigation measures will be a key element of those discussions. During this first phase, the discussions will revolve around concepts&#8212;for example, whether noise mitigation is required and whether the landowner would prefer physical mitigation, such as a wooden noise barrier, or financial compensation in lieu of physical works. Once the second phase of the design-and-build contract commences, such agreements relating to physical mitigation measures can be finalised. It is expected that consultation on detailed mitigation matters&#8212;for example, the exact position and colour of noise barriers&#8212;will continue for approximately one year from the start of the second phase.</p><p>Along with the specific consultation with affected landowners, the promoter has undertaken that there will be more on-going general public consultation to ensure that the wider community is fully informed about the project's progress and any direct impact that it might have on their lives, such as road and footpath closures. That public consultation exercise is about to commence with a leaflet being issued to communities along the route, advising of the forthcoming ground investigation works that require to be carried out in <place-holder colnum=\"9838\"/> advance of the detailed design.</p><p>I am certainly encouraged by that, and I hope that the spirit of consensus that the promoter has expressed on paper converts into consensual working on the ground, meaning that objectors and other affected residents along the route are able to achieve appropriate measures to minimise the adverse effects of the railway during its construction and operation.</p><p>The members of our committee have been able to deal with the bill within a parliamentary year. Our committee has been working right through to the beginning of June, with extra meetings right up until the last minute to deal with matters such as the Balfour Street level-crossing and the River Teith candidate special area of conservation.</p><p>On a personal note, it is gratifying to see the rail network in central Scotland taking new, dynamic, shape. However, we in the north have to press the Scottish Executive to meet our rail needs next. While other central belt projects are on line, the Inverness to Aberdeen improvements are now urgent. I hope that the Aberdeen-based Minister for Transport, Nicol Stephen, will make that a priority of his. Those of us who live in the far north know that the routes to Inverness from the south and the north-east need to be in good condition if travellers are to be funnelled north. Since the lead time for planning, approval and parliamentary scrutiny is many years, we think that it is necessary to speed up the plans for the Inverness to Wick services and to get them into the next rail development plan, which is due to be published before 2007.</p><p>To return to the bill, in the light of the reports to the Parliament of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine Railway and Linked Improvements Bill Committee, I invite the Parliament to agree to the two motions in the convener's name.</p>", "hdate": "2004-07-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13322030", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine Railway and Linked Improvements Bill: Final Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There have been several useful and informed contributions to the debate and I take the opportunity to respond to some of the points that have been raised.

The other of the two women that the campaign concerned&#8212;Tanya Koolmatrie, who is from Australia&#8212;has been given a reprieve by the Home Office and is going to be able to stay with her family in Shetland.

Hazel Minn is <place-holder colnum=\"9156\"/> studying community work at Shetland College and hopes to carry out such work if she is allowed to stay. Her two children, who are Burmese speakers, have learned to speak in Shetland dialect at the primary school in Hillswick in the north of the island where they live. The family is welcomed by the whole community, as members can see from the fact that the petition carries the signatures of a third of the population.

It is important that we put our voices behind the campaign to allow them to stay. If members have not signed the petition against the deportation of families from Shetland, I will circulate it with a motion to help, because we should try to bring to bear all the pressure that we can on the Home Office in this case.

All these years later, it is obvious that he has changed his mind, as he is now in charge of it. In 1965, it was widely agreed that the best measure of success for the development board&#8212;which became Highlands and Islands Enterprise&#8212;would be the health of the remote mainland and island groups. While no one would compare the transformation of their economies and their state of mind with today&#8212;they are much better now&#8212;those groups remain the measure of the success or failure of the Government's policies, as set out in the motion. There is an endemic problem that is yet to be solved if 21 <sup>st</sup> century ambitions are to be satisfied.</p><p>The big question is about commitment by Government to take the principled steps that are needed and to admit that an enterprise agency is only as successful as the political will behind it. The policies in \"A Smart, Successful Scotland\" must embrace every community or the Executive will confirm the suspicion that, under this Administration, policies stop at Stirling, far short of Stromness and Stornoway, not to mention Wick, Golspie and Invergordon&#8212;the very areas on the mainland that suffer from poor economies and are not addressed by the motion.</p><p>The Government claims success in the development of telecommunications infrastructure, research and development, and renewables, but success in comparison with where? The umpteenth assurance that broadband will be rolled out was repeated two days ago. Jim Wallace hailed broadband's arrival in Kirkwall, but what about Stromness, where the cluster of learning and research businesses is deeply disappointed by the news that they must wait until next year to be globally competitive? When will they get broadband?</p><p>In the same part of Orkney, the research and development that is achieved at the European Marine Energy Centre is most welcome. There is potential to build a centre of excellence there, but one of the key players, Heriot Watt University, <place-holder colnum=\"8856\"/> which was part of the international centre for island technology, is ceasing to send its MSc degree students there. Further, Heriot Watt is withdrawing from its Borders campus to retrench in Edinburgh. Is that a message about spreading jobs in academia into the areas that need them? Will the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning do anything about that?</p><p>How is the Scottish Executive lobbying to keep a flow of European research projects coming to the nascent UHI and the existing faculty in Stromness? Will the European Commission's plans to favour a sort of ivy league of leading European institutions mean that small institutions in the Highlands and Islands will have difficulty in getting a flow of cash with which to build on the research and development that is vital if we are to use our wonderful natural and human resources properly?</p><p>The lack of strategic direction by the Scottish Executive with regard to renewables is a result of the fact that the Scottish Executive has control over only part of the issue. It must look to London for the rest, which means that it does not have its hands on all the levers of power. Interconnectors from the northern isles to the mainland or a ringmain in the north of Scotland are urgently needed. The ministers need to talk about when those facilities will be delivered and not just tell us that it will happen some time in the future. If wave and tidal power were in local hands, they would provide a steady income stream that would support new, sustainable jobs.</p><p>If our Highlands and Islands economy is \"good and getting better\", as James Hunter stated in his recent lecture, comprehensive policy development is essential. However, the real tests for such sustainable solutions are the issues of population growth and housing. In his chairman's report for 1999-2000, James Hunter stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need the people of this area to have confidence in cultures that were long disparaged and neglected. We need our communities to be empowered to take on the management of land and marine resources that were too long in the hands of outside interests. Most of all and fundamentally we need our folk to have the confidence to go into business on their own account.\"</p><p>How do we create that confidence? Low pay is endemic and disparities between men's pay and women's pay are marked. Moray is the worst area, followed by the remoter mainland and island areas where, as I was told this week, key administration staff in successful businesses would earn more as cleaners elsewhere.</p><p>Land reform is only beginning. In the crofting areas, one third of the Highlands and Islands, community buyouts are painfully slow. The vast majority of us have yet to hear how land can be <place-holder colnum=\"8857\"/> acquired cheaply for affordable housing in villages where planners will approve ecology-friendly designs and where young families do not get pushed out to the big centres as depopulation goes on by stealth, demoralising many people. Will the minister tell us how a comprehensive approach to affordable housing takes on all the things that Highlands and Islands Enterprise cannot do?</p><p>The Government must say how it will build community confidence based on a rich cultural inheritance and a vibrant, self-generated traditional arts scene and how it will put in place the means for families to flourish where they wish, especially in their home areas. We cannot build community support merely by bringing people into the Highlands. There is no social stability in that. The roots of our argument are that a vibrant economy in the Highlands must be built on the base of the communities that deserve this Government's support.

The small festivals that make up the bulk are the ones that most people take part in. It is probable that more people take part in festivals than take part in football and many other things like that; however, the kind of funding that is available for festivals is not nearly what it should be.</p><p>This month, I have appeared at f&#232;is Rois as a participant. I have also dipped into the Ullapool fish week and done some walking in the Caithness walking festival. Such small festivals attract people from other countries to take part in something that local people are themselves celebrating. I do not need to declare an interest, but I was an organiser of the Highland traditional music festival for more than 20 years. The problem is that festivals are usually run by volunteers who run out of steam eventually&#8212;or get elected to Parliament. Money is needed to back up the volunteers' administrative efforts to allow the festivals to be sustained and to <place-holder colnum=\"8689\"/> allow the volunteers to do more creative thinking and less of the drudgery.</p><p>However, the fact is that that money seems to be being used to fund the superstructure of the arts. Our amendment talks specifically about EventScotland, which has a chief executive on a salary of &#163;95,000 although it has not yet even published a business plan for staff, administrative costs and so on. People in many parts of the country will look at that kind of money and think about what &#163;95,000 could do to help sustain a hundred festivals around the country. Thanks to the Scottish Arts Council and careful discussions over the years, greater amounts of money have been given to festivals, but it has not been nearly enough to sustain many festivals in the face of today's cost increases. The question of whether EventScotland should exist is something that my colleague, Kenny MacAskill has argued about. I do not know whether we need it&#8212;in fact, I think that we should probably abolish it.</p><p>When we project our culture into the tourism market and onto a bigger stage, VisitScotland has an important part to play. However, I am sorry to say that it is not always as professional as it should be. For example, it has a policy called \"A Soundtrack for Scottish Tourism\", which is about promoting traditional music. Yet, at the VisitScotland expo 2004, which was held in Aberdeen last month&#8212;which the minister called one of the best that he had attended and which, as one of the industry's biggest business-to-business trade fairs, he described as \"a resounding success\"&#8212;VisitScotland did not take the opportunity to present a full showcase of Scottish traditional music. A package was offered but was not, in the end, bought. I am afraid to say that the hospitality package that the participants from all around the world got was a stop-gap measure, not the best that could be provided, because VisitScotland would not pay a reasonable amount for musicians of the top quality. That is the kind of thing that we hear about, although people do not want to discuss it too widely. People feel let down by the fact that organisations in which people have very large salaries do not, in the end, reflect the culture of Scotland.</p><p>It is on the culture of Scotland that I will finish. The motion gives no inkling of a strategy to project the best of our Scottish culture abroad. For example, will any part of the year of Highland culture be sent on tour around the world? It would be great if the minister could spell out such a strategy. We have to take a can-do approach to sending out cultural ambassadors, because that is a part of selling Scotland. I suggest that many people come to Scotland for our traditional culture because it can be found only here and they take that message back to their own countries and more people come here.

However, we need to dig deeper to uncover the politics of the issue. The Crofters Commission may well have a wish to change the crofting agenda. Where does that push come from? If the livestock improvement scheme is an impediment, is the aim to reduce the amount of cattle production in our remote mainland and island areas? If it is, that is a startling revelation. Are the tenets of the forward strategy for agriculture, which are so well met by the north-west Sutherland cattle producers, and the public goods that are already delivered by Shetland crofters, as acknowledged by the common agricultural policy mid-term review, to be set aside because many of those things are helped by the bull scheme?</p><p>People have extremely strong views about the move in the areas affected by the scheme and ministers must listen carefully to the experts in the marts, to the farmers and crofters and to the people who run the bull hire scheme. They know that they need to have a large number of bulls available to meet the conditions of transport to remote areas. They also know that, over the years, we have seen a steady improvement in all that has been produced. It worries me intensely <place-holder colnum=\"8576\"/> that we are left with an SAC report that comes down to issues such as value for money and the need</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to assess whether the objectives of the schemes are still valid and relevant to the Commissions agenda\",</p><p>as it says at the start of the report. What is that agenda? I think that the minister had better clarify whether he wants to reduce the number of cattle in the remote areas or is opposed to that.</p><p>I cite one example from the SAC report. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is some increase in group buying of bulls. There may be a trend towards both increasing use of the Commission hire scheme and buying of bulls for specific uses e.g. breeding replacements. Once again this points to a segmentation of the crofter market with some groups becoming sophisticated in terms of bull selection and others heavily reliant on the scheme.\"</p><p>That suggests to me that the actual conclusion is not about sophistication or otherwise, but about basic need in the most remote communities. Therefore, there is a definite need for a review of the debate with a cool head. People must take the issue away and think again about the fact that we used to have a partnership among the Crofters Commission, the Government and the crofters that ensured that the most remote areas were helped to service their economy by the scheme. At present, we have a big question mark.</p><p>Five Liberal Democrat and three Labour MSPs represent the Highlands and several of them are ministers. Surely they can put their heads together and get Ross Finnie to withdraw his remarks about the scheme being axed. The decision needs to be reconsidered. Across the parties, there is a belief that there are many ways forward by which we could ensure that the scheme meets the needs of remote and fragile communities. Indeed, the experts recognise that the scheme is the best way forward for the improved livestock of those areas. We must get away from talking about value for money and move on to the issue of value for sustainable communities.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318648", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Livestock Improvement Scheme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am a little surprised at John Scott's attitude to the debate, because it seems from the logic of what he said that he would have preferred that none of us turned up.

Few MSPs represent an area that has no coastline, so most of us should find it quite easy to do that.</p><p>I was able to survey the waters of the Pentland firth from Dunnet head last Monday, when the Caithness walking festival offered me an ideal site from which to reflect on that sea area, which sustains a large bird population of fulmars, guillemots and puffins, along with whales, dolphins and lots of other sea life. The firth narrows from eight miles at the west end to two seaworthy miles <place-holder colnum=\"8507\"/> at the east end, where three ferries ply across from Caithness to Orkney.</p><p>I also watched a large bulk carrier, which ploughed east towards the narrow channel into the North sea, like so many do and so many more could if the Scapa Flow international container hub is set up. In March 1999, an accident took place in those stormy narrow seas involving the chemical-carrying ship Multitank Ascania. That incident showed how congestion can lead to ecological disaster. The well-trained crew and emergency services dealt with the crisis, but not before an exclusion zone of 5km had been set up around the anchored, burning ship, which was full of vinyl acetate, and 600 local residents had been evacuated. It takes a very long time to sort out the environmental effects of marine disasters, which occur all along our coasts and right down to Spain. It also takes a long time to settle human affairs in such areas. A taxi driver told me yesterday that a cousin of his has just received compensation from the Braer disaster in Shetland. An overarching approach to marine affairs is required, so that such matters are better integrated.</p><p>I return to my view from Dunnet head. Across in Orkney, the marine energy test centre seeks to harness the tides and the waves. The white-fish landings at Scrabster are strong at the moment and lobster pot buoys are dotted along the sea close inshore. How are all those interests to be regulated and integrated, especially given that not far to the west lies the Dounreay nuclear decommissioning site, from which radioactive particles have historically washed on to beaches such as Sandside and swept through the Pentland firth by the strong currents, deep into North sea crevices?</p><p>Further west again are the maerl beds, which, at the Darwin mounds, the EU has begun to protect. However, those are not the only beds to have been dredged out. I am glad that at Lamlash, on Arran, a local attempt is being made to protect the undersea maerl beds from destruction. If we are to give people powers to offer such protection, we need to have an overarching view of how it should be done.</p><p>As many other members have noted, there is a plethora of laws and regulatory authorities. About 80 laws govern the cleanliness of our seas and beaches, navigation and fishing, but there is no strategic plan like the onshore plans for local authorities that are regularly updated to show their development and conservation aims. There must be offshore plans that link with those, because onshore activity can have devastating effects on nearby sea areas. It is essential that offshore planning is integrated with land use.</p><p>In the far north-west of Sutherland, the threat&#8212;however unlikely it is to be realised&#8212;that a <place-holder colnum=\"8508\"/> superquarry will be set up at Loch Eriboll is blighting the development of the loch for shellfish cultivation. Would-be shellfishers must sign a waiver noting the possibility that a superquarry will have an effect on the quality of the waters and that pier facilities may be required. Something must be done to resolve that situation, as the blight remains.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Crown Estate commissioners scoop up a steady income from developments beyond the high-water mark. Like the Royal Navy press gangs of the past, the CEC takes a toll on our resources, without locally elected people having any overall controls that would allow them to plan for and monitor the land and adjacent sea area. Offshore wind farms and tidal machines will also grease the palms of the CEC if we do not cut out those pirates who extort &#163;80,000 a year from the Cromarty Firth Port Authority, for example, thereby weakening its development potential.</p><p>Ports and harbours need funding to tackle accelerated low-water corrosion, which the Executive does not yet recognise as a huge national problem. These are coastal matters that relate to both land and sea. It should be noted that the nearby Cape Wrath area suffers from Ministry of Defence and NATO bombing and shelling exercises throughout the year&#8212;even into the tourist season, in early July&#8212;which can result in an increased number of dolphin and whale deaths, and much else besides. MOD rights of passage, the use of submarines and offshore exercises need to be included in the spatial planning of our sea areas and lochs.</p><p>The examples that I have given show that the consultation that is under way must go much further. Good governance and sustainable management require a national framework. We probably need a demonstration marine national park to show what can be done. Local decision-making powers are essential, but those can be created only if there are national powers of integration over all uses of the sea&#8212;as is evident from the area around Dunnet head.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marine Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "To explore the details of today's debate, it helps to have a particular sea view in mind when thinking about how an integrated marine policy should work.

If he is given time to speak, my colleague Adam Ingram will give an excellent example of the local control of beaches in Ayrshire, which could be a great help.</p><p>The results of the Marine Conservation Society's \"Beachwatch 2003\" report show a huge increase in pollution on our beaches&#8212;a 99 per cent increase since 1994, 29 per cent of which has occurred since 2002. Of the litter that was removed from a sample of 23 Scottish beaches, 31 per cent&#8212;about a third&#8212;was from beach visitors, 10.8 per cent was from fishing and marine sources, and 12.7 per cent was from sewage sources. A breakdown of where the litter comes from might answer part of Mr McGrigor's query.</p><p>How damaging are nuclear elements, such as technetium-99, which is discharged by Sellafield? How dangerous are plastic bags? How dangerous are the radioactive particles that are exposed on Sandside beach in Caithness? Such matter is not litter that can easily be removed, so we must measure not only the amount of radioactive material on the beaches but how dangerous it is for the people who use those beaches. The health risks that are associated with bathing take on an added dimension in that context.</p><p>We must reduce the amount of material that is put into the sea. My leader, John Swinney, visited the Irish Minister for Environment and Local Government in July 2003 to discuss the Irish Government's international court case that aimed to close down Sellafield, which is known to contribute 87 per cent of the collective radiation dose to EU member states through its discharges. We receive the first such doses. We cannot be self-congratulatory about that.</p><p>Furthermore, Kimo, the local authorities international environmental association, which is an organisation with which I have been associated in the past, has shown that seabirds have a lot of plastic in their guts. Much of that must be stopped and I hope that the Parliament will give local authorities more powers to deal with such matters.

The threat of blackouts, power cuts and so on is thrown up as a spectre&#8212;in the Scottish debate and in the wider debate.</p><p>Denmark set up an energy authority after the fuel crisis of 1973. If we had control of all energy in Scotland, we could have a similar overview and take a similarly comprehensive approach here. It is a pity that only renewables are under the direct control of the Scottish Executive.</p><p>We can encourage businesses, but the fact that we are fighting with one hand behind our back makes the situation more difficult than ever&#8212;especially given that WWF has suggested that 24,000 jobs could be created in renewables. That is a considerable prize in parts of the country that are job starved and in which there are low incomes. Those areas could be receiving much income at present.</p><p>People such as John Home Robertson and Brian Wilson on one side and Murdo Fraser and Alex Johnstone on the other have adopted the attitude that the nuclear option is clean. That argument has been put firmly in its place. Carbon emissions are not the only issue. If we measure the potential of offshore wave power against the costs of disposing of nuclear waste, we may find that offshore wind power is cheaper than many conventional forms of generation&#8212;and certainly cheaper than nuclear power. One problem that I have with the Unison briefing from which people who support nuclear power are so happy to quote is that it states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Renewable energy is actually more expensive than other forms of generation.\"</p><p>That is not the case if we take into account the problem of emissions from coal-fired power stations and nuclear waste. If we are to take a balanced view, we could do with having an energy authority to make some of the arguments.</p><p>The Government has made an excellent start on energy efficiency and the SNP is very supportive of it. Today, I lodged a motion on an excellent discussion at a conference in Caithness last week on the use of timber in buildings. The conference not only favoured local use of local materials, but recognised that many aspects of modern building could reduce the costs of energy. As the Green party has suggested, we could produce houses that are so energy efficient that they do not need to be heated. We can develop such approaches&#8212;they are part of housing policy, which must be part of energy development policy. We must ensure that energy development policy pays its way. I hope that the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning will respond to that point. The conference on tomorrow's houses today showed how we can build our way towards using less energy.<place-holder colnum=\"7732\"/></p><p>Community involvement concerns me a great deal. Some of the attitude problems that exist in many parts of the countryside result from the fact that people do not feel that they have ownership of the means of production of energy. Because the large utilities are seen as the main producers, there is immediate hostility to developments. Part of the problem is that the Government has not been speedy enough in putting community-controlled and community-developed energy in place. Highlands and Islands Enterprise was paid by National Wind Power to get its community unit going, but it took about five years for the community in which I live to receive any benefit. That effort must be matched by Scottish Enterprise, so that people can get in at the ground floor&#8212;either by acquiring proper levels of community benefit through planning gain or by acquiring equity shares in developments onshore and offshore. We would like to hear more on that issue.</p><p>SNH and non-governmental organisations on the environment support the provision of guidelines for the development of all renewables. As our amendment indicates, the SNP also supports that. However, it seems that the Government does not believe that central guidelines for such developments are needed. That is a great lack. I am sorry that there has not yet been explicit agreement to put in place guidelines that tell people exactly how they should proceed in these matters.</p><p>We should encourage support for developments by giving local people control, producing local benefits and creating local heating systems. Such initiatives are not high tech&#8212;they are innovative ways in which an ambitious Government should move. Existing large housing schemes could benefit from local heating systems. I believe that 60 per cent of housing in Denmark benefits from such systems, because they have been developed since the 1930s. Where were we when those things were being done?</p><p>Fundamentally, we should be more ambitious and take a grip of this issue, in so far as that is possible under the devolved settlement. In the Scottish context, renewables should be the main part of our energy production. I hope that the Government will reflect that energy by taking a grip of the subject and by putting renewable energy to the fore of energy production in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2004-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13316578", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The development of wave and tidal power&#8212;which has been long delayed by Tory Governments, by Labour Governments and by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority's fiddling of the figures for Salter's ducks, which has been admitted&#8212;has been held up.

The very low level of women members in the United Kingdom and United States legislatures suggests a reason for those countries' tendency to be more violent.</p><p>I wish to focus on one aspect of the liberation of women that has allowed them to have a far greater say in all democratic processes. With the single transferable vote in multimember constituencies, which could bring many different people into local government, it will not be a committee who chooses who will be at the top of the list; it will be up to the electorate to do so, using an open list&#8212;we hope. At least, that is how I view STV and multimember seats. It is an interesting prospect. So many women who are active in organisations in local communities would then get the recognition that they cannot get when they hit the glass ceiling over the smoke-filled rooms of party organisations.

I think that a lot of the aggression in here relates to the fact that we have very limited powers. We end up arguing over miniscule parts of what could be changed, rather than about the whole thing. Take poverty and social exclusion. We can deal with education, training, lifelong learning, child care, economic regeneration and so on in Scotland, but taxation, pensions, benefits, the national minimum wage, employment and equal opportunities legislation are reserved. How can we possibly deal with the full picture if we continually have to refer to another place? We must get things integrated.</p><p>In the north of Scotland, where I come from, many women are involved in organisations in the arts movement, including the f&#232;is. Many community organisations are run by women. That suggests to me that it is high time that we made it possible for many more women, be they in towns or in the countryside, to get the recognition for running housing co-operatives, food co-operatives, credit unions and so on. We need to clear the way for them to get the power and responsibility that councils and the Parliament can give.

She said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Giving every child in Scotland the best possible start in life is a top priority for the Scottish Executive.\"</p><p>If we are to resolve the issue of providing for people in the far-flung parts of Scotland who live in a geography that has been fixed and who rely on the Government to equalise its expenditure to make services work, Caithness has an extremely strong case. We must meet the needs of patients where they live and ensure that some form of consultant-led maternity service is maintained there. I believe that the many people who will watch the webcast of this debate expect the Parliament to ensure that the Executive provides a service that meets those needs.</p><p>Professor Calder reports against a background of low and decreasing birth numbers in the Caithness area, recruitment difficulties and wanting the delivery of the best possible services <place-holder colnum=\"6666\"/> that modern medicine can offer in small hospitals. Therefore, it is necessary for Highlands and Islands representatives to ask how we will provide the services that are needed in areas such as that in question, where there are 100 miles between the small Caithness hospital and Raigmore general hospital. How will we deal with such situations?</p><p>Professor Calder describes the situation in Caithness as being more acute than in any other part of Scotland. That said, we could find that the birth rate in Caithness increases in the future. We know that the birth rate in the countryside is better than it is in many cities. Indeed, if there were to be a dispersal of Government jobs and good reasons for people to stay in Caithness, many young families would want to bring up their children there, if they could. Many people who want to set up businesses want to know that a full service will be available in the area. Such a service attracts people to set up businesses in Caithness. If that service is put in jeopardy, there could be an economic downturn. I am delighted that Highland Council and Highlands and Islands Enterprise are doing an assessment that will give us an idea of the social and economic effects of the reduction in health services in our area.</p><p>The nub of the issue are the staff who would be recruited to work in maternity services. On the EGAMS report, Mary Mulligan said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We need to realise the full potential of our midwives ... We need to think across professional ... and organisational boundaries\".</p><p>I will dwell on those matters, which are at the heart of the argument.</p><p>We are used to the fact that not enough doctors are trained. The difficulty in obtaining consultants occurs in many countries, as well as in Scotland. It is a great difficulty in modern medicine, because of the way in which specialisation takes place, but we are asking for some out-of-the-box thinking. We are asking that consultants should be employed on a contract that allows them to keep up their competencies in a large hospital, such as in Inverness, and work in Caithness.</p><p>Midwives have said that they want to have more responsibilities. Since around two thirds of births ought to be reasonably uncomplicated, they could take on such responsibilities. However, examples flow from many other places to suggest that there must be consultant back-up when emergency caesarean operations are required. Professor Calder's report does not say how that should be delivered. It is mentioned, but the solution has to be found. It involves consultants working in Caithness who do not just deal with out-patients, and who have the skills to deal with the emergencies that can crop up.<place-holder colnum=\"6667\"/></p><p>Much play has been made of the distance from the hospital in Inverness. Rightly, the people of Caithness and north Sutherland feel that road journeys for expectant mums&#8212;over bad roads in what can be bad weather&#8212;should be deplored. If we were working in other countries, we might expect there to be more aircraft, such as helicopters, but we do not have the investment in those facilities in Caithness and the north. For example, we do not have a commitment to mend the second runway at Wick airport, so that aircraft can work in different weathers.</p><p>Above all, we do not have a commitment to get consultants to move to and work in Caithness, or to fly them in. It takes half an hour to set up a theatre for an operation and it takes half an hour to fly from Inverness to Caithness, so why not make it a central part of our argument for the future of maternity services in Caithness that services are consultant-led and that consultants are flown in as and when needed? Not every operation will require that, but people want to see that spelled out, and want to know what the minister is going to do to address the issues of geography and need that we face in the north of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13313579", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Maternity Services (Caithness)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is timely that this debate on maternity services in Caithness should take place this evening, as the Calder report has just been published and Highland NHS Board will meet in Wick next Tuesday to discuss the outcome of proposals that would, in effect, downgrade maternity services in Wick and Caithness general hospital.

Therefore, it is with some sadness that we see that the Government has not taken on board the argument that is made in the SNP's amendment. Our argument would help to fund and give new impetus to Historic Scotland; it is not a criticism of the Executive or the partnership. This is the first debate that has been held on this subject area, which requires a lot of investment. That is made obvious by the fact that there are some 46,000 listed buildings of special architectural interest in Scotland; 3,000 of those buildings are in the Highlands, which I represent. Historic Scotland controls and opens to the public only about 300 buildings, yet it controls the listing of many sites that are of major importance.</p><p>I declare an interest; as a member of the Andrew de Moray project, I submitted a petition during the first session of Parliament on this very subject. In presenting that petition to the Public Petitions Committee, I said that Historic Scotland needs</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to give greater publicity, interpretation and investment to sites and buildings of national importance\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Public Petitions Committee</em>, 23 January 2001; c 878.]</p><p>The petition was related to the wars of independence.</p><p>The nub of the debate is that we all have our pet projects that require investment. That has been clear in the speeches of members from all parties, which suggests that it would be a good idea for the minister to rethink his attitude to what the SNP is saying and to look for ways to have the audit of our historic environment backed up by a regular review of the issue. In that way, we could have a debate on the subject in Parliament at each stage of its development.</p><p>Frank McAveety encouraged us by saying that economic development was taking place and that there was a lot of work for the construction industry. We welcome that. Just think how much more work there could be if Historic Scotland had a bigger budget. Much more work could be created from rebuilding our historic heritage. In that respect, it is interesting&#8212;no-one has <place-holder colnum=\"6639\"/> mentioned this point, although it may have been mentioned in questions in the past&#8212;that some of the skewing of Historic Scotland's budget has meant that, for example, &#163;4 million has been spent on a new visitor centre at Urquhart Castle that is basically a viewing platform for the Loch Ness monster. What has that got to do with history? Has anyone established whether Urquhart Castle is an important part of our heritage, or whether some of that money ought to have been put into interpretation, signage, car parking and access for the many sites that are far more important to the national story?</p><p>Wide questions are raised by this debate. The question of restoring ruins, which Murray Tosh posed eloquently, is very much part of the debate that goes on in local authorities. As John Duncan, who is the planning conservationist for Highland Council, has suggested, our responsibility towards our built heritage goes beyond the simple prevention of its destruction. Above all, it means ensuring that the built heritage remains in active use as an integral part of the community. That sums up many of the arguments about historic buildings that have been treated badly in the past, such as Castle Tioram and others, which require urgent attention and investment. The SNP amendment addresses that issue directly.</p><p>Roseanna Cunningham mentioned the uneven funding&#8212;underfunding, in some cases&#8212;of projects. I have mentioned some examples of that. That underpins many of the problems that have been raised in the debate, and I hope that the minister will respond to the points that have been made. Our historic environment and cultural landscape ought to excite Scots families as it did 40 or 50 years ago, when people took their children to castles and explained something about them to them. If people are to do that now, Historic Scotland, when it produces material about individual castles&#8212;for example the booklet that I am holding, which is about Bothwell Castle&#8212;must relate the story to other buildings that are part of the same story, and not just to the neighbouring properties.</p><p>The SNP asks the minister to address the point about investment; to support our amendment, as he still has the chance to do; and to recognise that we need an audit with Historic Scotland at the helm.</p>", "hdate": "2004-03-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13313490", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This debate is of historic importance, because it is a first in terms of this huge area of national heritage.

After all, the many changes over the years have led people to lose heart in the NHS's claim that it puts patients at the core of its activities.

Because of our general communitarian spirit in Scotland, we believe that we can create a public structure that will put patients at its heart and that will in due course give them the confidence to feel that they can receive treatment where they need it.</p><p>The creation of CHPs will mean some centralisation, because in some of the remote places in the area that I represent local health care co-operatives were bedding in and working quite well. The islands have a separate set-up, because they are small enough to be coterminous with local authority boundaries; however, in the Highland Council area, that slight centralisation will require some staff regrading. Indeed, that might well be the case in some other health board areas and CHPs elsewhere. Some retraining will be required, so extra costs will be incurred. That is a small example of how aspects of the changes that cannot yet be quantified will test the system. I will return later to finance.</p><p>I agree with Unison that front-line staff and people who deliver the services will have much more of a say within the proposed structure.

Health boards are being given responsibilities in health promotion, but NHS Scotland must provide benchmarks and targets for other departments, whether in food production or in the various means by which we ensure that the population has a healthy life. Health promotion is an exciting area and I welcome its potential. However, it must cut across other departments and the health service must take a strong lead.

Because it is a rotational crop, the trials may be repeated regularly. It is possible, then, to ask whether more of the sewage sludge will be imported at every stage in the replanting or prior to new trials. Part of the problem seems to be that quite a large amount of sludge is required. We understand that between 5,000 and 7,000 tonnes would be laid per hectare, in comparison with 250 tonnes per hectare in Blairingone.

The Government has a duty to ensure that people's access to it is facilitated. It is a theme of mine throughout that one of the ways of meeting the targets that have been set is to ensure that each of the different players can operate in tune. In evidence, the Environment and Rural Development Committee was given examples that suggested that that might be in doubt.<place-holder colnum=\"5014\"/></p><p>Local authorities must create integrated waste management plans, which require ministerial approval. A significant number of authorities have secured that approval, but others have not. In the areas where waste management plans are awaiting approval, the process cannot be started. That is one of the elements that will make it difficult to meet the targets. In a moment, I will provide an example of that.</p><p>It is important to recognise that the voluntary sector has done a great deal to start the education process. Nora Radcliffe spoke about that to some extent and made the point that the sector, which relied on landfill tax funds, should not be left behind. It is important that it does not lose out in future and has access to the strategic waste fund. There are several hoops through which it must jump; we would like to reduce the number of those.</p><p>Maureen Macmillan referred to ILM (Highland), whose work involves the recycling, repair and reuse of white goods, notably for the Homestart scheme in the inner Moray firth area. ILM (Highland) has been in operation for only a short while. Having accrued funds, it must await various stages of approvals from the Highland Council and other bodies before it can get going. It is essential that it does get going, because the Homestart project will not only meet the Highlands' requirement under the European waste electrical and electronic equipment directive to recycle 4kg of waste per person by 2006 but, on the back of that, create six full-time jobs and 17 training places. Having visited the ILM plant in the Alness area, which is being very much helped at the moment, I know that those involved in Homestart very much welcome the white goods that have already been received. Many other areas and groups of less well-off people can benefit from such schemes, which is why it is so important to get the whole plan integrated.</p><p>Karen Whitefield mentioned the problems of Greengairs. I am quite sure that members from throughout the country are concerned that landfill must be controlled&#8212;another job for local authorities. As was put poignantly, the conditions that are placed on the companies that operate such sites are at times difficult to control. The committee's report seeks to find ways in which the Executive can tighten up how the companies in that sector operate. We look forward to seeing how that is developed.</p><p>Many of the recommendations may be applied at the local level. Roseanna Cunningham spoke of the cost to the public of having their waste taken away to be recycled, reused or whatever else. In the past&#8212;before my time&#8212;people used to collect jam jars to get into the pictures. In my days, I have to admit that we used to collect screwtop beer or <place-holder colnum=\"5015\"/> lemonade bottles and return them to shops, which was another way of getting small amounts of pocket money. Those excellent approaches to reuse from the past must be encouraged by regulation, so that glass of a thick enough gauge is used to manufacture bottles in the future. We know about the problems that existed with milk bottles in the past. Nevertheless, people do like to get their milk in bottles. If we could create conditions in which people have to use glass that is not of such a light weight that it cannot be reused, that would be very useful.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13309193", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Waste Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The vast majority of speakers have contributed to a very interesting debate.

That element has not been considered in the debate.</p><p>The one-size-fits-all approach to consultants' work will not fit Scotland's conditions. I am sorry that members of the other governing party, which represents so much of the central belt of Scotland, are not here to take part in the debate in the numbers that they might have been. Jean Turner has told us that, in some ways, the rural areas of Scotland might have to start helping out the cities. People should recognise that rural areas are not peripheral and that we have excellent health facilities and long experience of working with communities.</p><p>It is not unreasonable to ask the Government to consider means whereby patients can be moved to, for example, the Belford hospital to be treated, but it is much more reasonable to ask that medical staff be taken on with a suitable contract and given transport to go to places where the jobs need to be done. It is my fervent hope that we will receive the Government's support in ensuring that consultants fit the needs of the geography of our country.

A speedy improvement of our homes would have an impact on the confidence of Scots in the work of the Scottish Parliament. It would also be a measure of the effectiveness of the Government that has made the proposals that are under debate today.</p><p>I can say bluntly that in my part of Scotland the availability of affordable and warm housing can make the difference between families and single persons staying in the area to make a contribution to community life and our local economy, or emigrating. Progress must be measured regularly and carefully in order to sweep away the constraints on improvement and on provision of 21<sup>st</sup> century homes. Although 70 per cent of Scots are owner-occupiers and owner occupancy is the aspiration of the majority, we must ensure that the development of mixed tenure and various types and densities of housing are enabled by the Government's plans.</p><p>I participated recently in the local structure plan process in Easter Ross. It is clear to me that encouragement of owners to undertake regular maintenance of their homes is critical. That is especially the case given our aging population. Older people are sometimes unable to deal with the rapids of the house improvement process. I hope that the Government will make it possible for local authorities to create one-stop shops that could help to reduce the bewilderment and fear that some older people have of the house improvement process. Closer scrutiny needs to be given to that issue.</p><p>Many of the materials that were used in the <place-holder colnum=\"4695\"/> 1970s and 1980s for building houses were of poorer quality than those that are used today. Many of the materials that were used in private homes were of poorer quality than those that were used in building council housing stock. Any election canvasser can see the difference in quality between council houses that have been maintained, and private houses that have not. The report highlights that matter; it is an issue on which we are keen to see progress.</p><p>The recommendations of the housing improvement task force in respect of the responsibility for the upkeep of houses are most welcome. If we look at the guidelines for improvements, extensions and new build, we see that there is an urgent need for national guidance to encourage positively the use of local materials, high insulation factors and new designs that are fit for this century. I am delighted that planning advice note 67 on housing quality concentrates on those areas.</p><p>When one visits places like Shetland, however, it is possible to see the Scandinavian-style houses that were built for public housing needs. We could do with a Viking invasion of the mainland, which would ensure that we get that quality of insulation in the houses that are built in our areas. Unfortunately, in the Highland Council area, we are faced with planners who state in planning policy guidelines about housing in the countryside:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Design, siting and material finishes must respect the traditional vernacular architecture and adhere to the objectives of national guidance.\"</p><p>We need national guidance that encourages the use of materials such as timber, which is readily available. Timber construction has become a major issue in many rural areas because planners are turning down time and again the kind of innovative designs that would provide houses with high insulation value that we require in this century.</p><p>The availability of land for creating modern settlements and appropriate housing for families, the disabled, single parents and pensioners is a major equal opportunities issue. Moreover, given that access to a wholesome water supply is the second largest category in the below-tolerable-standard surveys, we must ask the minister to ensure that Scottish Water and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency are both fully on board in the drive to modernise our housing stock. In many rural areas, those agencies currently have a veto over new house building, over solutions to the obvious need to minimise the costs of supplying wholesome water and over the best means of removing and treating sewage. Housing is very much tied up with those issues and the private sector is as much involved as the public sector.<place-holder colnum=\"4696\"/></p><p>My final point links to my previous remarks about Scandinavian levels of insulation. The biggest group of homes in the below-tolerable-standard survey are those with poor standards of thermal insulation. The 1920s stone-built council houses in the Caithness area of Highland Council are being reclad to include cavity walls and roof insulation. Moreover, the council will ensure that, by the end of the year, many of those houses will also have double glazing. However, we really need a lead from the Government to improve quality and make our homes in the north the envy of the country, rather than their being its tail-end. That is why the time scale and the necessary resources that the SNP amendment calls for are expected by the public and should be welcomed by the minister.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308623", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate on improving Scotland's homes.

However, aspects of the bill will have to be clarified. Part of the committee's work involved asking 20 questions of the minister over the Christmas break. Unfortunately, the minister's answers so far do not match nearly 10 of those questions. Further answers on what are perhaps more tetchy points will need to be given before we move to stage 2. As a member of the committee, I would welcome some of those answers.</p><p>The first question, which has been raised by Roseanna Cunningham, Sylvia Jackson and others, concerns the biodiversity framework. The minister said that the framework was about changing attitudes and that the process would be participatory. It would be interesting if the framework could be set before the public in the same fashion as all other frameworks and laid out as a national planning policy guideline. In that way, people would know exactly what to expect in the framework. The bill will need to lay out in clear detail how the framework will be stated. I hope that the minister will give us more detailed answers on that than he has until now.</p><p>Criticisms have been levelled at SNH for its not being involved enough with communities. SNH must become more transparent and the bill gives it a great opportunity to do so; several members have mentioned that. The key to that is discussed in the committee's stage 1 report. The development of local sites would allow common standards to be developed. The biodiversity strategy would include those local sites and all the country would have a chance to take part in the process of valuing our wild land and wild species. SSSIs are often a considerable distance from where most of the population live, so the development of local sites could be seen by people as a means whereby they too could be involved. Whether that can be done will be a test of SNH.</p><p>We are approaching a better definition of the statutory purpose of SSSIs, but we will want to firm that up at stage 2. We will await developments.<place-holder colnum=\"4554\"/></p><p>An area that has been controversial during the debate relates to clashes between the evidence that was given by SNH and that which was given by the Deer Commission for Scotland, and to the reality of the increasing deer numbers in Scotland. I was one of the questioners during the evidence sessions and it is clear that the Deer Commission for Scotland has not used its section 8 powers because they are too complex.

For those members who have taken a keen interest in the bill, it is important to realise that the thorough work that was done by the committee extends to giving answers to some of the points that have been raised&#8212;or at least I hope that it does.</p><p>I will first respond to the question of the need for a private bill. It stems from the Railway Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845, which shows that rail is among the oldest forms of public transport. Indeed, given the methods for dealing with the creation and reopening of a railway in this day and age, cross-party effort to bring that about quickly would be welcomed by the committee and, I am sure, by all members.<place-holder colnum=\"4269\"/></p><p>The specific statutory authorisation of the bill is required because of the public or private nuisance that could arise and because the project involves the compulsory purchase of land. Several members raised that matter and it is important to clear it up at this point.</p><p>We are glad to hear from the minister that, alongside the private bill, consideration will be given to a link to Rosyth and on to Dunfermline, which was raised by several members. That link would open up the north side of the Forth and I am sure that the committee would welcome it. Our remit, however, restricts us to dealing with the issues that are raised specifically in the bill.</p><p>I will add to the response that the minister made to Sylvia Jackson's question on the Motherwell to Stirling rail link. Network Rail's submission confirmed that careful timetable planning is anticipated on that link. Network Rail could see no reason why the addition of coal traffic along the route that the scheme proposes would have a detrimental effect on current passenger or freight timetables. The committee will keep that issue under consideration.</p><p>Scott Barrie asked about alternative routes in the Kincardine area. We should point out that, at the preliminary stage, the committee is concerned with the general principles of the bill. It is also concerned about the adequacy of the information that is provided by the promoter to allow it to undertake more detailed scrutiny at the consideration stage. The promoter commissioned the Kincardine bypass, the Clackmannan bypass and the Bogside alignment options. We limited our consideration to the methodology that had been employed by the promoter in commissioning those appraisals and did not examine the merits of each alternative. I know that that answer might not satisfy Scott Barrie, but he has options in the future.</p><p>Brian Monteith made points about compensation for members of the public who are affected. Negotiations over compensation claims are a matter for the promoter and for individual objectors. Any compensation disputes are a matter for the Scottish Land Court to resolve.</p><p>With regard to the biodiversity action plans and so forth, all the supplementary information is available in the public domain through the Parliament's website and, of course, through our partner libraries. I hope that members will commend the libraries to their constituents.</p><p>It is important to recognise at this stage that the MSP whose constituency is most affected by the bill&#8212;George Reid, the member for Ochil&#8212;could not participate in the debate because he is also the Presiding Officer. Mr Reid is in regular contact locally with the sponsor and the objectors. I <place-holder colnum=\"4270\"/> confirm that Mr Reid has referred their concerns to the convener and me. Those concerns will be given full consideration if there is a positive preliminary stage vote tonight.</p><p>In those circumstances, I anticipate that the committee will thoroughly examine the needs case that has been put forward by Clackmannanshire Council that it will examine the objectors' concerns about compensation costs and the whole issue of sustainable development.</p><p>In reply to a specific question that was asked, I say that we are well aware that 55 objections cover over 300 signatures and that that has been taken into consideration.</p><p>I will outline the next stages in the unique procedure that a private bill requires. The bill goes next to the consideration stage, which is the second of three stages in the process. The overall purpose of a consideration stage is to consider the detail of the bill. There are two distinct phases in that stage that are distinguished by the style of the proceedings. The first will involve the committee meeting in a quasi-judicial capacity to hear evidence on the bill and objections to it. The second will involve the committee meeting in a legislative capacity to consider and dispose of any amendments, some of which could be as a result of the evidence considered on the objections. At the beginning of the first phase, the committee must agree from whom to invite evidence and whether to invite from each group oral evidence, written evidence or both.</p><p>The committee has only limited discretion about whom to invite. It must invite the promoter, but with objectors, the committee will first need to group those objections that it considers to be the same or similar and then for each group select one or more objectors to lead evidence on the group.</p><p>For the purpose of groupings, objections will normally be treated as similar only if they give similar reasons in opposition to similar aspects of the bill. That is important to note. That ensures that all legitimate arguments in respect of the bill are considered while avoiding unnecessary repetition. In relation to the remaining objections&#8212;those we cannot or choose not to group&#8212;we must invite to give evidence every objector whose interests we believe would be adversely affected by the bill.</p><p>As Bill Butler mentioned in his opening speech, 55 admissible objections were lodged against the bill, although 52 remain outstanding. Should the Parliament agree the motion today, the committee will prepare a timetable for the hearing of evidence. We hope to start the process next week with our first consideration stage meeting, at which we intend to group the objections&#8212;assuming that <place-holder colnum=\"4271\"/> the Parliament approves the motion on the financial resolution, which is down on the business programme for next Wednesday.</p><p>At consideration stage, the committee's role is to act as an arbiter between the promoter and the remaining objectors. That will involve allowing differences between the parties to be resolved by negotiation and, where that is not possible, choosing between them.

At the outset of the May election campaign, the First Minister, Jack McConnell, was asked on television whether he would seek more powers for the Parliament in the coming four years. His answer was that it does not need more powers and that it must use the powers that it already has. That was predictable, for it was Jack McConnell who, as the voice of the Labour party, told the Scottish Constitutional Convention, \"We have decided that you can't have control of personal income tax and VAT. We are going to stick with the block grant.\" Is it any wonder that the \"No change; no more power\" message delivered Labour's lowest vote since 1931, with a record low turnout of 49 per cent of voters? It is no wonder that the Electoral Commission is concerned. The commission reported that voter participation in the May 2003 Scottish elections</p><p class=\"indent\">\"leaves all those concerned with elections and electoral processes with a serious challenge.\"</p><p>There is further evidence of disillusionment. In 1999, 41 per cent of voters believed that the Scottish Parliament</p><p class=\"indent\">\"had the most influence over the way Scotland is run.\"</p><p>That figure has fallen to 24 per cent. Indeed, 57 per cent of the electorate believe that the Parliament has made</p><p class=\"indent\">\"no difference to the way Scotland is governed.\"</p><p>Is not that evidence enough to support a review of this young Parliament's powers?</p><p>Yesterday evening, Patricia Ferguson rejected an SNP move to debate the European constitution&#8212;a crucial issue for our fisheries and energy policies and for much else. She claimed that the SNP always seeks to have debates about</p><p class=\"indent\">\"issues over which the Executive has absolutely no control.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2003-12-03.3880.6\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 3 December 2003; c 3881.]</citation></p><p>Five years into the life of this young Parliament, it seems that Patricia Ferguson is unworried that <place-holder colnum=\"3934\"/> she and her Cabinet colleagues have discounted Donald Dewar's pledge at the Parliament's opening ceremony, when he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are fallible. We will make mistakes\"&#8212;</p><p>who will ever admit those, I wonder?&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"But we will never lose sight of what brought us here: the striving to do right by the people of Scotland; to respect their priorities; to better their lot; and to contribute to the commonweal.\"</p><p>If the majority of electors and the majority of members of the Scottish Parliament believe in their hearts and heads that we need full financial powers, when will Mr McConnell and company start to listen? Will they even heed their boss down south? Tony Blair told the Estonians:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Making everyone follow the same tax rules would quickly diminish Europe's competitiveness by killing jobs and stifling growth.\"</p><p>Is that not what we are experiencing in Scotland?</p><p>We make the case again and again, because the emigration trail shows not only that our remote islands and Highlands are losing young people, but that the flight from the cities is blighting the nation's future. Those young people know&#8212;as do our farmers, fishermen and hospital patients&#8212;that the psychology of denial makes us pay a high price for an incomplete financial settlement.</p><p>Thousands of people turned out in Fort William to protest, and hundreds have already protested in Caithness, about the imminent downgrading of consultant-led hospitals. Those protesters are demanding that the underpowered Government wakes up. We need bigger levers&#8212;as that sensible Tory, Alex Johnstone, has put it&#8212;if we are to do anything about the situation, so that the modest medical demands in far-flung parts of the country can be met.</p><p>We need an end to the blame culture that our having partial powers creates. People say, \"Oh, it's the quango's fault,\" or they say that it is the fault of the health board, Scottish Water or the European Union. No; it is the lack of financial clout, stupid.</p><p>This year we have been able to see how other countries use the flexibility of tax-raising, as well as tax-spending, powers. Let us consider the north of Norway. Norway is intent on retaining its population in the north and on ensuring that those people are supported so that they can have a vibrant way of life. Mothers receive higher child benefits and students who return to the area have their loans paid off more quickly. That tax flexibility to bring in such incentive taxation and targeted spend flows from having full financial powers.</p><p>In Scotland, our inflexible and shrinking block grant produces wooden responses. Just because it was decided in 1996 does not mean that it must <place-holder colnum=\"3935\"/> stay that way forever&#8212;as Lord Robertson said at the time. When will the Executive wake up and listen to the people, who say that they want Scotland to have more powers? Frankly, it is time that the Executive started to answer that point.</p><p>It is a harsh judgment on the underpowered nature of the Executive and its stubborn refusal to seek full financial powers that so many of our brightest seek a future elsewhere. It is a harsh judgment that fewer and fewer voters bother to turn out because they do not believe that to do so will make any difference.</p><p>Surely, we should consider the potential to push the levers full on. We should meet the people's real priorities and give this place full financial powers to decide Scotland's future. At present, all that we are left with is the opportunity to deal with the block grant. That is not a future for Scotland; it is the past.

We cannot emphasise these issues too often. As a result of hearing about Strathaven last year, our local community attempted to discuss the question of the businesses in our village using Fairtrade produce. However, it became obvious that, in our fragile economy, people find it difficult to buy Fairtrade products. I am glad that the Co-op might make that easier in some cases, but other Fairtrade products are much more difficult to get&#8212;I am thinking of the basic products that people who run tea rooms require.</p><p>In our initial discussions with people, we found that the fragile state of our local economy made people less than willing to have a go. I hope that we can ask those people to rethink their approach and join in with what Edinburgh is doing just now and what Strathaven has already done. However, people in Edinburgh itself will find it impossible to run their small businesses unless they get the cheapest products.</p><p>That is the nub of the problem both at home and abroad. The idea of fair trade is hampered by the neo-liberalism that has narrowed down both the <place-holder colnum=\"3403\"/> number of products and people's choice and which has excluded many of the most vulnerable people that we are speaking in support of tonight. It is important to recognise that, in the first place, farmers must be able to choose to do what they want to do. After all, sustainable farming offers the degree of quality that consumers demand and involves a social dimension, economic efficiency and respect for consumers and nature. It is up to those of us who seek a fair price for coffee produced by people in developing countries to ensure that they, too, can practice sustainable farming, as I am sure they would wish to. Indeed, the fact not only that can we do our bit with the money in our pockets but that, through international organisations, we can allow people to choose sustainable farming methods brings the issue of added value into the debate.</p><p>In a week in which there has been much emphasis on international affairs, we must recognise that with all the debates on war, on having a more peaceful world and indeed on having a world where trading is freer, the free part of that trade must genuinely be free. We must not have the kind of free trade that we had in the 1980s. As a result, I recommend that people listen to this debate and take home to every part of the country the ideas that have been raised. We must recognise that, as Jos&#233; Bov&#233; and Fran&#231;ois Dufour have said, the world is not for sale and it is up to us to ensure that the quality products that farmers produce reach the consumers who want them.</p><p>I am also glad that the issue of transparency was mentioned earlier in the debate and I underline the fact that transparency in all aspects of purchasing, production, processing and sale of agricultural produce is a key part of free trade. However, although that forms part of the French peasants confederation's sustainable farming agenda, I do not see it necessarily forming part of Scotland's forward strategy for agriculture.

It is one of the biggest changes that has ever been brought about in farming in my lifetime and it is most welcome.<place-holder colnum=\"3077\"/></p><p>However, the devil is in the detail. The minister must give us some cast-iron guarantees in relation to how we support people in our less favoured areas. I know that it is early in the consultation for him to do so, but he should give us some indications today. For example, how will he ensure that suckler cows can still be produced in Orkney, Caithness or the crofting areas? I hope that he will talk about such examples today.</p><p>The policy has to address the problems of depopulation in rural areas. Highland Council is addressing the population time bomb with which we are threatened in the Highlands because of the considerable difficulties that the problem causes. Keeping people in the hills and glens does not fit with the easy definitions and solutions of the NFU at its top echelons, which are to go straight for decoupling, no modulation and all the rest of it. We have to get real about the fact that Scotland is a country with a difficult climate and a difficult geography.</p><p>I have to declare an interest as a member of the Scottish Crofting Foundation. I am obviously interested in supporting what that body says. I have also taken advice from farmers and crofters throughout our area in order to make these remarks. The SCF says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A reduction in agricultural activity and an overall fall in livestock numbers in the Highlands and Islands has been predicted\".</p><p>Last year, Ross Finnie said in the chamber that that could mean a downturn in activity. If one job is lost on the croft or farm, that can lead to three further job losses downstream. That is precisely the kind of issue on which we need guarantees, so that we can prevent it from happening. Locally, we have seen problems with the state veterinary service, which has reduced employment. We have also seen a cutting away at the economy in the most remote areas. We must ensure that the CAP reform benefits all the communities of Scotland and not just the best-off farming sector.</p><p>I have suggested that we need to ensure that modulation is targeted in such as way as to help those who are most in need. Colleagues in the north and in the marginal areas have said that they hope that some detail can be put on the figures that have been given so far. Indeed, at the beginning of her opening speech for the SNP, Roseanna Cunningham asked the minister for some detail on the figures. The minister has to spell out the sort of rural development schemes that have the potential to be used with modulation. We need to know about the practicality of applying some of the schemes that are available through the CAP reform.</p><p>I said earlier that the devil is in the detail. We are concerned about issues such as the historic payments that were made under the sheep annual <place-holder colnum=\"3078\"/> premium in 2001. The payment was low because, although the price of lamb in the UK was low that year, lamb prices were high in other parts of the European Union. We would like to press to have that low figure discounted in the process of averaging out the historic payments.</p><p>There is also concern that thousands of acres that have not been registered for IACS will suddenly become available when large sporting estates put a few sheep on to fields in order to qualify for good agricultural and environmental conditions and to apply for single farm payments. We would like to know whether such a scam can be ruled out.</p><p>We also want the minister to listen to the population out there. People are asking for a food policy that allows the Scottish public to buy food that is produced in our hills and glens. Although I am glad that the minister has brought in stakeholder groups to discuss the matter, he must ensure that consumers and others have a good deal more of a say than some of the usual suspects among the producer groups.</p><p>Although we generally support the agreement, the forward strategy for agriculture has to marry the potential for farmers and crofters to produce food with the ability of the people of Scotland to buy it.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13304522", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Agricultural Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In general terms, the SNP welcomes the CAP reform.

Those sums are considerable, but need in rural areas is disguised. We have not talked about the Scottish index of multiple deprivation, but it must be taken into account. It is one of the indices that allow particular forms of public spending to be allocated, but it is not disaggregated enough to be able to show actual need in rural areas. The Government must take on board the fact that many of the funding packages have taken into account neither the extra costs of living in the countryside nor the degree of rural deprivation, which is hidden in some of the figures that have been produced. The SNP wants to see a much more transparent approach being taken to the provision of figures on deprivation, to spend the correct amount of money in rural areas.</p><p>We need to have an explicit statement about the democratic deficit in decision making.

Health boards also have to deal with all of the nitty-gritty problems which, for health boards in remote and rural areas such as the Highlands where I come from, mean that they will have to deal with the problem of finding enough locums to take up the posts that will become vacant when doctors opt out of the out-of-hours service.</p><p>Member after member has identified pressure points, so between now and next April, the minister should give Parliament regular progress reports on implementation of the contract. Perhaps the minister who is to reply to the debate can tell <place-holder colnum=\"2671\"/> us about the means by which that could be done. Ministers need to allay the fears of the voters out there, who are the people who receive GP services. This is such a big change and people ought to know the parameters of the change as it goes along.</p><p>Some GPs to whom I have spoken talk about a chaotic service, about their concerns about the present state of change and about the pressure to change out-of-hours services. Let us consider what patients might face in the case of an opt-out by their local GP. Those patients might be dealt with by a paramedic, a nurse, a pharmacist, another GP practice&#8212;if there happens to be one on the islands on which some patients live&#8212;by NHS 24 or by the accident and emergency unit of the local hospital. We are in the midst of massive change, which is destabilising the service that people receive.</p><p>Like most members, I support the bill generally. However, the detailed negotiations that are going on mask the fact that although the regulations are expected to tell us a good deal more of the detail, real problems could prevent delivery of any kind of guarantee that the patient will get the same level of service that they receive at present&#8212;not that the level of service was as adequate as it should have been in every case.</p><p>Remote and rural areas and the inner cities face the biggest difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. That being so, during the process of change, the minister had better be able to tell us that a good deal more GPs are to be trained and students recruited into the service than has been the case up to this point. To be frank, the levels of increase are nowhere near what will be required to carry the out-of-hours service.</p><p>The cost of locums and the cost of the kind of private companies that are getting together to provide out-of-hours services is enormous. The Scottish Association of Health Councils has expressed concern about the enormous problems in the way in which the changes could impact on patients.</p><p>I will deal with one final point because of the short time that is available to me. We look to primary care to deliver public health principles and we ask GPs to try to deal not only with sickness, but to encourage health. Problems could arise in respect of the additional services that are to be met by payments for tests such as high blood pressure, diabetes and the like. However, will there be time for services that deal with mental health problems, which are not so easy to test for? After all, in 90 per cent of such cases, the point of contact is a GP.

In 1967, I saw the Citizen's Theatre production of \"The Anatomist\" by James Bridie. Many such works are performed in theatres around the country. The idea of a commissioning theatre is absolutely correct, because our national theatre has to create the kind of works that are in the canon of Scotland's great theatrical heritage.</p><p>I am surprised to hear some people say that Scotland does not have a theatrical heritage, because that heritage goes back a long way. In the modern world, that heritage has helped to carry the aspirations of our people to have a distinctly recognised culture. The new national theatre has to be able to match up to that.</p><p>The minister said that there would be a commitment right across Scotland; he will have to consider how existing theatre companies can fit into our new aspirations. There has been a flourishing of Highland theatre in the past 10 years&#8212;Mull Theatre, the Gaelic theatre company Tosg, and also the Grey Coast Theatre Company in Caithness have produced original works that should be seen throughout Scotland. Some of their productions have already been seen abroad. However, the way in which theatre is structured at present means that touring money for companies from the far north is almost non-existent. The split in the organisation of Highlands and Islands Enterprise's offshoot HI-Arts&#8212;Highlands and Islands Arts Ltd&#8212;which has a budget for some touring, means that it is almost impossible to take more than one tour out of the Highlands every year. It could cost &#163;120,000 or &#163;130,000 for Grey Coast to tour the central belt.</p><p>If the national theatre is to address the kind of problems that existing regional theatre has, it will have to find the funding to allow excellent plays such as the kind that George Gunn has produced <place-holder colnum=\"2142\"/> over the past 10 years. I am thinking particularly of \"Farm Land\", which I saw recently, and \"51 Pegasus\". Those productions tackle universal issues and ask challenging questions about emigration. They would be relevant in Lanarkshire, in Dumfries or wherever in Scotland. To make plays like those available in the context of the national theatre will require rejigging of current funding. Ideas will have to develop: commissioning can attempt to revisit some of our classics, but it should also provide for new productions of some of the excellent work that has been produced in Scotland in recent times, but which has had only limited audiences.</p><p>If small companies such as Grey Coast have been able to make international contacts with the likes of the National Theatre of Iceland, and if Scottish work can be performed in Brittany, Ireland or Norway, we will have to consider the capacity of the national theatre to enhance that existing work as well provide for the new items that will be commissioned in due course.</p><p>I ask the minister to consider carefully how the national theatre's creative budget will be used to try to release works of the sort that I have mentioned. They are part of the reason why it is now possible for us to say that we can have a vibrant theatre for Scotland. We will miss out on many of the artists who could allow Scotland's national culture to flourish if they are not involved, or if they are not liberated from their present financial constraints. We should try to stop the culture brain-drain from Scotland. The smaller companies must be fitted into the national theatre concept.</p><p>In the past, people have been forced to go and work in England, America or wherever. I was tempted to say at the beginning of the whole debate on the national theatre that people such as David Niven were the sort of Scots who went to America. However, there are also plenty of people in this generation who have been forced abroad.</p><p>Can we ensure that people who take a course on touring theatre&#8212;such as that offered at the North Highland College in Thurso, which will eventually become a degree course&#8212;will be able to find jobs in the national theatre?

Apart from a few that have been designed for the purpose, the buildings do not lend themselves to allowing teachers to maintain contact with a child when that child is excluded or removed from the classroom to enable intervention to take place so that they behave differently when they come back into the classroom.</p><p>Exclusion is a removal. The disruption of the learning process for the majority in the classroom is a major issue and the disruption for individual who has been removed is never overcome. In that situation, a spiral of decline develops. That is a fundamental part of the problem in secondary schools. In teacher training colleges, such issues were rarely addressed properly for many decades up to the present.</p><p>The teachers who will be recruited come from the modern society with which we now deal. They, too, may be disaffected. Most of us know what disruptive behaviour is like because we have been involved in it as pupils. We may have been disruptive in a mischievous way when we were young, but in some cases the cause may have been low self-esteem&#8212;who knows? Perhaps some people's self-esteem improved as they <place-holder colnum=\"1996\"/> became adults. However, we must recognise that in the classroom the system will always be tested by pupils, whatever their age. Teachers must be able to cope with a situation in which children want to kick over the traces, even for a short time.</p><p>If the long-term, comprehensive approach is to be effective, we must find the skills and time to give teachers the experience to pick up new ways of dealing with disruptive behaviour. Robin Harper said that we have a well-trained work force. We have a work force that is allowed to spend more time on training that may be targeted more specifically by the system than it was before, but the question whether teachers are better trained to deal with the circumstances that they have to confront remains unanswered.</p><p>My experience is that some of the best initiatives have come from individual schools and teachers. They include the anti-bullying strategy from St John's Town of Dalry and the buddying system that we learned about in videos from Perth High School. That good practice was cascaded throughout the country, but it did not emanate from teacher training colleges or elements of the formal training that the system provided. The minister will have to ask very searching questions of the system and provide us with some more specific answers today.</p><p>The range of support services in the classroom may be increasing, but because we have identified many more things that make it difficult for children to learn we will have to include in teacher training the means to deal with those. I am glad to hear that some of the initiatives to which Marlyn Glen and Sylvia Jackson referred are beginning to help teachers to deal with the problems that they face. However, the way in which the structure of management in schools has changed is a major drawback, as it may prevent teachers from becoming more effective. At this time of the McCrone changes, the idea of subject departments in a secondary school is changing and the direct line to a principal teacher is becoming more attenuated. The structure of teaching in schools does not make it easier for teachers to be given more back-up in the classroom and to deal with the range of problems that have increased in recent years.</p><p>It is important that we take on board at ground level the experience of those who have been teachers. That will allow good initiatives to be taken in local areas and cascaded to the rest of the system. We do not always create a better system by reinventing the wheel in each school. I want the system to be able to prepare teachers much better for the circumstances that they will face.

We must explore why that is the case and ask what measures we need to take to create greater self-esteem. We must recognise that preventive public health measures take a long time to work and, therefore, that sustained investment will be required to bridge the gap between Scotland's life chances and the life expectancy figures of neighbouring nations.</p><p>The Highlands and Islands have a specific health profile, as the Scottish Executive has recognised. A four-year project was set up in 1999 to consider the remote and rural areas as an entity&#8212;the remote and rural areas resource initiative has begun to develop health care services and support for professional staff from Galloway to Shetland.</p><p>The demographic shift of young people out of the area and older and retired people into the area masks the stark health picture of the lowest income quartile of its residents. In the Highlands and Islands, the life expectancy of men is below the Scottish average, which in turn is a year and a half below that of Finland, three years below that of Norway and five years below that of Sweden. Mortality and distance are key factors in health provision, so RARARI's backing of, for example, the aortic aneurysm screening programme for men in the 65-to-74 age group is a key example of raising life expectancy by early intervention. Moreover, the mobile wheelchair repair service is a great boon for its 3,000 or so users in the Highlands and Islands. Members can imagine how difficult it is to service so many people in so many remote areas.</p><p>To make progress with those and other issues, RARARI must be transformed into a permanent <place-holder colnum=\"1905\"/> faculty of rural and remote medicine, perhaps co-hosted by the UHI Millennium Institute and the University of Aberdeen's Highlands and Islands health research institute, which is based in Inverness. The minister's response on that issue is crucial.</p><p>Cross-departmental issues have a big bearing on good health and I will mention two. The North West Cattle Producers Association aims to grow more native beef and to sell it to local markets before thinking about exports. However, unless the Scottish Executive's forward strategy for agriculture does everything that it can to encourage such schemes, more families will opt out of living in the area and fewer people will be able to afford the prime beef that is on offer, given the chronically low wages.</p><p>The well-being induced by playing music is an international phenomenon. The Gaelic-music f&#232;is movement regularly involves more than 4,000 young Scots every year in focused musical activity. The F&#232;is Rois outreach programme takes young traditional musicians into primary schools in social inclusion partnership areas. I would like members to hear the response of a teacher from East Ayrshire on the health implications of a recent visit by a group of musicians. The teacher said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The morning the team arrived had been particularly difficult due to external factors. The group lifted our spirits and helped focus our minds. Our children with special needs in particular dyslexia benefited considerably from the experience. Two days later a group of P3 children created their own dance and demonstrated it to us in the playground.\"</p><p>The teacher went on to comment that to develop the ideas would take a good deal more specialist training and funds.</p><p>We are developing well-being and public health interventions that stand comparison internationally, but we have much to learn from the Finns and Swedes. In the far north of Norway, there is an excellent programme to retain and recruit young doctors. Through group working, that programme achieves far greater levels of recruitment and retention than those in the north of Scotland, where the conditions are much easier. We should use such international comparisons to try to improve our game.</p><p>I will end by quoting one of the speakers at a major conference on international medicine, Dr Jane Farmer from Aberdeen, who said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The well-being of rural areas is an issue for all Scottish people and decisions about health service redesign must be taken within a holistic planning context\"&#8212;</p><p>which means not just by the NHS&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"and informed by evidence about impacts on wider rural community sustainability.\"<place-holder colnum=\"1906\"/></p><p>Our Parliament must not fail remote and rural areas, because a third of Scots live in them.

Scotland can only protest as a marketing organisation.</p><p>Brian Simpson was in charge of the Scottish Quality Beef and Lamb Association at the time when the BSE debate took place. Nothing in the quality arrangements related to the health of the animal. The quality was about marketing.

We must combine the sustainability questions that relate to the health of the animal and the value of the products concerned. The questions about sustainability in the debate must be much more carefully drawn.</p><p>The debate has considered most of those matters with regard to fin fish. It concerns me deeply that previous speakers have overlooked a whole area of sustainable activity&#8212;the shellfish industry. It gets the occasional mention, but the fact is that much of that industry does not require the kind of feed input that salmon farming does and that has led to the controversies about the implications of the salmon food that we use.</p><p>I would like to hear from the minister exactly what he will do to try to create the take-off point for the sort of community organisations about which he talks in the strategy and which could benefit from shellfish development. It is essential to know that such developments could happen on a small scale and in the hands of local communities and small firms in a way that salmon farming could not in global thinking.</p><p>The quality of such operations would rely on our having extremely clean water. They are therefore also reliant on our cleaning up the issues relating to the siting of fish farms. That has been a long and detailed debate, which has taken into account many different aspects of where fish farms are placed and the regulatory framework for that. When I notice that a body such as the Crown Estate lists the seven or nine steps that somebody must take before they can set up a salmon farm, I have to ask myself whether there should not be an easier way for the Government to prepare a one-stop-shop for opening new companies, whether in salmon or shellfish.</p><p>Having fought against the Crown Estate for longer than most members in the Parliament&#8212;indeed, Fergus Ewing's mother, I and others were out campaigning about the matter some 20 years ago&#8212;SNP members know that no progress has been made up to this point. In the four and a half years of the Scottish Executive's existence, there has been no progress in dealing with the question. We know that the Executive is talking about doing something in future. However, the money that the Crown Estate takes out is a drain, and the fact that local authorities should have been given the appropriate planning powers years ago is another complicating factor. The SNP would like some connection between the strategy and the stating of dates for when the transfer of those powers will take place.</p><p>On salmon and other fish as food, we must bolster public confidence in a fashion that says to people that they cannot always get the best-quality <place-holder colnum=\"1531\"/> food by paying the cheapest prices. I listened with interest to George Lyon's comments about the way in which the supermarkets play on both sides: they want the quality produce, but are prepared to take cheaper imports. We must do something that shows the Scottish population the value of being able to buy something that has a quality standard in terms of health, as well as of the branding that has been used before. That might mean that we require much clearer labelling and a good deal more regulation on what is allowed to be imported into this country.</p><p>It is interesting that people are concerned that the Norwegians are dumping salmon here, to use their words. Europe and the United States of America have been dumping food in the developing world for decades. One of the major debates taking place at the World Trade Organisation this week involves trying to stop that sort of approach. As far as I am concerned, we must be consistent.</p><p>We need European regulations that allow us to practise fair trade in shellfish and salmon, rather than free trade, or even the backstairs trade that has taken place with regard to Norwegian salmon.

That is why we in the SNP are so frustrated with new Labour and its Lib Dem partners for the six-year delay in setting up patient consultation and involvement in a workable framework. It has taken 50 years since the start of the NHS for us to get to this stage&#8212;thank goodness that we are beginning to address the issue now.</p><p>It is no accident that citizens advice bureaux had to evolve after world war two to give people help and advice about the services to which they have rights.

That is why more rights of involvement for patients are long overdue. People correctly welcomed the NHS as a milestone in state welfare services, but a better quality of service has been sought from early on in its existence. That is why the health council element has to be independent of the NHS system and why health councils must not be bean counters in the annual accountability review process of another NHS department.</p><p>The SNP's long-held policy is to democratise health boards by having a directly elected element, and we have identified that as a key aspect in our amendment. Health boards could include members from local authorities or directly elected members of the public and elections could follow the four-year council election cycle. There is also a need for community councillors to sit in on the management decisions of local health care co-operatives. That measure could go a long way towards opening up lines of communication with health professionals.</p><p>Statistics show that the decreasing satisfaction rates in recent times come at the same time as communication problems form the core of complaints between health service staff and patients.

It took seven or eight months for such a meeting to be called, which is a long time considering that people in Caithness are said to be pulling their own teeth or having to make a 100-mile round trip to get an emergency appointment.</p><p>The fact that a meeting had to be held with health care professionals and management shows that the matter is of major concern to people in Caithness. The volume of complaints eventually led to a helpline being installed, but it was deemed to be worse than useless, as the information was out of date, inadequate and inappropriate.</p><p>Further expressions of public outrage led to Thurso community council inviting the trust to an open meeting during the election campaign in April. No trust personnel were available to appear, but two political parties&#8212;not the Conservatives or the Labour party&#8212;answered the invitation to hear 100 people letting off steam.</p><p>By 2 June, the trust finally held a consultation meeting on the way ahead, which was attended by MSPs, councillors and local community representatives. However, the meeting was held in Inverness, which is 100 miles away from the problem.

Listen to the youngsters; listen to what they have to say about their school experiences and out-of-school time. Where is the evidence that the Executive really does listen? Does it hear the views of the large number who escape&#8212;who get out of their family surroundings and communities because they think that there is little future there? Look at the brain drain of our youngest and brightest. Look at the census data, which I spoke about in my first speech last week, and ask whether they do not show one of the root problems that requires creating a different future for Scotland, so that those young people will stay here.</p><p>What does the partnership agreement do to encourage a positive view of Scotland's future? Does the Executive instruct Careers Scotland to provide detailed information on exciting jobs in every part of Scotland, so that well-qualified people can return to those areas? Does Careers Scotland give enough detailed knowledge to young people before they leave to do such jobs, or do those exciting jobs not exist yet? How are <place-holder colnum=\"458\"/> young people valued when so much of the recent election propaganda was so negative? Refusing to seek more powers for our Parliament and rubbishing those who boost national self-confidence is the other side of the coin of failing to listen to young people&#8212;and older Scots for that matter.</p><p>I wonder if the Executive has listened to Carol Craig's trenchant analysis in \"The Scots' Crisis of Confidence\". That book underlines so much of what has not been heard about the real condition of so many young people in this country. I urge the Executive to start to analyse the experiences that so many of our young people have in Scotland today.</p><p>I quote Highland Youth Voice. That group, which is part of the Scottish Youth Parliament, was involved recently in an exercise in Drumnadrochit to bring communities together. It said, having been able for the first time to publish its own materials:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"These new materials are some of the first published by young people for young people. \"</p><p>The fact is that far too often we talk down to young people. As adults we say, \"This is what is good for you\", but we do not encourage enough young people to speak for themselves.</p><p>I notice that Peter Peacock's motion does not mention culture. That is not an oversight. It shows the level of priority that the Government gives to that aspect of our lives. Look at the low priority that the Executive gives to Gaelic and to Scots. Those languages were blocked in the last Parliament, and there is no urgency to address the fact that those are the underpinning means of expression of our young people and of many communities.</p><p>I turn specifically to examine one positive message that could be built upon. I wish to address the work of F&#232;is Rois, which is the Gaelic music youth learning group based in Dingwall, and is part of F&#232;isean nan G&#224;idheal. It proposed a couple of years ago&#8212;and the Executive eventually backed this&#8212;that F&#232;is Rois should set up a traditional music musicians-in-schools scheme, which would allow young people in primary schools in many parts of Scotland to hear traditional music, or any kind of live music, for the first time.</p><p>Imagine a situation where primary 6 and 7 children in social inclusion partnership areas&#8212;for example, in North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Dunbartonshire, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire, for a start&#8212;had not heard any live music. We have a rich musical culture, and we also have a rich modern musical culture, but many young people never get to experience it. The results from those experiments are amazing. The feedback from the youngsters is terrific. The school head teachers <place-holder colnum=\"459\"/> are saying, \"When can we have the young, talented musicians back to play our traditional music and songs, and to teach dance and song as a legacy to leave in the schools?\" At the moment, only 4,000 children in Scotland have experienced that excellent time.</p><p>I wonder what 10 years of such experience would do for people's self-confidence and for a generation growing up in which only a few have experienced such activity. Fiona Hyslop's amendment, which mentions the fact that additional support is needed for culture and sport for our young people, addresses a problem that the Executive is skating over.

We lose most of our youngest and brightest people, despite the huge sustainable resources that the area contains. The First Minister acknowledged last year that emigration is a blight. Just how much of a blight is revealed in the 2001 census: Caithness lost 4.5 per cent of its people in 10 years; Sutherland lost 0.5 per cent; Lochaber lost nearly 3 per cent; Orkney lost 2 per cent; Shetland lost 2.4 per cent; Argyll lost 3.3 per cent; and the Western Isles lost more than 7 per cent. The true extent is disguised by the arrival of well-off retirees, who are far less economically active.</p><p>The loss from my area of major employers&#8212;such as the Nigg oil rig fabricators and the tweed maker Hunters of Brora Ltd&#8212;has forced economically active people to leave. That situation has to be reversed. Beyond Inverness, the inner Moray firth and Skye, that is the prime challenge, because a growing population will grow our economy. During the election campaign, Jack McConnell promised to focus on our needs, and noted that there is a particular disengagement between the Highlands and Islands and the Scottish Parliament. I disagree with the First Minister: that disengagement is from the Executive, which refuses to see the need for more powers for the Parliament to build our future.</p><p>Immigration could help&#8212;asylum seekers with skills could fill many jobs, but success will be measured when the children of families who are <place-holder colnum=\"220\"/> raised in the Highlands and Islands can find work there. Not unreasonably, people want Government to offer equal opportunities for their children to have a choice to work where they were raised. Compare that picture with the lives of families in rural Norway or Finland, or in the west of Ireland, whose Governments put them at the heart of those small independent European nations. They are culturally confident, ecologically diverse and have buoyant economies and local democratic powers that are far better than we experience here.</p><p>Fundamental to rebuilding population is the availability of land for affordable housing. How often do youngsters seek in vain for a house site in the crofting communities or a building plot in some small town? Landlords, planning laws and water authorities are the major problems that they face. Is the only alternative for the enterprising to leave?</p><p>The partnership agreement claims that the national planning framework will \"support area regeneration\", and that enhanced powers of the Scottish land fund will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"assist the purchase of land for community activity.\"</p><p>It also states that rural and remote communities will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"have their distinct needs reflected across the range of government policy and initiatives.\"</p><p>I issue this challenge, and will follow it up in the next four years: the coalition should bite the bullet and free up land for affordable housing. Will the coalition beef up compulsory purchase powers for local authorities and communities to buy land at prices that local residents and housing associations can meet? In the past four years the Executive has, in case it upset a few landowners, failed to give that matter real priority.</p><p>What about the people? If the First Minister's programme is to mean anything, it must meet people's needs, but the partnership agreement skates over the urgent need to find housing land and to make it available. Does the coalition really care that the lifeblood that is our young and active citizens is draining from huge areas of Scotland? With boundless green energy potential and acres of underused land, the Government must support repopulation of the most endangered species in the north of Scotland, and let people build the modern homes that they need in order to kick-start the economy there once again.</p>", "hdate": "2003-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13296889", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The success of this Parliament will, in the minds of the voters who I was elected to represent, be measured by whether we reverse the depopulation that blights much of the Highlands and Islands today.
