Mr Fraser mentioned distinguished recipients of research funding, including Sir Alexander Fleming. The MRC supported him as it has, over the years, supported many others at some point during their careers. I am sure that we would all wish to join in not only celebrating the MRC&#8217;s centenary but recognising its continuing significant investment in Scotland.</p><p>In addition to the many remarkable examples of research that have been cited in the course of this evening, I would like to mention a few more that I feel merit recognition. In doing so, I recognise that Mr Campbell mentioned the Farr institute and highlighted that research transcends all boundaries, whether those boundaries are those of Scotland or the UK, as was noted by Bob Doris and others.</p><p>It is invidious to pick out only a few examples of successful research in Scotland, but the Scottish Government&#8217;s chief scientist office enjoys an enduring and productive partnership with the MRC. The two organisations have for many years co-funded two research units&#8212;one in the area of hearing and the other in social and public health sciences&#8212;and, in 2008, jointly established the Scottish collaboration for public health research and policy. Of course, the current MRC chief executive officer, Professor Sir John Savill, was also the Scottish Government&#8217;s health directorate&#8217;s chief scientist in recent years.</p><p>Beyond those close collaborations, we also recognise the success of the nine additional MRC-funded centres and institutes across Scotland, including the protein phosphorylation unit in Dundee, the centre for virus research in Glasgow and the centre for regenerative medicine in Edinburgh, mentioned already, which hosts an impressive seven MRC-funded centres.</p><p>The MRC also takes the lead on a number of funding initiatives involving many key partners in health research funding, covering areas such as prevention research, lifelong health and wellbeing, infection research and, more recently, health informatics.</p><p>Its ability to pull together funding organisations into effective partnerships is to be commended, and, of course, it is important to remember the contribution of the NHS and charitable funders.</p><p>My colleague the Minister for Public Health recently announced the successful applicants for partnership funding with Alzheimer&#8217;s Research UK and Prostate Cancer UK, and made a call for applications in collaboration with muscular dystrophy charities.</p><p>Leading on from the success of those, the chief scientist office is now working with a number of other funders, including the Stroke Association, to develop similar partnerships that allow Scottish researchers to access more significant funds than each funder alone would be able to provide.</p><p>The debate has reflected the broad consensus on much that is in the motion. That said, the felicitous timing of the debate has meant that, inevitably, we have occasionally strayed into more contentious waters. I hope that it is not too uncharitable of me to wonder whether that was at least partly in Mr Fraser&#8217;s mind from the outset of the debate, even if he did not know when he lodged his motion on what date the debate would take place. However, even when we come to discuss the broader issues of research funding in the context of something as contentious as independence, there is more common ground than some speakers cared to acknowledge.</p><p>It is worth stressing that the funding that the MRC has invested in Scotland historically and at present is a clear recognition of the quality of our research in the sector. The fact that Scotland secures more than her population-based share of funding is a source of pride because, as Mr Fraser said, that funding is awarded on the basis of the excellence of the institutions and individuals concerned, regardless of where they are located. The grants are not acts of charity; they are recognitions of excellence.</p><p>Mr Malik asked where the money will come from to fund research councils in the future, given that it currently comes via the UK Government. I can answer that directly only by saying that the moneys will come from the same place as they ultimately come from now, which is in good share from Scottish taxpayers. With Scotland&#8217;s whole budget&#8212;as opposed to the share that is currently devolved&#8212;in Scotland&#8217;s hands, there will be nothing to stop Scotland paying into shared research councils.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22763129", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Medical Research Funding"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Murdo Fraser on securing the debate, which has provided us with a timely opportunity to celebrate Scotland&#8217;s long-standing contribution to the world of medical research.

The debate is timely, giving us an opportunity to celebrate the work of the organisations that help the wider public to make sense of the science in their everyday lives and, therefore, contribute to the positioning of Scotland as a science nation.</p><p>What do we mean by a science nation? I think that we all want to see a Scotland that continues to embrace science; a Scotland that recognises and celebrates our rich tradition of science, discovery and innovation; a Scotland where our young people build on that legacy and see their future in science and engineering, in research and in turning that research into economic benefit; a Scotland where new scientific developments can be debated and discussed by the wider public without prejudice; and a Scotland where there are opportunities for people to explore science and find out something new, whatever their age or ability.</p><p>Admittedly, much of that will always rely on the strength of our education system and research base, as well as the economic development levers that nurture business, innovation and industry. However, there is a wider issue at the heart of the debate. How do we ignite that initial spark of interest in science? How do we encourage adults, who may have been let down by science at school, to re-engage with science issues that affect them, which can be as diverse as climate change, healthy eating and vaccinations? How can we encourage debate and discussion of new and often contentious science developments that will shape Scotland in the future, from stem cells to energy use?</p><p>That is where science engagement comes in. From science centres and science festivals to outreach tours taking Scottish research to schools and communities across the country, Scotland has an impressive network of organisations that take a more informal approach to science learning. By making science accessible to a wide public audience of all ages, the science engagement sector is making a valuable contribution to Scotland.</p><p>Let me explain in more detail what science engagement means, as it is separate from the formal education system. Science engagement involves scientists and science communicators meeting and interacting with the public in informal settings to explore and discuss science and its importance and relevance to everyday life. It can take place in cafes, pubs, theatres, cinemas and museums. It can include debates, hands-on activities and workshops, shows and films. Scotland&#8217;s four science centres and almost 20 science festivals provide a strong focus for making science, technology, engineering and maths&#8212;STEM&#8212;accessible to families, young people and adults.</p><p>It is, therefore, relevant to focus on the role of the science engagement sector in highlighting Scotland&#8217;s science strengths; in encouraging debate and discussion of topical or ethical science issues; in supporting science learning for all ages; and in promoting STEM careers. Of course, there will always be overlap with the formal education system. Indeed, many initiatives complement the curriculum and support science learning and teaching in schools. However, the focus of the debate should be the opportunities for people to engage more informally with STEM.</p><p>It should be said that, in that context, there has been a sea change over the past decade or so. There has been a move away from the &#8220;public understanding of science&#8221;, which implies that people just need to know a bit more about science, towards more active engagement and dialogue between the public and the scientist. That two-way encounter has the potential for reflective learning on both sides&#8212;by the science community as well as the public.</p><p>Why do we want the public to engage&#8212;to use that overused word&#8212;with science anyway? What benefits are there for society in a thriving science engagement sector? The benefits include encouraging science careers and science skills development, both of which are essential for our future economic growth. Members of all parties have raised that in the context of encouraging women into the world of science.</p><p>Another useful activity is the demystifying of science through researchers opening up their work.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691444", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Science Engagement Initiatives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Science, engineering and technology are shaping the world in ways that we would not have recognised just 10 or 15 years ago.

It is certainly fair to say that, across the science sector, there is a greater opportunity for women to engage in careers, but I accept that, particularly in physics and engineering, a great deal more work needs to be&#8212;and is being&#8212;done.</p><p>We also need to demystify science. That is particularly important given that much science research is publicly funded. People have a democratic right to know what they are paying for. Science engagement activities can also highlight Scottish science strengths. We should all feel proud of areas in which we lead the world&#8212;for example, through our contribution in surprising areas such as space science, as well as in plant and animal science.</p><p>All that work can encourage debate and discussion on current and ethical issues, such as energy use and climate change, or health-related issues. I hope that such debate can lead to positive behaviour change on travel choices, recycling and diet and exercise, as well as having a democratic function if public dialogue is linked to public policy development processes.</p><p>I also believe that it is good for scientists to be reminded that their work does not exist in a vacuum&#8212;although I suddenly realise that the work of some scientists probably does exist in a vacuum; I was speaking figuratively.

That is one of the reasons why we are continuing to support science festivals in towns, cities and islands across Scotland. From Orkney to Edinburgh and from the Western Isles to Fife, Caithness and Dumfries and Galloway, the events provide a more localised, grassroots focus to science engagement, attracting a combined audience of around 200,000 every year. Many festivals are organised by volunteers and charities and could not survive without input from local scientists.</p><p>I am delighted to confirm that in 2013-14 we will support 19 festivals with &#163;251,000 and that individual festivals will see no decrease in the funding offered for their events compared with that received in previous years. Indeed, the success of the Scottish science festivals and of our wider science base and science engagement sector was instrumental in the British Science Association choosing to hold its annual British science festival in Aberdeen last year, attracting 43,000 visitors.</p><p>We recognise that there are still significant parts of Scotland that are less well served by festivals and science centres. Audiences in rural areas can feel remote from the nearest hub for science engagement. Even in our cities and towns there are many people who would never consider visiting a science centre, a festival, a museum or other venue where science engagement activities take place.</p><p>With that in mind, in the past year we have pioneered a new approach to encourage science communicators to think more widely about their audiences. The new talking science grant scheme is an annual competition that challenges the sector to take science directly into communities in rural or deprived areas. In 2013-14, &#163;250,000 will support 14 new projects that are expected to reach 78,000 people, as well as 16 projects continuing from last year.</p><p>This year&#8217;s new projects include the Clipperton project&#8217;s floating lab, which is a converted boat that will tour Scotland&#8217;s canals this summer with activities that bring engineering and nature to life; and the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s hope beyond hype project that sees stem cell researchers working with patient groups and the wider public in rural areas, but especially young people, to explain the potential opportunities presented by that area of science.</p><p>I said earlier that the focus of the debate is not on science in schools. However, I want to spend a moment to acknowledge that in 2013-14 we will continue to support a number of initiatives that provide schools with a way to help bring science learning and teaching to life in the classroom. For example, Edinburgh International Science Festival&#8217;s generation science tour takes workshops and shows to more than 50,000 primary pupils every year; the Institute of Physics lab in a lorry takes physics activities to 10,000 secondary pupils every year; and there are STEM clubs in schools, through the Scottish Council for Development and Industry&#8217;s young engineers and science clubs, and STEMNET&#8217;s advice service, both of which help teachers set up and run a science club.</p><p>In addition, the big bang Scotland event that will be held in Glasgow next month will give young people a unique opportunity to explore STEM subjects in a fun and inspiring environment. It is coupled with the Scottish finals of a number of Scottish and UK STEM competitions. In 2013-14, we will provide more than &#163;200,000 to support those and similar initiatives.</p><p>Supporting the science engagement community is not just about funding. As well as our work with the organisations already mentioned, the Scottish Government works with a number of other science engagement providers by making connections and helping to drive partnerships and collaborations. That includes work with STEMNET&#8212;the UK-wide charity that promotes STEM in schools&#8212;and the Edinburgh Beltane at the University of Edinburgh, and regular liaison with our universities and research institutes to ensure that they are aligned with other initiatives. For example, partnerships in the science engagement community are embracing the 2013 year of natural Scotland, with a number of themed events and activities taking place across the country to highlight some science aspects of our natural landscapes and habitats.</p><p>There is a great deal to celebrate about our science engagement community, but there will always be challenges, particularly in funding and how to increase audiences. That is especially the case in relation to communities that are less able or willing to engage with science.</p><p>There is clearly a role for science communicators, industry and academia to play their part, and I know that there are many initiatives that involve collaborations between these three main areas. There is also a role for colleagues in the Scottish Parliament. We can help to raise awareness of the opportunities available, many of which are free of charge, for our local schools and communities to find out more about science.</p><p>Colleagues in Inverness, Glasgow and the Borders may be interested in attending science festivals in those areas over the coming few weeks, and I am sure that many members will want to encourage schools in their constituencies to attend the big bang Scotland event in Glasgow on 14 June, to compete for prizes or just have a great day out, immersed in science.</p><p>The science engagement sector in Scotland is clearly thriving and playing an important role in helping scientists and the public come together. By making science more accessible and exploring the opportunities and challenges posed by current research and new developments, we can help ensure that the wider public has the tools that they need to make informed decisions on issues that affect their everyday lives. That is an important aspect of building a science nation, and I look forward to continuing to support our diverse science engagement sector in achieving that.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament values Scotland&#8217;s science centres and science festivals; notes the efforts made by them and other organisations to make science accessible to a public audience of all ages, and welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s continuing support for a range of public science engagement initiatives through annual funding.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691444", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Science Engagement Initiatives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Okay.

Clare Adamson, Neil Bibby and Nanette Milne all highlighted the point that was made throughout the debate about the importance of women in science. It is worth adding that Angela Constance&#8217;s strategic group on women and work is looking at the skills gap in terms of gender and that the Royal Society of Edinburgh&#8217;s report &#8220;Tapping all our Talents&#8212;Women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics: a strategy for Scotland&#8221; has challenged all of us not only to ensure that female role models for science are developed but to take continual action to ensure that such role models are presented early in people&#8217;s education, particularly at school.</p><p>Mark Griffin and Neil Bibby made the important point that, if we are going to promote engagement with science, it must include the less-affluent areas of Scotland. A great deal of that has to do with school leadership, of which there are very good examples in many of our most deprived communities, as I have seen, and it has to do with having high ambition for everyone and their potential careers.</p><p>It should be said that the science centres are doing good work in promoting the work of the science community in some of our most deprived communities and making connections between the work of the scientist and some of the issues that affect all of Scotland, but particularly those communities. I have seen a great deal of work done in schools, for instance, through the science centres on smoking, diet and other social issues that affect all of Scotland, but particularly the most deprived areas.</p><p>Willie Coffey raised interesting questions about small and large companies investing in science and the role of science in the Government. Sandra White talked about some of the achievements of the Glasgow Science Centre and its work as an outreach facility for schools and communities in Glasgow. She also made good points about the highers and other qualifications that are required of people who go into primary teaching.</p><p>Possibly the best thing to say about the debate that erupted over whether a science higher or a language higher is the most important in that context is that perhaps it is most important to ensure that the people who go into teacher training or teacher education courses get the opportunity to study those subjects once they get in. The GTC and others are debating whether people who do not have certain qualifications should be turned away, but I think that there is unity on the need to provide opportunities for people to do new subjects in languages and science once they get on to teacher education courses.</p><p>The Government supports the sciencewise initiative, whose goals are to have evidence-based policies that are informed by research on attitudes and behaviours among stakeholders and the public; to increase awareness and understanding by policy makers of the value and role of public dialogue; and to embed public dialogue experience and expertise in public bodies with responsibility for policy that contains a major science and technology element. Through our involvement in the sciencewise steering group, we are exploring such projects with policy officials who work in areas as diverse as marine management and climate change behaviour.</p><p>Members raised other interesting issues. For example, Liam McArthur talked about ensuring not only that careers in science are open to women but that we retain women in science. He referred to the cultural change that is necessary to ensure that the public have a role in all that. Interestingly, he said that talking about Scotland&#8217;s contribution to science&#8212;in his case, it is specifically Orkney&#8217;s&#8212;can facilitate enthusiasm and learning about Scotland. Of course, it need not be learning about Scotland in the abstract, as some people seemed to fear, but learning about things in Scotland, one of which is science&#8212;the local connection can bring that alive. Jim Eadie talked about the achievements of the University of Edinburgh and other Scottish universities, not least in power and renewables.</p><p>I hope that science dialogue is a two-way process. Sometimes, the existing Government policy agenda drives the topic of debate, public engagement, dialogue and consultation about the scientific aspects of emerging issues, and that may lead us to focus some of our public science engagement funding on initiatives to support and inform that. Sometimes, it is the other way around. Public dialogue can drive the development of new or improved policies that are influenced or underpinned by science.</p><p>Since becoming science minister I have visited a number of our science festivals and centres and I have seen at first hand how they make science accessible, fun and exciting for all ages. Today&#8217;s debate has confirmed that many of us value the science engagement sector. As part of Scotland&#8217;s cultural mix, there is certainly a place for science-related events and activities alongside areas that we would perhaps more traditionally class as the arts. I think that we agree that science engagement is more than just nice to have; it has a real impact, particularly on our young people.</p><p>Among the myriad of influencers on learning, attainment and career choice, is there any evidence that science engagement makes a difference? I think that it does. It may be hard to measure the direct impact over the medium to long term&#8212;that fact is acknowledged by those who work in the sector and by the Wellcome Trust&#8217;s review of the UK&#8217;s informal science learning sector, which was published last year.

That is particularly important given that much science research is publicly funded. People have a democratic right to know what they are paying for.

Public reaction to and interaction with emerging scientific developments is part of the research process, and the science community must remember that, too.</p><p>What is the Scottish Government doing to support science engagement? First and foremost, we have a comprehensive package of annual funding, which we believe is unique in the United Kingdom. I am pleased to announce that, in 2013-14, we will continue to support the four science centres in Scotland with funding that is worth a total of &#163;2.53&#160;million.

That is one of the reasons why we are continuing to support science festivals in towns, cities and islands across Scotland. From Orkney to Edinburgh and from the Western Isles to Fife, Caithness and Dumfries and Galloway, the events provide a more localised, grass-roots focus to science engagement, attracting a combined audience of around 200,000 every year. Many festivals are organised by volunteers and charities and could not survive without input from local scientists.</p><p>I am delighted to confirm that in 2013-14 we will support 19 festivals with &#163;251,000 and that individual festivals will see no decrease in the funding offered for their events compared with that received in previous years. Indeed, the success of the Scottish science festivals and of our wider science base and science engagement sector was instrumental in the British Science Association choosing to hold its annual British science festival in Aberdeen last year, attracting 43,000 visitors.</p><p>We recognise that there are still significant parts of Scotland that are less well served by festivals and science centres. Audiences in rural areas can feel remote from the nearest hub for science engagement. Even in our cities and towns there are many people who would never consider visiting a science centre, a festival, a museum or other venue where science engagement activities take place.</p><p>With that in mind, in the past year we have pioneered a new approach to encourage science communicators to think more widely about their audiences. The new talking science grant scheme is an annual competition that challenges the sector to take science directly into communities in rural or deprived areas. In 2013-14, &#163;250,000 will support 14 new projects that are expected to reach 78,000 people, as well as 16 projects continuing from last year.</p><p>This year&#8217;s new projects include the Clipperton project&#8217;s floating lab, which is a converted boat that will tour Scotland&#8217;s canals this summer with activities that bring engineering and nature to life; and the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s hope beyond hype project that sees stem cell researchers working with patient groups and the wider public in rural areas, but especially young people, to explain the potential opportunities presented by that area of science.</p><p>I said earlier that the focus of the debate is not on science in schools. However, I want to spend a moment to acknowledge that in 2013-14 we will continue to support a number of initiatives that provide schools with a way to help bring science learning and teaching to life in the classroom. For example, Edinburgh International Science Festival&#8217;s generation science tour takes workshops and shows to more than 50,000 primary pupils every year; the Institute of Physics lab in a lorry takes physics activities to 10,000 secondary pupils every year; and there are STEM clubs in schools, through the Scottish Council for Development and Industry&#8217;s young engineers and science clubs, and STEMNET&#8217;s advice service, both of which help teachers set up and run a science club.</p><p>In addition, the big bang Scotland event that will be held in Glasgow next month will give young people a unique opportunity to explore STEM subjects in a fun and inspiring environment. It is coupled with the Scottish finals of a number of Scottish and UK STEM competitions. In 2013-14, we will provide more than &#163;200,000 to support those and similar initiatives.</p><p>Supporting the science engagement community is not just about funding. As well as our work with the organisations already mentioned, the Scottish Government works with a number of other science engagement providers by making connections and helping to drive partnerships and collaborations. That includes work with STEMNET&#8212;the UK-wide charity that promotes STEM in schools&#8212;and the Edinburgh Beltane at the University of Edinburgh, and regular liaison with our universities and research institutes to ensure that they are aligned with other initiatives. For example, partnerships in the science engagement community are embracing the 2013 year of natural Scotland, with a number of themed events and activities taking place across the country to highlight some science aspects of our natural landscapes and habitats.</p><p>There is a great deal to celebrate about our science engagement community, but there will always be challenges, particularly in funding and how to increase audiences. That is especially the case in relation to communities that are less able or willing to engage with science.</p><p>There is clearly a role for science communicators, industry and academia to play their part, and I know that there are many initiatives that involve collaborations between these three main areas. There is also a role for colleagues in the Scottish Parliament. We can help to raise awareness of the opportunities available, many of which are free of charge, for our local schools and communities to find out more about science.</p><p>Colleagues in Inverness, Glasgow and the Borders may be interested in attending science festivals in those areas over the coming few weeks, and I am sure that many members will want to encourage schools in their constituencies to attend the big bang Scotland event in Glasgow on 14 June, to compete for prizes or just have a great day out, immersed in science.</p><p>The science engagement sector in Scotland is clearly thriving and playing an important role in helping scientists and the public come together. By making science more accessible and exploring the opportunities and challenges posed by current research and new developments, we can help ensure that the wider public has the tools that they need to make informed decisions on issues that affect their everyday lives. That is an important aspect of building a science nation, and I look forward to continuing to support our diverse science engagement sector in achieving that.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament values Scotland&#8217;s science centres and science festivals; notes the efforts made by them and other organisations to make science accessible to a public audience of all ages, and welcomes the Scottish Government&#8217;s continuing support for a range of public science engagement initiatives through annual funding.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electrical Safety in the Private Rented Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Okay.

Clare Adamson, Neil Bibby and Nanette Milne all highlighted the point that was made throughout the debate about the importance of women in science. It is worth adding that Angela Constance&#8217;s strategic group on women and work is looking at the skills gap in terms of gender and that the Royal Society of Edinburgh&#8217;s report &#8220;Tapping all our Talents&#8212;Women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics: a strategy for Scotland&#8221; has challenged all of us not only to ensure that female role models for science are developed but to take continual action to ensure that such role models are presented early in people&#8217;s education, particularly at school.</p><p>Mark Griffin and Neil Bibby made the important point that, if we are going to promote engagement with science, it must include the less-affluent areas of Scotland. A great deal of that has to do with school leadership, of which there are very good examples in many of our most deprived communities, as I have seen, and it has to do with having high ambition for everyone and their potential careers.</p><p>It should be said that the science centres are doing good work in promoting the work of the science community in some of our most deprived communities and making connections between the work of the scientist and some of the issues that affect all of Scotland, but particularly those communities. I have seen a great deal of work done in schools, for instance, through the science centres on smoking, diet and other social issues that affect all of Scotland, but particularly the most deprived areas.</p><p>Willie Coffey raised interesting questions about small and large companies investing in science and the role of science in the Government. Sandra White talked about some of the achievements of the Glasgow Science Centre and its work as an outreach facility for schools and communities in Glasgow. She also made good points about the highers and other qualifications that are required of people who go into primary teaching.</p><p>Possibly the best thing to say about the debate that erupted over whether a science higher or a language higher is the most important in that context is that perhaps it is most important to ensure that the people who go into teacher training or teacher education courses get the opportunity to study those subjects once they get in. The GTC and others are debating whether people who do not have certain qualifications should be turned away, but I think that there is unity on the need to provide opportunities for people to do new subjects in languages and science once they get on to teacher education courses.</p><p>The Government supports the sciencewise initiative, whose goals are to have evidence-based policies that are informed by research on attitudes and behaviours among stakeholders and the public; to increase awareness and understanding by policy makers of the value and role of public dialogue; and to embed public dialogue experience and expertise in public bodies with responsibility for policy that contains a major science and technology element. Through our involvement in the sciencewise steering group, we are exploring such projects with policy officials who work in areas as diverse as marine management and climate change behaviour.</p><p>Members raised other interesting issues. For example, Liam McArthur talked about ensuring not only that careers in science are open to women but that we retain women in science. He referred to the cultural change that is necessary to ensure that the public have a role in all that. Interestingly, he said that talking about Scotland&#8217;s contribution to science&#8212;in his case, it is specifically Orkney&#8217;s&#8212;can facilitate enthusiasm and learning about Scotland. Of course, it need not be learning about Scotland in the abstract, as some people seemed to fear, but learning about things in Scotland, one of which is science&#8212;the local connection can bring that alive. Jim Eadie talked about the achievements of the University of Edinburgh and other Scottish universities, not least in power and renewables.</p><p>I hope that science dialogue is a two-way process. Sometimes, the existing Government policy agenda drives the topic of debate, public engagement, dialogue and consultation about the scientific aspects of emerging issues, and that may lead us to focus some of our public science engagement funding on initiatives to support and inform that. Sometimes, it is the other way around. Public dialogue can drive the development of new or improved policies that are influenced or underpinned by science.</p><p>Since becoming science minister I have visited a number of our science festivals and centres and I have seen at first hand how they make science accessible, fun and exciting for all ages. Today&#8217;s debate has confirmed that many of us value the science engagement sector. As part of Scotland&#8217;s cultural mix, there is certainly a place for science-related events and activities alongside areas that we would perhaps more traditionally class as the arts. I think that we agree that science engagement is more than just nice to have; it has a real impact, particularly on our young people.</p><p>Among the myriad of influencers on learning, attainment and career choice, is there any evidence that science engagement makes a difference? I think that it does. It may be hard to measure the direct impact over the medium to long term&#8212;that fact is acknowledged by those who work in the sector and by the Wellcome Trust&#8217;s review of the UK&#8217;s informal science learning sector, which was published last year. Although regular and sustained access to innovative and exciting activities may have an influence, the views of parents and peers are also likely to feature prominently, as is the experience of STEM subjects in the classroom.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22691559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Electrical Safety in the Private Rented Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is important for all politicians and Government officials to keep abreast of public opinion on a range of issues as the science develops.

That was brought home to me a year ago when I found my four-year-old niece advising me not only that I should get myself an iPad, but on which type I should get.</p><p>For many children, the internet is not simply a device, a form of technology or a tool; it is an integral part of their lives, seamless with the physical world that lies outside of chat rooms, social media and blogs. As Mr Johnstone quite rightly said, it is another place where children go and interact with one another and with other people.</p><p>The Scottish Government remains committed to ensuring that the safety and wellbeing of Scotland&#8217;s children and young people is a key priority wherever they go. While it is the prerogative of children and young people to explore and enjoy the online world, it is our responsibility to ensure that they do so safely.</p><p>We need to ensure that our children and young people are fully equipped with the knowledge and skills that they need to use the internet safely. To that end, I was encouraged recently to see a class of primary 5 pupils in Fife learning about such basic questions as whether they should allow photographs of themselves to go online and whether they should allow strangers to have their home address. As Mr McDonald pointed out, none of this need take away from the enormous benefits that the internet brings, not least in rural areas, as Ms Grant observed.</p><p>We also believe that parents should be supported and empowered to protect their children online, and the current options on parental controls are an essential part of this work. Mr Johnstone acknowledged the difficulty of trying to police the internet. It is not simply a matter of filters and hardware; rather, as he pointed out, understanding and awareness are needed among parents, children and young people about the risks of the internet. We are working with many stakeholders in Scotland to improve the level of understanding, particularly through schools.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale mentioned the important reality that in some cases whole websites are devoted quite openly and commercially to the persecution of individuals. She also mentioned correspondence, which she did indeed have with the Government and with me in seeking a meeting to raise awareness around the issue. It was felt at the time that respectme was already undertaking a campaign of awareness, but that does not take away from the importance of the matter that she raises. For that reason, I am happy to meet her.</p><p>The Scottish Government is already planning a number of steps to raise awareness. They include supporting the UK safer internet centre&#8217;s &#8220;connect with respect&#8221; theme for safer internet day 2013, in which respectme is also involved, and launching an internet safety awareness competition for all Scottish schools, which will coincide with safer internet day on 5 February. The Scottish Government-led stakeholder group on child internet safety will continue to monitor online safety in Scotland.</p><p>Under the curriculum for excellence, health and wellbeing is now a curriculum area in its own right. Learning in health and wellbeing ensures that children and young people develop the knowledge and understanding that they need for mental, emotional, social and physical wellbeing now and in the future. That learning will, I hope, promote confidence, independent thinking and positive attitudes and dispositions, and it will help to develop the ability to make ultimately positive choices. Building up children and young people&#8217;s own capacities, skills and resilience as opposed to trying to resolve their difficulties for them will engender a sense of self-respect that will, in turn, impact on their respect for others.</p><p>Those principles apply equally across settings, be it in the classroom, in the playground or in children&#8217;s online activities. We know that children and young people&#8217;s wellbeing can be severely impacted by bullying, and I take the issue very seriously. Mr Robertson spoke very powerfully indeed about the responsibility that social networking sites have to ensure that they do not publish not only material that is actively harmful but material that encourages others to promote harmful behaviour as well.</p><p>Mr Dey and others mentioned that children as well as adults are capable of cruelty. Bullying of any kind is totally unacceptable and must be dealt with quickly whenever and wherever it happens. The Government recognises that anti-bullying approaches are best developed locally in consultation with the community. That is reflected in &#8220;A National Approach to Anti-Bullying for Scotland&#8217;s Children and Young People&#8221;, which aims to strengthen local solutions by offering guiding principles and common visions and aims.</p><p>I echo the sentiments of the motion and those of a number of speakers in the debate, and I commend the national anti-bullying service respectme. It supports adults who work with children and young people, building capacity to prevent and tackle all types of bullying effectively through training, policy development and the provision of advice and information through its website.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Safer Social Networking for Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I listened with great interest to the debate, and I thank Alex Johnstone for bringing the issue to the Parliament&#8217;s attention.

It is vital that we attract young people into careers in science, engineering and technology. Apart from anything else, STEM degrees are good degrees to have, as the employment rate from them is 84 per cent. The curriculum for learning approach will help to ensure that pupils at all stages can explore the real-life relevance of science. I believe, for the reasons that I have already described, that the greater focus that he is looking for is already under way, and for that reason I can happily accept the amendment.</p><p>Many members&#8212;including Neil Findlay, Iain Gray and Neil Bibby, among others&#8212;rightly referred to the role of women in science.

The Royal Society of Edinburgh produced an informative report on that earlier this year and, since then, we have held Scotland&#8217;s first employment summit for women; launched the new &#163;250,000 careerwise Scotland initiative, which is aimed at encouraging more young women to consider careers in the field of science; and committed to funding the Scottish resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology.</p><p>The issues that were raised around constitutional change were interesting.

We have heard from members about the quality of the support that the Camphill movement provides for children, young people and adults of all ages with learning disabilities, mental health issues and other support needs.</p><p>Camphill communities in Scotland support more than 400 children, young people, adults and older people through a mixture of residential and day support. More than a third of those people are under 26. I welcome the contribution that third sector partners, including Camphill Scotland, make to delivering services for people with learning disabilities.</p><p>As we have heard, the entire Camphill movement takes its name from Camphill estate in the Milltimber area of Aberdeen, where the Camphill founders opened their first community for children with special needs in June 1940. As Lewis Macdonald said, the origins of the movement are all the more remarkable, considering that many of its founders were fleeing Nazi persecution at that time. The expansion of Camphill to become a worldwide movement with more than 100 communities in more than 20 countries, including 12 in Scotland, is a credit to the dedication of the staff, co-workers, volunteers and everyone else who has contributed to its success over the decades.</p><p>Alex Fergusson, Aileen McLeod and Mark McDonald pointed to the achievements of Camphill in the field of food, not least in cheese, and I felt that I could almost smell that achievement keenly, given that my last sustenance was a bacon roll at 8 am in Stornoway airport.</p><p>The debate has provided a valuable opportunity to mark the contribution and achievements of Camphill internationally. The Camphill school in Aberdeen has played a major role in the success of the movement. The school provides care, education and therapy services for children and young people aged 3 to 19 with additional support needs arising from autism and complex physical disabilities.</p><p>Through the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, the Parliament set a clear expectation that every child or young person in Scotland should have any additional support needs identified and met. In response to the point that Alison McInnes made about the relationship between local authorities and Camphill, it is certainly the case that organisations such as Camphill play a crucial role in augmenting local authority provision and supporting some of our most vulnerable young people. The 2004 act places duties on local authorities to meet children&#8217;s needs, and those apply just as much to placements in independent schools as they apply elsewhere. Following the completion of Peter Doran&#8217;s review of complex needs provision last month, we are now taking forward his recommendations in order to ensure that every pupil gets the right help at the right time and in the right place.</p><p>In the joint Education Scotland and care commission inspection report on Camphill School Aberdeen that was published in January 2012, all the quality indicators were ranked very good or excellent. Particular strengths of the school include: happy, relaxed children and young people who feel safe, valued and respected; the dedication and enthusiasm of staff; and the use of the natural environment to help to develop children and young people&#8217;s skills.</p><p>As noted in the motion and by several members, the Camphill school also achieved the eco-schools green flag status earlier this year. Along with the Royal Blind School, the Camphill school is the only independent all-through&#8212;that is, from three to 18&#8212;additional support needs school to hold green flag award status in Scotland. A further 14 all-through ASN local authority schools have also attained green flag award status.</p><p>Camphill Scotland also deserves credit for its role in promoting the development and wellbeing of Camphill communities, including encouraging communities to work together and helping them to learn from one another and collaborate for common benefit. That community and ecological aspect of the Camphill schools was highlighted by both Joan McAlpine and Maureen Watt. In addition, Camphill Scotland engages with national policy and legislative changes, including self-directed support, the &#8220;The same as you?&#8221; learning disability policy and the children and young people bill.</p><p>The Scottish Government is now working on a new strategy document for people with learning disabilities that maintains the principles and direction of travel that were established by &#8220;The same as you?&#8221; Progress needs to be maintained on reducing barriers and discrimination so that the aspirations of people with learning disabilities to live meaningful, fulfilled, independent, included and healthy lives can be met.</p><p>The national drive to move away from long-term residential care for people with learning disabilities towards support in the community has been incredibly successful, as the vast majority are now supported in their local communities, including in Camphill communities. Having choice and control is also critical to achieving independence for those with learning disabilities. The on-going work on the passage of the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Bill and the wider self-directed support strategy will have a clear part to play in all of that.</p><p>By way of conclusion, let me say that Camphill provides an outstanding education in its broadest and most inclusive sense.

I certainly welcome this opportunity to listen to the thoughts and views expressed by members.</p><p>Like all members here, I am passionate about children and young people experiencing all aspects of the broad general education that they are entitled to under curriculum for excellence and in my view that includes the opportunity to play a range of musical instruments.</p><p>One of the benefits of my job is that I get to visit schools and see at first hand what is being achieved in our classrooms every day. I never cease to be amazed by the innovative examples of teaching and learning that I witness. I concur with Mr Gray, Patricia Ferguson and other members about the liberating power that music has for many communities within Scotland and worldwide. That is why I absolutely agree that music&#8212;and learning to play a musical instrument&#8212;can play a key role in a child&#8217;s education, benefiting their academic and social development and, as Liz Smith mentioned, inspiring them in other areas of the curriculum, too.</p><p>It never pleases me more than when I attend&#8212;and occasionally sing at&#8212;national events such as the Mod, where I am able to listen to youngsters from around the country giving expert vocal and traditional instrumental performances. I saw that at first hand when I was compering the Barra local mod earlier this year.</p><p>This debate is ultimately about the value of instrumental music tuition and our shared belief that every child should have the opportunity to learn to play a musical instrument. That being agreed, it is necessary to clarify what Mr Gray requested in his motion:</p><p>&#8220;That ... Parliament ... notes that ... 24 of Scotland&#8217;s 32 local authorities are charging up to &#163;340 per year for instrumental music tuition&#8221;.</p><p>I stress that the charges are applied to instrumental music tuition provided via the authority&#8217;s instrumental tuition service; the charges are not applied to classroom music lessons as part of the child&#8217;s curriculum learning. I appreciate that there is an issue in some authorities about classroom teachers being able to provide tuition in only three or four instruments themselves, and a debate then emerging about what other musical instruments should be free. That is an important debate to have, not least because of Tavish Scott&#8217;s point about the importance of some instruments to local musical traditions.</p><p>I think that we all agree that local authorities are under a great deal of pressure to deliver the services that are required of them, and the issue of charging for instrumental music tuition is not straightforward. If Liz Smith or others have evidence of local authorities that are profiting from any charges applied for accessing such provision, I would be pleased to look at that. I do not have such evidence at present. Out of all the authorities that apply charges for their instrumental tuition service, it should be said, in the interests of fairness, that only one does not offer concessions. All other authorities offer a range of concessionary rates dependent upon local policy and family circumstances.</p><p>I agree with Mr Gray, Clare Adamson, Jenny Marra and many others that no child should be denied the chance to develop their musical talent. There is&#8212;and there should be&#8212;systems in place to ensure that no child is ever denied an opportunity because of their background.</p><p>This Government is committed to working with local authorities and COSLA to find a way forward on this matter. We need to establish greater clarity regarding the position around the country on charging for instrumental music tuition. Our first priority is to examine the position for pupils undertaking SQA national qualifications.</p><p>Scotland on Sunday&#8217;s let the children play campaign raises a number of issues, some of which have been echoed by members in the chamber tonight, and not least of which is the array of different charging practices throughout the country. I am committed to finding solutions to the issues raised by the campaign. We are working with our colleagues in local government to find a way forward, in tough financial times, so that we maximise access to music tuition.</p><p>Other members mentioned the youth music initiative. I have met my colleague the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs about the initiative&#8217;s contribution to the debate. The initiative has received wide recognition for providing high-quality music-making opportunities for all young people&#8212;not just schoolchildren&#8212;and particularly for those who may not otherwise have had opportunities to participate. That is an important factor, given the cost of individual instruments, to which Stuart McMillan and others referred. Without a doubt, part of the increasing pressure that we face for instrumental music tuition in schools comes from the continued success of the youth music initiative. I was pleased to hear that the Scottish Brass Band Association has attributed the dramatic increase in the number of brass bands in Scotland to youth music initiative funding.</p><p>Funding projects and creating opportunities for young people to get involved in all types of music are a continued commitment from this Government.</p><p>To conclude, and to respond briefly to issues raised by Alison Johnstone and others, the provision of instrumental music tuition in schools varies widely across Scotland and is a complicated matter.

Perhaps I can add to them&#8212;without intending to be in any way flippant&#8212;by saying that it was thanks to Neil Armstrong that I first learned as a child of the existence of the town of Langholm. It was only some 25 miles away from where I lived, but in the Scottish Borders&#8212;with all that that traditionally implies&#8212;that was indeed a giant leap.</p><p>I mention that because, as others have said, one of the many generous things about the late Neil Armstrong was his willingness to work to inspire a whole generation about science&#8212;something of which his famous 1972 trip to Scotland and his on-going connections with his ancestral town were but parts.</p><p>I am grateful to Willie Coffey for giving us the opportunity to reflect on Neil Armstrong&#8217;s achievements and to restate our commitment to encouraging Scots of all ages to take inspiration from him and to strive to achieve new things in their lives and for their communities. Unlike Mr Adam, I had not quite arrived in this world when the moon landing happened, but I share his recollection of the importance of the space race and the culture around it to a generation of children.</p><p>During our debate, we have remembered Neil Armstrong as the first person to step on to the surface of another world. It is difficult to overstate what a transformation that represented, not only in our understanding of space, but in our dramatic new understanding of the earth. Perhaps the most influential of all the photographs that were taken from the moon was that of the earth. It was the first time that humans had truly seen their planet in its entirety. That point was well made by Mr Gray.</p><p>Perhaps less well recognised&#8212;although it was alluded to today&#8212;is the fact that Armstrong and his crew were exposed to significant personal danger. As Willie Coffey mentioned, in the minute before the lunar module was due to land on the moon, Armstrong realised that its trajectory was such that it was heading for a rock. Not only did Armstrong safely take manual control, as we heard, but he skilfully balanced the need to use extra fuel to reach the ground against the need to conserve enough fuel in the tank to be able to take off again from the moon&#8217;s surface. Having discovered that the ascent engine&#8217;s ignition switch was broken, the astronauts improvised a fix using part of a ballpoint pen to activate the module&#8217;s launch sequence.</p><p>All that ingenuity enabled them to return home&#8212;something that was, as Stewart Stevenson mentioned, by no means regarded as a foregone conclusion. Indeed, such was the doubt about whether the astronauts would get off the moon that President Nixon had two different speeches prepared to read out to the nation.</p><p>As Ms McAlpine reminded us, today&#8217;s debate is an opportunity to celebrate Scotland&#8217;s international standing in space research and satellite systems development. We have a national space technology centre, and Scottish Enterprise is working to develop a space innovation partnership to further promote excellence here. Scotland of course has long had a pioneering scientific research base, too, which is well illustrated by the recent work and achievements of Professor Higgs of the University of Edinburgh, whom I am pleased Elaine Murray mentioned. Having had a flash of inspiration in 1964 while he was out walking in the Cairngorms, he went on to propose the existence of a particle that is now called the Higgs boson. This summer, the European Organization for Nuclear Research&#8212;CERN&#8212;announced the discovery of supportive experimental evidence for the existence of the Higgs boson&#8212;a particle that is often referred to as the most sought-after particle in modern physics.</p><p>Earlier this month, the First Minister opened the new Scottish dark sky observatory near Dalmellington, within Galloway dark sky park, which is supported by the Scottish Government. As the only gold standard dark sky park to have an observatory, it will provide a good focal point for people to capitalise on the excellent star-gazing opportunities there.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s links to space travel continue. Following in Neil Armstrong&#8217;s inspiring footsteps at NASA is space shuttle commander Bonnie Dunbar, whose grandparents were from Dundee and Banff. Dr Dunbar, I am pleased to say, took a saltire into space. She recently travelled back to Scotland by more conventional means to help to promote an event at Glenelg to celebrate the fact that there is, as Mr McGrigor mentioned, now a Glenelg on Mars.</p><p>Advances in science and technology will continue to help to underpin not only our economy but our culture. We must continue to nurture them, both by attracting leading researchers from around the world and by ensuring that our young people have educations that can lead to similar pioneering careers in science and engineering here in Scotland.</p><p>Today, however, the Scottish Parliament is honoured, along with countless organisations and bodies around the world, to recognise the sheer scale of Neil Armstrong&#8217;s &#8220;giant leap for mankind&#8221;. Landing on the moon was the act of a truly pioneering spirit and a triumph for all who are able to use discovery and ingenuity to find practical solutions to unexpected problems. Those same qualities help people and nations to prosper, which is why Neil Armstrong&#8217;s enduring contribution is his continuing ability to inspire young people to strive to be the very best that they can be.</p><p>13:15 Meeting&#160;suspended.</p><p>14:30&#160;On&#160;resuming&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674991", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Neil Armstrong"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Others have given very eloquent accounts of Neil Armstrong&#8217;s life and achievements.

As Nanette Milne rightly mentioned, Margaret Mitchell, as convener of the cross-party group on dyslexia, is a passionate advocate for raising public awareness and understanding about dyslexia and for ensuring that those affected receive the support that they need.</p><p>I share that passion. Every pupil in Scotland should experience the broad general education that they are entitled to under curriculum for excellence. However, without appropriate support, many of our children and young people face barriers to learning that could prevent them from realising their true potential.</p><p>As others have mentioned, unidentified, dyslexia can cause frustration among parents, teachers and, most important, pupils. I heard about that directly today from Ellie Gordon-Woolgar who, as others have mentioned, is a 12-year-old pupil at Edinburgh academy. She presented me with a blue dyslexia awareness ribbon that I intend to wear during dyslexia awareness week. For those who are looking for the ribbons, there are some at the door at the back of the gallery.</p><p>As Neil Bibby mentioned, dyslexia brings strengths to many people, such as creativity and abstract thinking, as ably demonstrated by Ellie and her campaign. However, dyslexia also brings real challenges. As members have recognised, the ability to read and to communicate ideas in writing is critical if everyone is to access the full range of available educational opportunities.</p><p>Without appropriate support, a pupil with dyslexia may fall behind their peers, lose confidence in their abilities, and potentially disengage from learning altogether. That individual tragedy can become a collective national loss. In response to Mark McDonald&#8217;s points, it is vital that we ensure that people with dyslexia who are moving on from school&#8212;to work or to further or higher education&#8212;receive the support that they need to avoid that loss of potential.</p><p>Scotland has real strength in the most vital factor for modern economies&#8212;the human capital that is afforded by our greatest asset, Scotland&#8217;s people. If we are to continue to grow and develop, we need to build on that strength and create a Scotland where everyone is given the opportunity to succeed. Therefore, it is our responsibility to ensure that we have an education system that lives up to those aspirations and unlocks the true potential of our pupils.</p><p>As a Parliament, through the additional support for learning legislation, we set a clear expectation that every child and young person in Scotland should have any additional support needs identified and met. Mark McDonald rightly mentioned that we have come a long way. Although we have certainly made substantial progress in provision for pupils with dyslexia, we should all acknowledge that more needs to be done.</p><p>Across Scotland, 1.8 per cent of pupils receive additional support as a result of having dyslexia, but organisations such as Dyslexia Scotland estimate that the true figure could be as high as 10 per cent. As Margaret Mitchell said, we see substantial variations among local authorities in recorded support rates. For example, while 2.8 per cent of primary pupils in Inverclyde receive support for dyslexia, the equivalent figure for North Lanarkshire is 0.2 per cent. In the secondary schools of Aberdeenshire the figure is 6.1 per cent, while only 0.6 per cent of secondary pupils in North Lanarkshire receive similar support. I do not mean to single out North Lanarkshire Council; I merely point out that the picture across the country is extremely varied.</p><p>Early identification of dyslexia needs to be a priority for all our schools. Those figures suggest that the needs of too many pupils in our classrooms are going unrecognised and unmet. Our statistics also indicate that pupils with dyslexia are not yet achieving parity with their peers in academic attainment or access to higher education. If we compare the outcomes last year for pupils with dyslexia with those for pupils with no additional support needs, we find that 25 per cent of those with dyslexia achieved at least five qualifications at standard grade credit level or equivalent, 13 per cent achieved at least three highers at grades A to C and 13 per cent went on to higher education, whereas the equivalent figures for those with no additional support needs were 59, 40 and 38 per cent.</p><p>Being diagnosed with dyslexia does not diminish a pupil&#8217;s potential, and I will not accept any limits being placed on people&#8217;s ambitions. The example of Jackie Stewart that was mentioned earlier is instructive in that regard. I have asked Education Scotland to investigate why those disparities exist and to identify and share the good practice that I know exists across Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674871", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dyslexia"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As others have done, I thank Margaret Mitchell for lodging the motion that we are debating.

Tha mi taingeil do Bh&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig airson an cuid &#249;ine, saothair agus l&#232;irsinn ann a bhith ag ullachadh a&#8217; phlana. Tha mi cuideachd gu h-&#224;raid taingeil do Art MacCarmaig, a bha roimhe na ch&#224;thraiche air a&#8217; bh&#242;rd, airson obair cho cruaidh air a&#8217; phlana seo.</p><p>D&#232; tha sinn ag iarraidh? Tha mise ag iarraidh d&#224; rud gu math s&#242;nraichte. Airson a&#8217; chiad rud, tha mi ag iarraidh gum bi an &#224;ireamh de dhaoine ann an Alba aig a bheil a&#8217; Gh&#224;idhlig ann an 2021 air ais aig an aon &#236;re &#8217;s a bha e ann an 2001. Bhiodh sin a&#8217; ciallachadh gun robh sinn air gr&#232;im fhaighinn air sti&#249;ir tancair-ola na G&#224;idhlig mu dheireadh thall. Airson an d&#224;rna rud, tha mi ag iarraidh gum bi daoine leis a&#8217; Gh&#224;idhlig de&#242;nach G&#224;idhlig a chleachdadh nas trice agus gum bi &#224;itichean agus suidheachaidhean ann far am bi e comasach G&#224;idhlig a chleachdadh.

Seo na tha againn leis a&#8217; phlana n&#224;iseanta.</p><p>Tha am b&#242;rd air grunn raointean-leasachaidh ainmeachadh agu seo iad: dachaigh agus tr&#224;th-bhliadhnaichean; foghlam ann an sgoiltean agus tidsearan; foghlam seach-sgoile; coimhearsnachdan; &#224;ite-obrach; ealain agus meadhanan; dualchas agus turasachd; agus corpas a&#8217; ch&#224;nain fh&#232;in. Fhad &#8217;s a tha sinn a&#8217; gluasad air adhart leis a&#8217; phlana, bheir e cothrom dhuinn ar dealas G&#224;idhlig bhon mhanifesto a chomharrachadh.</p><p>Ach tha am plana ag r&#224;dh rudeigin t&#242;rr nas bunaitiche na sin. Mar a bhios fios agaibh, bha rannsachadh air a dh&#232;anamh o chionn ghoirid mu choimhearsnachd Shiaboist ann an Le&#242;dhas. Chan eil adhbhar sam bith dhuinn creidsinn nach eil suidheachadh Siaboist diofraichte bho bhaile sam bith eile air a&#8217; Gh&#224;idhealtachd. Anns an fharsaingeachd, tha an rannsachadh ag innse gu bheil an t-&#224;m againn d&#249;sgadh. Mar eisimpleir, tha a&#8217; mh&#242;r chuid de choimhearsnachd Shiaboist taiceil don Gh&#224;idhlig&#8212;agus tha sin math&#8212;ach fhuair an rannsachadh a-mach gun robh cuid a dhaoine den bheachd nach robh feum ann an cuid G&#224;idhlig a chleachdadh airson a bhith taiceil dhan Gh&#224;idhlig. Tha deagh eisimpleir an seo dha na coimhearsnachdan eile far a bheil G&#224;idhlig l&#224;idir&#8212;cleachd i no caill i. Na bithibh a&#8217; f&#232;itheamh timcheall airson cuideigin eile G&#224;idhlig a sh&#224;bhladh.</p><p>Agus don Riaghaltas agus buidheanan G&#224;idhlig, tha seo a&#8217; d&#232;anamh soilleir cho deatamach &#8217;s tha e gu bheil smachd aig coimhearsnachdan fh&#232;in mar a bu ch&#242;ir c&#224;nain a leasachadh. Air s&#224;illibh seo, bha mi cho toilichte a bhith an s&#224;s ann am plana G&#224;idhlig Shiaboist. Is e seo a&#8217; chiad plana den t-se&#242;rsa, agus tha mi air leth toilichte gun tug coimhearsnachd ceum cho s&#242;nraichte mar seo.</p><p>Feumar a-nis d&#232;anamh cinnteach gu bheil coimhearsnachdan eile mothachail air a&#8217; ph&#224;irt chudromach a tha aca a thaobh d&#232;anamh cinnteach gum bi a&#8217; Gh&#224;idhlig seasmhach agus gu bheil na goireasan aca seo a dh&#232;anamh.</p><p>Following is the simultaneous interpretation:</p><p>Although I am extremely proud to open the debate on the &#8220;National Gaelic Language Plan 2012-17&#8221;, I recognise from the outset that plans alone will not revitalise the language. A couple of weeks ago, I heard someone say on Radio nan G&#224;idheal&#8212;somewhat bitterly&#8212;that he hoped that there would be plenty of space in the new museum in Lewis for every old Gaelic plan that has been produced. In a polite way, perhaps that was a warning to me.</p><p>Although no single plan will ever be enough, a plan is still useful and important. For that reason, I am extremely pleased to be opening the debate on the national plan, which has been produced in line with the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005. I would like to thank B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig for the benefit of its time, energy and insight in preparing it. In particular, I would like to pass on my thanks to Arthur Cormack, the former chair of the board, for his work in the plan&#8217;s preparation.</p><p>What do we want? As many members know, I would like two things in particular. First, I would like the number of people who have Gaelic in Scotland in 2021 to be back at the 2001 level. Secondly, I would like to see people with Gaelic being prepared and willing to use the language more often, and for there to be opportunities and places for them to do so. The only way to achieve any of that is to have an unapologetic strategy for growth. The national plan is such a strategy.</p><p>The board has listed a number of development areas, which are grouped under the headings: &#8220;Home &amp; Early Years&#8221;; &#8220;Education: Schools &amp; Teachers&#8221;; &#8220;Education: Post-school Education&#8221;; &#8220;Communities&#8221;; &#8220;Workplace&#8221;; &#8220;Arts &amp; Media&#8221;; &#8220;Heritage &amp; Tourism&#8221;; and &#8220;Corpus&#8221; development. As we make progress with the plan, it will enable us to demonstrate commitment to our Gaelic manifesto commitments. In addition, the priorities in the plan will contribute to other manifesto commitments in areas such as language learning, Scottish studies, early years education and literacy.</p><p>The plan also says something more fundamental. As many members are aware, there was a recent study into Gaelic in the community of Shawbost in Lewis. I have no reason to believe that the picture in Shawbost is much different from that in other areas of the traditional G&#224;idhealtachd. Bluntly, the survey is a wake-up call. The community was broadly highly in favour of Gaelic, but a proportion of the Gaelic speakers who were surveyed believed that it was possible to be strongly in favour of Gaelic while seeing no need to speak Gaelic very much. That is a good example to communities where Gaelic is strong: use it or lose it, and do not wait for others to save the language.</p><p>For the Government and Gaelic bodies, the study highlights the importance of giving communities control over how the language should be developed. That is why I was pleased to be involved in the launch of Shawbost&#8217;s Gaelic language plan. It is the first plan of its type to be published and I am very pleased to see the community take such a positive step.</p><p>We must ensure that other communities see their important role in the survival of the language.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673806", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;National Gaelic Language Plan 2012-17&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Oifigear Riaghlaidh, ged a tha mi moiteil deasbad air plana n\u00e0iseanta na G\u00e0idhlig \u00f9r fhosgladh an-diugh, tha mi ag aideachadh bhon a&#8217; chiad dol a-mach nach bi planaichean a-mh\u00e0in gu le\u00f2r airson na G\u00e0idhlig ath-nuadhachadh.

Tha sinn a-nis ag obair air sti&#249;ireadh &#249;r airson foghlam tro mheadhan na G&#224;idhlig agus tha mi an d&#242;chas gum bi seo deiseil san fhoghar 2013.</p><p>Tha G&#224;idhlig ri faicinn &#8217;s ga cluinntinn anns gach ce&#224;rnaidh de dh&#8217;Alba. Tha an obair shoirbheachail MG ALBA agus BBC ALBA air a bhith uabhasach cudromach a dh&#8217;ionnsaigh seo. Mar as &#224;bhaist, tha Sabhal M&#242;r Ostaig agus F&#232;isean nan G&#224;idheal agus am m&#242;d ag obair air iomairtean &#249;r a bhios a&#8217; neartachadh a&#8217; ch&#224;nan. Am bliadhna, bha fi&#249; &#8217;s Disney a&#8217; cur ri luach agus inbhe na G&#224;idhlig leis an fiolm &#249;r &#8220;Brave&#8221;.</p><p>Ach, leis a seo, tha mi mothachail gu bheil d&#249;bhlain sh&#242;nraichte air thoiseach oirnn. Tha oifigear-trusaidh luchd-teagaisg G&#224;idhlig a-nis ag obair aig a&#8217; bh&#242;rd, agus mar sin tha barrachd tidsearan &#249;r againn am bliadhna na bha againn riamh ron seo. Le iarrtas foghlam G&#224;idhlig a&#8217; sior-fh&#224;s, tha feum ann airson tuilleadh tidsearan a tharraing agus a chumail ann am foghlam G&#224;idhlig cho m&#242;r &#8217;s a bha e riamh. Tha sinn mothachail air na trioblaidean an l&#249;ib seo a dh&#232;anamh agus is ann air s&#224;illibh seo a tha am b&#242;rd air buidheann-obrach a st&#232;idheachadh airson coimhead air a&#8217; ch&#249;spair seo. Dh&#224;-riribh, tha l&#224;n fhios agam gu bheil duilgheadasan ann le cuid de dh&#8217;&#249;ghdarrasan ionadail a tha a&#8217; cleachdadh nan tidsearan a tha aca airson G&#224;idhlig a-mh&#224;in airson teagasg sa Bheurla, agus feumar seo a cheartachadh sa bhad.</p><p>Ged a tha e sgoinneil gu bheil sgoiltean G&#224;idhlig st&#232;idhichte ann an Glaschu, D&#249;n &#200;ideann, Inbhir Nis, Port R&#236;gh agus an Gearasdan, tha sinn ag aideachadh gum feum adhartas tachairt ann an &#224;rd-sgoiltean cuideachd. Tha sinn mothachail gu bheil &#224;itichean timcheall na d&#249;thcha le deagh &#249;idh agus iarrtas sgoiltean G&#224;idhlig a bhrosnachadh, ann an &#210;ban, Obar Dheathain, Peairt, Condobhrait agus eile. Tha e deatamach nach e p&#224;rantan a-mh&#224;in a bhios a&#8217; toirt seo air adhart agus gum bi sinn a&#8217; soilleireachadh do dh&#8217;&#249;ghdarrasan ionadail na buannachdan an l&#249;ib a&#8217; ch&#224;nain.</p><p>Cuideachd, ann am m&#242;ran sgoiltean beaga air feadh na Gh&#224;idhealtachd agus anns na h-eileanan, tha aonadan G&#224;idhlig a&#8217; f&#224;s. Ma tha a&#8217; chuid as motha de ph&#224;rantan ga iarraidh, is e an ath cheum sgoil Gh&#224;idhlig a st&#232;idheachadh dhaibh. Tha mise deiseil agus de&#242;nach airson c&#242;mhradh leis na comhairlean agus coimhearsnachdan sin, agus tha mi an d&#242;chas gum bi rudeigin a&#8217; tachairt leis a seo air feadh na d&#249;thcha.</p><p>Th&#224;inig am P&#224;rtaidh N&#224;iseanta don Riaghaltas le dealas iarrtas airson foghlam meadhan na G&#224;idhlig a chur dhan lagh. Ged a tha sinn fhathast aig &#236;re gu math tr&#224;th leis a seo, tha mi an d&#242;chas gun teid seo tron Ph&#224;rlamaid ann an 2014.</p><p>Gu dearbh, chan eil e uile mu dheidhinn sgoiltean idir. Feumar d&#232;anamh cinnteach gum bi G&#224;idhlig air a bruidhinn agus a cleachdadh gu cunbhallach gach latha anns an latha an-diugh. Tha mi den bheachd gu bheil planaichean G&#224;idhlig air leth cudromach ma tha sinn a&#8217; dol a l&#236;bhrigeadh seo. Bu mhath leum taing a thoirt seachd do gach buidheann poblach a tha air plana G&#224;idhlig ullachadh.</p><p>Is d&#242;cha gu bheil seo cunnartach do mhinistear a r&#224;dh, ach tha mi a&#8217; toirt cuireadh an-diugh do choimhearsnachdan G&#224;idhlig a bhith radaigeach anns na rudan a tha iad ag iarraidh agus ag r&#224;dh. Tha mise l&#224;n d&#242;chais airson na G&#224;idhlig, ach cho fad &#8217;s a tha mi ag obair air planaichean tha mi a&#8217; tuigsinn nach eil planaichean ag obair no a&#8217; soirbheachadh fa-leth no nan aonar. Tha p&#236;os b&#224;rdachd le Maoileas Caimpbeul a&#8217; tighinn a steach orm. Tha e ag innse sgeul mu oilthigh nam boiteagan far an robh an roinn Ceilteis aca a&#8217; deasbad n&#224;dur de ghn&#236;omhairean mi-riaghaltaich fad an latha. Mar a thuirt am bard &#8220;th&#224;inig l&#242;n dubh an seo&#8221;.</p><p>Oifigear Riaghlaidh, tha mi a&#8217; tighinn do cho-dh&#249;nadh. Tha plana l&#224;idir agus freagarrach againn, ach chan eil an obair againn airson na G&#224;idhlig seachad an-diugh&#8212;chan eil ann ach toiseach t&#242;iseachaidh. Tha mi a&#8217; cur mo thaic ris a&#8217; ghluasad seo.</p><p>Following is the simultaneous interpretation:</p><p>I recognise that an event took place yesterday to remember Rob Donn. I am very supportive of every effort that is taking place in Scotland. In my own area of the country, there was an event in remembrance of the MacMhuirich bards and there is a lesson for us there. I am happy to be involved in such projects.</p><p>We must ensure that we are in clear support of the language and, since we came to government in 2007, we have proved that we are. We stopped the cuts to indigenous language budgets and showed that languages can improve the economy through such things as broadcasting and tourism.</p><p>Through the Gaelic schools capital fund we have been able to support the development of new schools and units while helping with improvements at other schools. We are working on the development of new guidance for Gaelic-medium education, which I hope will be available in the autumn of 2013.</p><p>We now have better support for Gaelic learning at all ages. Gaelic is more visible in Scotland through MG Alba and BBC Alba. Sabhal M&#242;r Ostaig and F&#232;isean nan Gaidheal continue to go from strength to strength with new initiatives. The Mod now has a very impressive number of young people attending and participating. Even Disney has added to the status and prestige of Gaelic with the inclusion of the language in their new animated production &#8220;Brave&#8221;.</p><p>With those successes come particular challenges. We have a designated Gaelic teacher recruitment officer at the board, and that has helped us realise the highest number of Gaelic teachers qualifying in a single year. However, we clearly require more teachers to meet growing parental demand. We are aware of the difficulties in recruiting and retaining individuals in Gaelic-medium education, which is why the board has established a short-term working group to look into those challenges. I am aware that in some local authorities Gaelic probationers who have been allocated specifically to deliver Gaelic-medium education are being used in the English stream. That needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p><p>It is very good to have Gaelic schools in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverness, Portree and Fort William, but we also need to ensure that progression is available to secondary school pupils. We know that other communities, such as Oban, Aberdeen, Perth, Condorrat and many others, have shown great interest in encouraging the development of Gaelic schools. It is essential that that should not just be parent led and that we take steps to encourage local authorities to see the benefits of the language and to provide those learning opportunities.</p><p>There are many examples of small schools throughout the Highlands and Islands with growing Gaelic units. If it is the wish of the majority of parents, the next step is to establish a Gaelic school for them. I am ready and willing to discuss that with councils and those communities. I hope that something will happen with regard to that throughout the land.</p><p>The SNP came to power with a commitment to look at legislation to deliver a parental right to Gaelic-medium education. We are at the early stages of the process but I hope that we will see a bill taken through Parliament in 2014.</p><p>Of course, it is not all about schools. We need to ensure the vitality and acceptability of the language in everyday life. The Gaelic language plans deliver in that regard and must be supported. I commend the public bodies that have produced plans. Gaelic language plans should be embraced, not feared. They need to be seen not as a burden or something that attracts additional cost but as a better use of resource.</p><p>The aim is clear: to reverse the fortunes of Gaelic in Scotland. That is not something that the Scottish Government or B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig can achieve by itself.</p><p>I am full of hope for the future of Gaelic but I fully understand that plans alone will not be enough to make the difference. A piece of poetry from Maoileas Campbell springs to mind. He tells a story of a university in which worms in the Celtic department debated the nature of irregular verbs all day. As the bard said:</p><p>&#8220;a black bird came here&#8221;.</p><p>We have a strong and appropriate plan, but the work for Gaelic is not done. This is merely a start. I commend the motion to the Parliament.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the principal and urgent need of Gaelic in Scotland is to see an increase in the number of people learning, speaking and using the Gaelic language; notes that the development areas and strategic priorities contained in the National Gaelic Language Plan have been identified and selected by B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig for the purpose of securing this aim, and further agrees that this plan should, therefore, be regarded as a strategy for growth that will encourage the Gaelic communities of Scotland to promote the language and speak it in more settings.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673806", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;National Gaelic Language Plan 2012-17&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tha mi a&#8217; tuigsinn gun robh rudeigin a&#8217; tachairt d\u00ecreach an-d\u00e8 airson a bhith ga chuimhneachadh, agus tha mi gu math taiceil dhan a h-uile oidhirp a tha ann ann an Alba air fad sin a dh\u00e8anamh.

Seo puing mhath mu dheidhinn cho cudromach &#8217;s a tha a&#8217; Gh&#224;idhlig.</p><p>Following is the simultaneous interpretation:</p><p>Thank you Presiding Officer&#8212;I do not know what the Gaelic is for &#8220;filibuster&#8221;, but I will do my best.</p><p>This summer, I was on the plane between Stornoway and Glasgow on a lovely evening. The plane was flying over the west coast of Scotland&#8212;all the coast could be seen&#8212;and it occurred to me that it was only 100 years since the majority of people in the areas that the plane was flying over could speak Gaelic, including the Western Isles, Skye, Mull, Islay, Coll, Tiree and Ross-shire, and that it extended to the majority of people in mainland areas, including Lochaber, Inverness, Sutherland, and Braemar, down into Argyll and Kintyre and near Dunoon. Even in Glasgow there were thousands of Gaels from the Outer Hebrides, and some from Donegal, too.</p><p>So what happened? As we heard today, it is easy to see that every part of the state was obviously against Gaelic&#8212;especially the schools, where it was made clear to the children that speaking Gaelic never put food on the table. The people of Scotland and Scottish politicians do not think that nowadays, as is clear from what members have said today.</p><p>However, the debate tells us at the same time that not everything is okay or as it should be with Gaelic, and that there is a lot yet to be done. People require confidence to use the language and we require teachers to keep up with the demand among parents for Gaelic-medium education. Many points were made on those subjects; for example, Annabel Goldie made useful points about broadcasting, history and teachers. I attended a course, which is on-going, for teachers who are working on their Gaelic skills. The Government is looking at the colleges and is establishing new courses for students who wish to teach in Gaelic.</p><p>Hugh Henry made useful points about education in Gaelic and the link between Gaelic and the economy. Dave Thompson spoke about Scotland as being a tri-lingual country and about how Gaelic helps people in their old age. There is a chance that other people will look at what happens to see whether Gaelic is of any use for the mind in old age.</p><p>Neil Bibby said that he is looking forward to the Royal National Mod in Paisley. I am looking forward to that, too, because our choir will be singing there. He referred to important points about the need for information and how the Government will put the plan together. The plan will appear, but I think that everyone will agree that there is a need for milestones on the road between where we are now and 2021; we have huge ambition on increasing the number of Gaelic speakers by then.</p><p>John Finnie made a point about how Gaelic is strong in his family&#8217;s younger generation and Lewis Macdonald talked about his family, too. His is a very educated family; indeed, the translation of Robert Burn&#8217;s poetry came from his family. He also made inventive points about Gaelic in relation to operating the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services and how important Gaelic is to CalMac.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673806", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;National Gaelic Language Plan 2012-17&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tapadh leibh, Oifigear Riaghlaidh.

That excellence is in abundance at the postgraduate end of the scale. It has been a policy of the Scottish Government to support as many people as we can in that regard. Education plays a huge part in underpinning Scotland&#8217;s international competitiveness, particularly when we can prioritise postgraduate study around some of the key subjects that drive our economy and social improvements, such as life sciences, engineering and teaching.</p><p>Without minimising the financial pressure that clearly exists for many students, it is true to say that Scotland is the only Administration in these islands to provide support across a comprehensive list of postgraduate disciplines, including law, which is the subject that we are debating today.</p><p>This year, the postgraduate students allowances scheme will support around 5,000 students studying more than 450 postgraduate subjects at 18 institutions. However, that was not always the case. Support for law and other subjects has evolved over a number of years and prior to the changes that we introduced two years ago, after consultation with representatives of the universities and the Law Society, the system supported only about 1,800 postgraduate students in Scotland with living and fee costs. To broaden that out&#8212;I remind members that the total number of students in higher education in Scotland is nearly 300,000&#8212;the Government removed the living costs element and used the money to support more students with their fees. That raised the number that we could help to around 2,700.</p><p>Support was still provided on a discretionary basis, however, and this year we developed the arrangements such that Scotland-domiciled and European Union students who follow a designated course of study in 2012-13 can apply for a non-means-tested loan of up to &#163;3,400, which can be put towards the cost of their tuition fees. We estimate that, with the improved arrangements, the number of students who benefit from our postgraduate support arrangements will increase to around 5,000. Approximately 700 of those students will be law students.</p><p>There is a need for the legal profession to give more thought to how it supports people who want to enter the profession, as Liam McArthur and other members said.</p><p>The Government is not promoting bigger numbers at the expense of wider access, as is suggested in the motion. Widening access is a priority for the Government. We committed in our manifesto to introducing statutory agreements that would force the pace of change, and that commitment will be taken forward in the post-16 bill that we plan to introduce later in this parliamentary session. In relation to widening access, significant resources are required, so we must prioritise. Our priority is to get as many students as possible through a first degree at undergraduate level.

To claim that the Government is directly responsible for decisions that colleges make about their own staff is slightly disingenuous.</p><p>As I am sure every member knows, we have embarked on the most ambitious reform programme of colleges since 1992. In recent months, we have heard much criticism of the funding settlement for colleges. Unfortunately, we have heard rather less about the additional &#163;40 million that has since been identified for investment in the college sector for 2012-13. I do not in any way seek to minimise the challenges that face all our colleges, but I believe that that is a remarkable achievement, given that we are in midst of the worst economic crisis that most of us can remember.</p><p>I am pleased that Patricia Ferguson has identified in her motion that the purpose of a college is to equip young people with the skills necessary to drive forward Scotland&#8217;s economy. It must surely stand to reason, therefore, that college provision should be closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. The Government&#8217;s position is clear: we have asked colleges to refocus their provision on courses that increase employability by delivering the skills that are most highly prized by employers. That will, of course, mean that colleges will sometimes have to look critically at courses that perhaps do meet a specific economic need. That a strategic decision that goes right to the heart of tackling the scourge of youth unemployment.</p><p>A number of members highlighted the role of colleges in addressing our economic needs and the needs of the young unemployed in particular. Annabel Goldie made that point, even if she somewhat undermined it by calling for an end to free education and claiming that college student support had been reduced to &#163;84 million when it has been maintained at &#163;95 million.</p><p>We are already reaping the benefits of some of the measures that have been taken. The latest figures show a 9 per cent increase in the number of full-time students studying advanced-level courses and a 1 per cent increase in the number of full-time non-advanced courses. Those are the true indicators of what we are achieving in the college sector: better courses and better attainment for better life chances.</p><p>The success of the college sector should rightly be measured by the quality and economic relevance of provision, not wholly by simplistically counting courses.</p><p>The debate has been useful. It has not been entirely straightforward at times, but we have heard informed contributions from Sandra White, Joan McAlpine and Paul Martin&#8212;he was making an informed contribution until he resorted to the straightforward untruth that the cabinet secretary had told young people in Scotland that they should not go to college. He should reconsider that outlandish claim.</p><p>In conclusion, our vision is for a college sector in which learners who complete a course can be confident they have achieved a prestigious qualification that is highly prized by successful employers in Glasgow and beyond.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22670516", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: North Glasgow College (Funding Cuts)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the member knows, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council makes decisions about the funding of individual institutions.

Guten Tag. I am delighted to open the debate on why languages matter&#8212;improving young people&#8217;s opportunities. This is a welcome opportunity to discuss where Scotland stands in terms of language learning and what aspirations we should have for our young people and society in engaging with an increasingly globalised world. The debate follows on from the publication last week of the languages working group report, which meets our commitment in the curriculum for excellence action plan that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning announced on 21 September last year.</p><p>As someone with a passion for languages, I believe that the case for languages is pretty self-evident. It strikes me as intrinsically interesting that Norwegian puts the definite article on the end of a noun or that Gaelic has no words for yes and no. However, as last year&#8217;s modern languages excellence group report set out, in Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, we are often confronted with negative or lukewarm attitudes towards learning other languages. Perhaps the most disappointing of all such attitudes was one that I heard in the media this week, when someone suggested that teaching languages might somehow be &#8220;wasted&#8221; on children from working-class backgrounds. I am happy to say that that was not the dominant reaction.</p><p>The excellence group report stated the positive case for language learning, framing it within the benefits that language learning offers the individual learner as well as the economy and society. The report also sought to debunk common myths about languages, such as the idea that everyone in the world speaks English and that therefore learning other languages is unnecessary. In fact, 75 per cent of people in the world do not speak English and, of those who do, most do so as a second language. In any case, that view ignores research that points to the competitive advantage that multilingual youngsters from other countries bring to the competition for jobs with their UK counterparts in global companies and organisations.</p><p>The Government is determined to be ambitious for the people of Scotland. In last year&#8217;s election, our manifesto included a commitment to introduce, over the course of two sessions of Parliament, a norm for language learning in schools that is based on the European 1+2 model, to create the conditions in which every child will learn two languages in addition to their mother tongue.</p><p>We therefore set up the languages working group to consider how a 1+2 model might be delivered, taking account of Scotland&#8217;s circumstances. In particular, the group was asked to consider how such a model could be delivered within the framework of curriculum for excellence. The working group report, which was published last week, and the accompanying report on the link between languages and employability further emphasise the economic benefits of improving the language learning experience of Scotland&#8217;s young people. The reports also present a strong argument for giving our children and young people the opportunity to learn languages from an early age, thereby providing them with similar opportunities to those that are available to their counterparts in many other countries.</p><p>We need to recognise that multilingualism among children and young people is viewed as a norm in many parts of Europe in a way that is almost difficult to believe in Scotland. When I visited Luxembourg some years ago, I was astonished to see that almost every nursery school, it seems, advertises the fact that it is capable of operating in not two but five languages: Luxemburgish, French, German, English and the main immigrant language in that country, which is Portuguese. In Friesland, in the Netherlands, I know of at least one school where children are expected to be fluent in Frisian, Dutch and English by the age of eight. In France, they are rethinking their language teaching with a new plan that includes an increased focus on early years learning, on improving the language teaching skills of kindergarten teachers and on how primary school staff can learn language teaching skills from secondary school teachers.</p><p>By way of contrast, in Scotland we have seen a steady decline in the overall uptake of languages at secondary over a number of years. That is inconsistent with a modern globalised world in which people travel widely for jobs and leisure and speak several languages. I believe that it is now time for Scotland to create a cultural and educational environment that can help to attract children and young people to learning other languages; one that shows how languages can open doors to new cultures and literatures and that helps young people to see the world in different ways, as well as offering them many practical and economic advantages.</p><p>Many schools are already working hard to provide young people with opportunities to develop a deeper understanding of other cultures, both European and non-European, through the study of languages. In addition, over the past couple of decades we have developed in Scotland a successful example of bilingual education in the Gaelic-medium sector. We now have many excellent examples of Gaelic-medium education in schools throughout Scotland and our aim is to see that ideal promoted and expanded. We are also seeing young people using their Gaelic language skills in post-school education and in employment.</p><p>The introduction of Chinese into some of our schools and the contribution of the Confucius hub schools have helped many children and young people to develop a better understanding of a culture that is considerably different from our own, ranging from an introduction to tai chi, to an understanding of what it is like to be a pupil in China.</p><p>Confidence in languages can lead young people to form strong relationships with their peers in other countries, as pupils at John Ogilvie high school in South Lanarkshire have done with young people in Spain. Such examples show that it is possible to overcome the cultural, societal and attitudinal barriers to language learning that we often encounter in Scotland.</p><p>As a Government, we recognise the possibilities for young people&#8217;s life chances that come from learning other languages. We want schools to work towards a new model of language learning and teaching that is based on the mother tongue plus two additional languages, as first set out in the European Union&#8217;s Barcelona agreement of 2002. We acknowledge that this is a bold and ambitious objective&#8212;one to be delivered over several years.</p><p>The languages group has come forward with 35 recommendations. I am grateful for the work of Simon Macaulay, who chaired the group, and to all those who contributed to its deliberations. The group has sought to strike a balance between the level of ambition that a 1+2 model represents and an honest critique of where we are starting from.</p><p>I asked for a radical report, and the group did not disappoint me. I welcome the group&#8217;s key messages: that Scotland can and must do more to provide our young people with a better language learning experience; that language learning is life enhancing and can enable our young people to participate more fully in a globalised society and economy; and that Scotland&#8217;s increasing diversity of languages, including Scotland&#8217;s own languages, should be celebrated.

The younger that we introduce language learning, the more receptive children are likely to be to it. Implementation of the recommendations around that will set a bold new direction for language learning in Scotland&#8217;s schools. The policy will help to reinforce the ambition for modern languages as expressed in the curriculum for excellence, which is about raising the bar, with all young people expected to reach at least the second level by the end of primary.</p><p>However, the group was aware that current experience has shown that modern languages, when left to primaries 6 and 7, can be vulnerable and are sometimes reduced to an add-on with limited input, which makes it very difficult to reach the desired level. Therefore, the group took the view that a new approach was needed, with language learning beginning in primary 1 and being embedded in the fabric of the primary curriculum. By the end of primary 7, having started vibrant language learning in primary 1, young people will have a deeper understanding of how language works, a deeper understanding of their first additional language, in particular, and better skills in talking, listening, reading and writing in the modern language than was possible previously.</p><p>We recognise that the proposals will set significant challenges for our schools. However, some schools are already providing earlier access to language learning and are offering more than one additional language. Only last week, I visited Sacred Heart primary school in Bridgeton, Glasgow, where I saw a deeply committed staff teaching not one but four modern languages, with all pupils learning at least one additional language from primary 1.</p><p>The group also recommends that young people should be introduced to a second language by primary 5. It proposes that that be done through a planned interdisciplinary approach to second language learning in primaries 5 to 7 and in the broad general education at secondary school. Initially, a second modern language need not be learned to the same depth as the first one but could be built on later, in the senior phase.</p><p>We recognise that an earlier start to language learning also raises challenges for schools&#8217; capacity to deliver. Some teachers may not have undergone language training and others may wish to update their language skills. However, we know that there is untapped potential in the system, with many teachers who are trained in languages not having the opportunity to make use of their current language training.</p><p>The Government has proposed a budget for developing the Scottish schools curriculum. Within that, and subject to parliamentary agreement of the next budget bill in 2013-14, we intend to provide initial funding of &#163;4 million on top of the &#163;4 million that is already provided to local authorities for languages to pursue our ambitious aims and to enable young people in primary 1 to start learning a second language.

I am sure that we are, despite&#8212;I regret to say&#8212;the occasional evidence of my ears to the contrary from some quarters this morning.</p><p>I welcome the reaffirmed support for curriculum for excellence that has been expressed today. Local authorities, nurseries, schools, colleges and their dedicated staff throughout Scotland have all made good progress in implementing curriculum for excellence, particularly in the past two years. Every time that I visit schools&#8212;a regular part of my job&#8212;I see that the new curriculum is already making a real improvement to learning and teaching.</p><p>As Ken Macintosh rightly stated in Parliament in March 2008,</p><p>&#8220;there has been broad political agreement on the aims and agenda of the curriculum for excellence&#8212;a move away from the dominance of exams and teaching to the test; a decluttering of the overcrowded curriculum; more room for teachers to teach&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 19 March 2008; c 7063.]</p><p>We must not forget those aims.</p><p>Although formal assessment for the qualifications is not intended to begin prior to fourth year, learning during the broad general education&#8212;up to the end of S3&#8212;will contribute to learning for the qualifications in S4 and beyond. Therefore, the implementation of the new qualifications for pupils who will be in S4 in 2013-14 is a key milestone in the implementation process.</p><p>Let me be clear: we cannot countenance wholesale delay of these qualifications. To do so would undermine the learning that our young people who are currently in S2 have followed since they were in primary school&#8212;a point that Marco Biagi made.</p><p>Hugh Henry said that we should not gamble with the future of our young people and nor should we. Delay would represent such a gamble. We should not underestimate the risks to learners that are associated with asking them to change a course that they have been on since 2009. The intermediates will not build on the curriculum for excellence-based learning that pupils should have experienced in S1 to S3, and those who call for a delay must remember that.</p><p>I feel the need to reiterate the point that we cannot run three examination systems simultaneously in Scotland, which, as the SQA has pointed out, is the implication of wholesale delay.

To respond to Neil Bibby on that point, 300 such events are planned around Scotland to help to achieve that, together with a deep audit that will involve speaking to all Scotland&#8217;s schools.</p><p>As Stewart Maxwell and Clare Adamson pointed out, we have heard, and continue to hear, many calls against any delay from parents, teachers, headteachers, directors of education and others.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662543", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to close for the Government in this debate on curriculum for excellence.

That was expressed at the time of the east Mingulay consultation and it is being expressed again about the Sound of Barra. Although I am bound by collective responsibility once decisions have been made, this one has not yet been made and, as a constituency MSP, it is my duty&#8212;until and unless a decision is made&#8212;to make clear what my constituents feel, as I have done for some years.</p><p>The process around the designations, which are driven by the EU habitats directive, has given rise to expressions of enormous concern in Barra. In its dealings with SNH, the community feels that its economic concerns are being ignored. It is important that the minister tells us tonight, for instance, how he intends to protect scallop dredging not just in the short term, but for future generations. Above all, my constituents have expressed a strong feeling of grievance at a process that legally considers only scientific questions, not economic ones. In that context, it is worth stressing that the very existence of a pristine environment is down to the fact that generations of islanders have treated their environment responsibly.</p><p>Some limited progress has been made. Most recently, I pointed out successfully to SNH that my constituents felt that it was ludicrous for SNH to include the Tr&#224;igh Mh&#242;r in the proposals&#8212;an area that contains none of the designated habitats or species but which includes the island&#8217;s lifeline airport. I am happy to say that SNH has changed that element of its plans. A concerted campaign by the community&#8212;some of whom are in the public gallery today&#8212;has led, over time, to SNH unusually publishing in advance advice that it would offer about the management of any MSAC in the Sound of Barra. That would now include undertakings for there to be no impact on creel fishing and that demersal trawling could continue away from the most sensitive habitats. However, in the mind of the community that raises the question of what, in any practical sense, the MSAC is meant to achieve in a community that has legitimate concerns about its economic future.</p><p>Some of the language in the motion is rather less apolitical than might be expected in a members&#8217; business debate. The accusation of &#8220;government-sponsored ... damage&#8221; to the people of Barra&#8212;in relation to an issue that was first raised by a Government 10 years ago&#8212;is so partisan that a response might be necessary.</p><p>The interest that some members have shown in supporting the cause stands in marked contrast with their record on the issue. For example, of the 27 responses to the consultation on the east Mingulay designation, only three came from political figures, who were the local MP, local councillor Donald Manford and me. All those responses said, as the member who lodged the motion just said, that it is no secret that the relationship between the community involved and SNH has broken down.</p><p>The MSAC designation that is proposed in the Sound of Barra has provoked strong feelings in the area. I hope that proposals such as that for a fish farm in the sound provide evidence that investment in the area will continue, but people in Barra have frequently questioned why we have a legal framework for designations that is&#8212;from the point of view of somebody who lives in Barra&#8212;inflexible and illogical.</p><p>I take part in the debate as the constituency MSP who represents Barra.

I also congratulate Sandra White on securing the debate, which has given us a chance to celebrate the achievements of one of the world&#8217;s oldest seats of learning&#8212;and, it would now seem, one of the world&#8217;s most popular, too.</p><p>Biased as I am in these matters, as a Glasgow graduate, I am happy to wax lyrical about the University of Glasgow and what an appealing place it is for any prospective student, and it seems that I am far from alone in that. To be number 1 in the UK for international student satisfaction is an accolade to be proud of. Indeed, it is but one more thing to add to the university&#8217;s many achievements since its foundation in 1451, which range from fostering the talents of seven Nobel laureates and being the home of Scotland&#8217;s first women graduates to ensuring the recovery of the stone of destiny in 1950.</p><p>Ms White mentioned the egalitarian and international traditions of the university. The ability to react to the needs of international students is, as others have mentioned, a key component of a successful university. It is encouraging to note that an impressive 96 per cent of the university&#8217;s international students agree that Glasgow is a good place to be.</p><p>In the interests of fairness&#8212;and speaking as someone who also enjoyed going to the University of Aberdeen&#8212;I am pleased also to agree with Mr Smith that it is not only Glasgow that has excelled in the recent i-graduate survey. All the institutions that took part in Scotland performed exceptionally well against institutions in the rest of the UK and other international comparators. Scotland scored above the UK and international averages on features such as campus environment, social and sports facilities, employability, visa advice, living costs and earning money.</p><p>As Joan McAlpine pointed out, Glasgow&#8217;s campus is not restricted to the city of Glasgow but includes places such as the Crichton campus as well. However, as Ruth Davidson reminded us, the impact of the university is primarily felt in the city. As Bill Kidd mentioned, that impact is an entirely positive one and there is no easily visible divide between town and gown.</p><p>Part of the university&#8217;s evident appeal to students is its world-class academic reputation, with a research base that includes pioneering work in the fields of medicine, engineering, ethics, physics and astronomy, as well as emerging disciplines such as bioelectronics, cell signalling and nanotechnology.</p><p>As the minister with responsibility for science, I am pleased to say that the Scottish Government will continue to maintain Scotland&#8217;s world-leading position in scientific as well as other fields of research and will take steps to maximise the contribution that that makes to economic growth.</p><p>The Scottish Government is investing record levels of funding in our universities. The spending review settlement increases our investment by &#163;327 million over the next three years, which represents real-terms increases of more than 5 per cent in each year.</p><p>It is worth highlighting that Glasgow has recently announced a number of international strategic partnerships with some of the top universities in the world. For example, the school of culture and creative arts at the University of Glasgow has entered an agreement with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC and George Mason University in Virginia, and the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning was present at the recent signing of an agreement between Glasgow and the University of Calcutta.</p><p>Those international links underline the fact that there are more than 40,000 international students from more than 180 countries studying in Scotland. It is no surprise that international students have been identified as key contributors to the Scottish economy and to the academic, cultural and social experience at our universities and colleges.</p><p>With regard to the points that Ms White and Mr Kidd raised about the UK Border Agency, the Scottish Government has raised those issues regularly with the UK Government on behalf of universities and colleges that have been in touch with us to express their frustration with aspects of current immigration policy.</p><p>I concur with the view that international students are an enormous benefit to Scotland. It is more than unfortunate that UK policy in this area has been at odds, in many cases, with the ambitions of universities. The impact of the attitude of the UK Government&#8212;both real and perceived&#8212;and the new rules around immigration in this area were raised with Mr Russell when he visited India recently. The Scottish Government is providing funding of up to &#163;100,000 to enhance the welcome facilities for international students. That indicates our very positive attitude towards them.</p><p>As members know, we are in the process of reforming our post-16 programme to create a more sustainable approach to funding post-16 education. We believe that that will create better life chances for all our young people. However, although we have to consider what happens in Scotland, we also have to consider Scotland&#8217;s place in the world and the impact that that has on our education system. We all have to engage internationally, and we must continue to review our aspirations and targets to ensure that they are relevant and reflect what is best for Scotland. I believe that education is at the heart of what we do and is the key to future economic success for Scotland.</p><p>The University of Glasgow clearly understands all that and continues to be one of Scotland&#8217;s greatest cultural assets. Like other members, I wish it every success for the future. If the opinions of its students are anything to judge by, being a student there is, above all, as much fun as it ever was.

A few years later, he commissioned the production of a new translation.</p><p>Of course, that was not the beginning of biblical scholarship in Scotland. The monastic tradition goes as far back as Iona, and in the scriptoria of our monasteries the Bible was copied out by hand, in much the same way as in the project that we are celebrating today.</p><p>James VI had an inclusive and moderate approach to biblical scholarship&#8212;an approach that he did not apply to all his areas of policy as king.

The King James edition&#8217;s robust narrative style and the power and beauty of its poetry have given a rich legacy to the English language, along with many familiar phrases and expressions, such as &#8220;a coat of many colours&#8221;, &#8220;the powers that be&#8221; and &#8220;fight the good fight&#8221;.</p><p>The Bible in general, and the King James version in particular, has had and continues to have a significant impact on Scottish history and culture. I wish to illustrate that by referring to a couple of areas in which the King James Bible has had an influence.</p><p>The first is education. Scotland&#8217;s ancient universities were established, in part, to encourage the systematic study of Christian teaching generated particularly by the study of biblical texts.</p><p>Later, the reformation of 1560 had profound implications for Scottish culture and especially for education. I realise that the way in which I phrased that omitted to describe Edinburgh as an ancient university. I hope that no one objects.</p><p>The reformation gave expression to a particularly dangerous idea, which was the right to question the authority and teaching of the church in light of the teaching of the Bible&#8212;a right that could be exercised only if there was widespread access to education.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the ideal of a national system of education, from parochial schools to universities, was set out by John Knox and others in &#8220;The First Book of Discipline&#8221;. The revolutionary ideal&#8212;a kirk and a school in every parish&#8212;took many years to implement; nevertheless it expressed a recognition of the importance of education, both for its own sake and to give everyone the opportunity to read the Bible. It also fostered a respect for education and learning that, as others have observed, resulted in 18th century Scotland boasting the highest standard of literacy in Europe.</p><p>The emphasis in the reformation on education and the right to challenge authority, whether the authority of the church or others, was a significant factor in the development of the enlightenment in Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish enlightenment was centred in the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen and its leading thinkers, such as David Hume, Adam Smith and Hugh Blair, taught Europe and America how to think and talk about the new areas of study, including economics, sociology and engineering.</p><p>Of course, the biblical tradition in Scotland has given rise to irreverent comment about the role of preaching in Scotland&#8217;s culture, not least the apocryphal story of the Scottish preacher who indicated that his sermon would be on the verse</p><p>&#8220;And it came to pass&#8221;,</p><p>with particular emphasis on the word &#8220;And&#8221;. There is also the story of the man from Scotland who was found on a desert island after some years on his own. He had built not one but two churches with his own hand, and he explained to his rescuers that one was the church that he went to and the other was the church that he did not go to.</p><p>All that aside, and some of that mockery aside, as Voltaire commented:</p><p>&#8220;We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation&#8221;.</p><p>A bible in the vernacular has played an enormous role in that.</p><p>Of course, the other area, aside from religion itself, on which the Bible has influence in Scotland is literature. The implementation of the ideal of a national system of education produced the literate public that was needed for that.</p><p>We can see the prevalence of the Bible in something such as Burns&#8217;s &#8220;Cottar&#8217;s Saturday Nicht&#8221;. As Murdo Fraser pointed out, there is allusion to the Bible throughout our literature.</p><p>James Robertson, in his short story &#8220;Bible Talk&#8221;, comments:</p><p>&#8220;&#8216;In anither thirty year,&#8217; Tam said, &#8216;maist folk willna ken the Bible. No like we dae. Naebody&#8217;ll ken the language, the stories, the allusions. I honestly dinna ken hoo they&#8217;ll mak sense o the warld. Literature, for instance. Hoo can ye read literature if ye dinna get aw thae allusions?&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Government recognises and values the transformative and lasting impact of the Bible in general and the King James version of the Bible in particular. For that reason, we welcome and recognise the work that the Scottish Bible Society and the Bible Society in England and Wales have done to promote the project.</p><p>Meeting&#160;closed&#160;at&#160;17:47.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22654915", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: People&#8217;s Bible"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Dave Thompson, as others have done, for bringing the debate to Parliament.

I emphasise that it is all of them: Scotland cannot afford to write off the ambitions of any individuals, communities or groups within its society. Approaches such as building new schools&#8212;as I saw this week with the beginning of the building of a new Auchmuty high school in Fife&#8212;and measures such as activity agreements that encourage and give confidence to young people who have not had opportunities during their secondary education or have become alienated from it all, play an important role in raising attainment and ambition, which are important to all Scotland.</p><p>That much was reflected in the tone of many thoughtful speeches in the debate. As we heard, improving attainment will encourage ambition in our young people. It will also enable them to develop the skills and capacities that are needed to fulfil their potential.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s priority is to ensure the best life chances for Scotland&#8217;s young people&#8212;to improve attainment and to do so by raising ambition. Members from all parties demonstrated that they understood that priority, although I think that Jenny Marra misunderstood it slightly. The Government is not saying that are no problems or that there is no room for improvement, but we are trying to be positive in the motion.</p><p>Positivity, apart from being a moral good in itself, is, as any teacher will tell members, much more likely to get results. Some of the Opposition members complained about benign motions; all that I can say is that benign motions may achieve more than malign amendments.</p><p>Ken Macintosh rightly made much of the importance of class sizes. They are part of a wider agenda for improvement. The Government will also focus on early years and embedding the GIRFEC principles. As members also rightly indicated, those principles have not been uniformly or universally applied. Ms Constance clearly indicated that the Government intends to put that right.</p><p>The successful implementation of curriculum for excellence is a subject in itself, as are post-16 opportunities, which are the subject of investigation by the Government at the moment, following the cabinet secretary&#8217;s pre-legislative statement on the matter.</p><p>Ken Macintosh made a point about class sizes. The fact is that the number of P1 to P3 children in classes of less than 18 is up 70 per cent. I realise that he may not want to give credit to the Scottish Government for that or to Derek Mackay for it in Renfrewshire, but it is a fact that cannot go unacknowledged.</p><p>As a minister with an interest in the tertiary education sector, I say to some of the Labour members in particular that the use of the word elitist helps no one. I say that because the Government clearly has a commitment to young people of all backgrounds. If that was not the case, we would not offer 25,000 new apprenticeships or guarantee 16 to 19-year-olds without work the opportunity of education or training.

I am happy to and think that it is important to acknowledge the realities of those inequalities. Participation rates in tertiary education have improved for the second year running, but I would like them to improve more rapidly.</p><p>John Pentland was right to make a point about improving equality of access to our tertiary education sector for young people who are from less wealthy backgrounds. He said that schemes had been abolished. I remind him that the Scottish Government has created two new schemes with the aim that he described&#8212;the schools for higher education programme and a scheme for access to the professions.</p><p>Articulation is an important part of what the Government is trying to achieve. We are trying to ensure that we do not stick to rigid and outdated concepts about how people will end up in higher education, for instance. We must be much more flexible about allowing movement between different forms of education and genuine lifelong learning. One aspect that will support that approach and encourage equality of access to tertiary education is that the Government has made it clear that higher education will be free in Scotland.</p><p>Derek Mackay, who was endorsed by several parties across the chamber, made the point that&#8212;at the other end of the educational experience&#8212;early intervention is important, as are activity agreements. Claudia Beamish was right to highlight the needs of specific groups, including students from ethnic minorities. Claire Baker talked about the importance of early years. I can only seek to reassure her that, as the Government will fund the early years task force with in excess of &#163;250 million, we should have confidence in what the Government seeks to do on early years.

Through positive engagement with community planning partnerships and other partners, we are making progress across the country on embedding the GIRFEC principles.

It would be fairly uncontentious anywhere else on earth, and it is this: that it is reasonable for anyone in any country to expect that school will give them access to and knowledge of their country&#8217;s culture.</p><p>I believe that premise&#8212;and I declare an interest, which my register of interests will show&#8212;as someone who is involved in various cultural organisations. I also believe it as someone who, for all the many good things about my experience of school, somehow managed to grow up in the same place as did both Sir Walter Scott and James Hogg without hearing either of their names mentioned in secondary school.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s commitment to Scottish studies in schools has sparked some intemperate language in the political arena. [Interruption.] I hear some from parts of the chamber already. Things have been said about this that I earnestly hope some politicians are suitably embarrassed about now. I note that the words &#8220;indoctrination&#8221; and &#8220;brainwashing&#8221;, for instance, are absent from the Opposition amendments&#8212;that much at least is to be welcomed.</p><p>Be in no doubt: the public has warmly welcomed the commitment to Scottish studies, with recent research showing a 90 per cent level of support. That is because the vast majority of people recognise that learning about Scotland&#8217;s history, languages, literature and culture should be an integral and natural part of a young person&#8217;s experiences. So we will strengthen the place of Scotland in learning through the curriculum, ensuring that all and not just some children and young people can access a distinct strand of learning about Scotland and Scottish culture.</p><p>Young people have an entitlement to a broad general education as part of curriculum for excellence. That must include enabling them to develop a knowledge and understanding of Scotland and its place in the world. Understanding Scottish culture and connecting with Scotland as a place through our landscape and natural heritage are an important part of developing a sense of worth, confidence and wellbeing&#8212;all the things that enable people to flourish in learning, life and work.</p><p>During the debate on the Scottish Government&#8217;s legislative programme on 8 September, Johann Lamont highlighted her experience from school as evidence that we need take no further action on Scottish studies. If Ms Lamont&#8217;s experience of the classroom, both as a pupil and as a teacher, was one where Scottish history and literature were taught, I warmly commend that. I do not doubt that over the years some young people have benefitted from first-class learning about Scotland, including Scottish literature, history and poetry. However&#8212;believe me&#8212;that simply is not the experience of everyone. The real point, which the Opposition amendments regrettably seem unwilling to accept, is that we have a duty to ensure that learning about Scotland and its culture is not a fortunate accident for some, but an expectation for all.</p><p>As to other objections that Ms Lamont raised in her remarkable contribution on 8 September, most notable was the claim that the Scottish National Party is hell-bent on trying to tell children that no bad landlord has ever been Scottish or that we want to write women out of Scottish history&#8212;I hardly know where to begin on that. Let me instead leave rebuttal to Dr Wilson McLeod, a senior lecturer in Celtic and Scottish studies, who said recently about Scottish studies:</p><p>&#8220;Far from giving a biased and nationalistic view of Scotland&#8217;s past, it could also pierce &#8216;romantic history&#8217; about the likes of Culloden and the Clearances&#8221;.</p><p>During the 2009 year of homecoming, we saw some wonderful examples of pupils learning about their country and its contribution to the world, including the winner of the homecoming Scottish education award: Iochdar primary school in my constituency. I hasten to add that it got that award before I became the Minister for Learning and Skills. At the end of it, young people in schools that had entered the competition for the homecoming award were asking why they could not have the opportunity to learn about Scotland every year. Well, we intend to ensure that such opportunities become embedded across the curriculum.</p><p>There is a strong sense of necessity here. Coherence, relevance, progression and depth are key principles in the new curriculum, and providing greater structure to learn about Scotland will be enabled by Scottish studies. We know from Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education reports that since 2007 schools have been developing approaches to planning the Scottish dimension in history that are more coherent. We consider it vital that that continues to be developed, not only in terms of history but across the curriculum. Proposals will therefore be developed and implemented in a way that strengthens curriculum for excellence, providing a more relevant and connected learning experience that raises ambition and attainment for all.</p><p>Earlier this month, I chaired the first meeting of the Scottish studies working group. The group has an excellent blend of experience and insight from the fields of academia, the Scots and Gaelic languages, literature, culture and, most important, teaching. We are privileged to have the Scots makar, Liz Lochhead, join the group, as well as the musician Phil Cunningham and Scottish literary authority Professor Douglas Gifford. There is a strong appreciation within the group of the value of ensuring that pupils can access learning about Scotland while avoiding any risk of marginalising Scottish subjects.</p><p>In taking this work forward, it is important to appreciate that we are not starting with a blank canvas. The place of Scotland in learning has been significantly strengthened through curriculum for excellence. There are many opportunities to develop relevant and engaging learning about Scotland and Scottish culture in curricular areas including social studies, through Scottish history, geography and modern studies; expressive arts; languages; and health and wellbeing.</p><p>Outdoor learning also provides an exciting opportunity to engage and inspire young people in a wide range of environments. This is not, as some commentators seem to have imagined, all about history.</p><p>Schools such as Carleton primary in Glenrothes are leading the way. Scottish culture at Carleton is organised thematically with each primary following a programme. I was also impressed by the cross-curricular approach being taken in Dunfermline high, which I visited earlier this month.</p><p>Let me stress one other thing: it is vital that Scottish studies underpins an international perspective as young people develop as responsible global citizens with the skills, knowledge, understanding and values to succeed in a fast-changing world.</p><p>The place of learning about Scottish history has been greatly strengthened in recent years through online resources and the introduction of the mandatory Scottish history unit in higher history.</p><p>During the last academic year, more than 20,000 young people throughout Scotland benefited from the heritage education travel subsidy scheme, which has opened up access to heritage education at sites including the new Robert Burns birthplace museum, New Lanark world heritage site, Bannockburn and Edinburgh and Stirling castles. I am looking to see whether Murdo Fraser is in the chamber. He objected to the scheme at the time. It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Scottish Government will continue its support for the heritage education travel subsidy scheme for 2012-13. Clearly, it is appreciated by teachers and young people alike.</p><p>Among many other aspects of Scotland&#8217;s culture, Gaelic is a vital part of what we are trying to do. Gaelic is one of our national languages and we have a collective responsibility to ensure that it flourishes. The recent survey of public attitudes to Gaelic made clear the overwhelming support for Scottish studies and showed that 81 per cent of the Scottish public feel that it is important that Scotland does not lose its Gaelic language traditions.</p><p>We should also recognise and value the place of Scots literature and language in Scottish culture and ensure that it has a firm place in learning. Practical steps include working with local authorities, national bodies and groups such as the Scots Language Centre, Scottish Language Dictionaries and the Robert Burns museum to support progress.</p><p>We will also look at how we can take forward the recommendations of the Scots language working group and are planning to establish a network of Scots co-ordinators in schools.</p><p>Clearly, the scope and range of Scottish studies is enormous throughout the journey through primary and secondary school. We therefore also expect there to be opportunities for learners to continue their studies within a Scottish context in the senior phase. That will include recognition of such learning within qualifications that incentivise progression and attainment.</p><p>There is a significant number of national courses that have opportunities and aspects that can be studied and assessed within a Scottish context. Those opportunities will be strengthened within the new curriculum for excellence national qualifications, which will be implemented from 2013-14.</p><p>We are also exploring the potential for a specific qualification in Scottish studies. Let me be clear&#8212;this is something that has caused much slightly ill-informed debate in the press&#8212;that the working party is keen to investigate a range of models. A qualification could, for instance, include recognising the study that young people undertake on Scottish themes across a range of subject areas and at different levels, but, as yet, the group has reached no conclusions.</p><p>All young people deserve the opportunity to learn about their country, and nowhere else but here would that be questioned. Those who still do might perhaps wish to consider taking a deep breath and turning away from their own constitutional obsessions for one moment. [Interruption.] Those people obviously recognise the problem that they have. They would see that Scottish studies is healthy, normal and supported by people across the political spectrum and across the world of education&#8212;it is also supported by parents.</p><p>There are good examples of embedding Scottish subjects into the curriculum in schools, but that is not being done everywhere across the country and we want all&#8212;not just some&#8212;young people to have a clearer understanding of Scotland and the world.</p><p>One of the wisest comments made in the press following some of the more hysterical political reactions to my initial announcement about Scottish studies came from a Mr Hugh Reilly. In his article in The Scotsman, Mr Reilly said that, for whatever it was worth, he viewed himself as a traditional Labour voter. He also said:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m speculating here, but Scotland must be the only country in the world where teaching children the history of their own nation is perceived to be treason. The idea that introducing Scottish Studies to the national curriculum is brainwashing our children is farcical beyond belief.&#8221;</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>Let us start being serious about the issue. Let today&#8217;s debate be the start of a positive recognition by the Parliament as a whole that every young Scot has a right to learn about their country and, through that knowledge, to learn about the many other peoples of the world. Believe me: there is a world out there that regards all this stuff as pretty normal and, in Scotland&#8217;s case, long overdue.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament welcomes the 90% level of support for Scottish Studies in a recent survey; agrees that it is essential that all young people should have the opportunity to learn and be better informed about their country and its place in the world, including its historical, literary, linguistic and cultural inheritance as well as its landscape and natural heritage, and that such learning provides a more relevant and connected learning experience that raises ambition and attainment for all, and supports the Scottish Government&#8217;s desire to develop a distinct strand of learning around Scottish Studies for all pupils in the context of the Curriculum for Excellence, providing greater coherence without marginalisation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22652307", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Studies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In opening the debate for the Government I will admit a rare thing in politics, which is that I care fairly deeply about whether the Parliament intends to accept the premise that I put forward today.

That is as it must be. Recovery is self-evidently critical to Scotland&#8217;s success and is the route to improving the lives of millions of our people.</p><p>The measures that the First Minister set out have a very practical edge. They are about economic success through jobs for the people of Scotland. Capital investment, improving access to finance and restoring business and consumer confidence are all central to attracting new businesses to Scotland and supporting the businesses that are already here&#8212;particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>I want to talk about a particular group of Scots. As we look forward to the next five years, we must pay particular attention to our young people. That is why we are committed to opportunities for all&#8212;a place in education and training for all 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in a job, an apprenticeship or education. The economic downturn has meant that we cannot but take the issue seriously and do something about it. Despite the constraints placed on us by decisions taken outside Scotland, we will act decisively to provide our youngsters with an opportunity to overcome the barriers that they face. We must offer a range of high-quality provision that is underpinned by the personal and financial support that young people need to succeed. That is why we have maintained our position on higher education tuition fees, despite the scale of that undertaking, and why we are committed to delivering 25,000 modern apprenticeship opportunities a year during the parliamentary session.</p><p>The Government understands the value to Scotland both culturally and economically of a new generation of Scots who feel confident about their own culture and its value to the wider world. For that reason, I would prefer not to embarrass the Opposition parties&#8217; education spokespeople&#8212;unless they want to raise the issue themselves&#8212;by reminding members of the hysterical response with which they recently greeted my announcement on Scottish studies in schools. I am actively working to ensure that a strand of Scottish studies is embedded in the educational experience of all our young people. I am prepared to assume that Ken Macintosh does not now regard it as corrupting the young for them to be taught about Keir Hardie, and at least Murdo Fraser seems to be fully signed up to the idea of introducing a module on the Scottish Conservatives into higher history. Therefore, I trust that cross-party support will now abound.</p><p>Yesterday, the First Minister spoke about our goal of ensuring that there is an inclusive education system that improves life chances for all. That is why our commitment to delivering free higher education is more than just a policy position for this Government: it is an example of how we have connected with the values of the people of Scotland and prioritised their ambition. Our belief in the people of Scotland means that we will continue to put decision making into their hands. That is exemplified by our approach to reform and the reorganisation of many other areas of public life, not least health services. The focus in the programme for government on early detection and patient-centred care places the individual at the centre of their own health service. Putting the individual at the centre of the design and implementation of the services on which they rely in all spheres is critical to the successful delivery of public services in modern Scotland.</p><p>It must be said that, at a time when another Government is cutting Scotland&#8217;s resources by &#163;1.3 billion, it is essential that we focus on delivering better outcomes from the resources that we have. That is why we will take forward significant programmes of reform in critical parts of Scotland&#8217;s public services, such as police and fire services and post-16 education.</p><p>Members should be in no doubt that we believe that Scotland could do much more if the levers of economic power in Scotland had handles in Scotland. That is why other parties may rest assured that this Government will ensure that the people of Scotland decide their own constitutional future. For now, however, we will make sure that the economic argument for independence is put to the people of Scotland. We will make it firmly and we already make it with increasingly good reason for confidence. We understand that delivering on our current programme will be critical in making that case&#8212;a case that we offer today to the chamber and to the people of Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650216", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Legislative Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In opening today, I first offer my apologies to members for not being able to stay for the whole debate due to ministerial engagements in the course of the day.

Of course, that was at a time when the education system also sometimes suggested that epilepsy was a mental illness. However, the cross-party group often hears evidence that the teaching profession&#8217;s knowledge of epilepsy could still be much improved.</p><p>I developed epilepsy when I was at secondary school, but I never had a seizure in school, so I cannot make many comparisons. For an anecdote about an inappropriate response to an epileptic seizure in an education setting, I have to turn to my time at university. I am sad to say that I recall that at a meeting of the student wing of the Scottish National Party in the University of Aberdeen, I had a seizure just as we were about to vote on some matter of internal politics that probably seemed vital at the time. I remember regaining consciousness after several minutes only to hear those at the meeting arguing earnestly about whether I could vote while unconscious, on the basis of the stance that I had taken earlier in the debate. I do not suppose that that was a textbook way to deal with the situation, but it is nonetheless an interesting question in its own right.</p><p>In primary schools, one of the arguments that was once offered against including children with epilepsy in mainstream education was that it would be distressing for other children to see someone have a seizure. Of course, the reality is that children get used to almost anything very quickly if they are not given reason to panic, but that, in turn, implies that the teacher knows what to do. As Mr Gibson&#8217;s motion states, the key is to &#8220;normalise the condition&#8221; before children have a chance to stigmatise it, which requires some basic understanding on the part of teachers.</p><p>Many teachers show such understanding, but it must be acknowledged that epilepsy takes many forms. Some forms of what used to be called petit mal epilepsy are easily mistaken for nothing more than very long lapses in concentration. I know of at least two children who went undiagnosed for years, because teachers just thought that they were not listening.</p><p>More positively, there is clearly a willingness on the part of many teachers to learn about the basics of what to do and what not to do in the case of tonic-clonic seizures. There is a similar willingness to find out about medication and the very individual warning signals of an oncoming seizure that many children will have.</p><p>Such increased awareness among teachers can only help to ensure that children with the less obvious forms of epilepsy get the early diagnosis that affords them the best possible chance of finding medication that will minimise symptoms.</p><p>If teachers are able to find out about all that as a routine part of their training, it would certainly help, as would on-going awareness raising for existing staff. It will be interesting to hear from the minister what is already happening in this area.</p><p>I congratulate Mr Gibson on focusing our attention on a condition that is remarkably common but still remarkably misunderstood. Following the launch in the Parliament only a few days ago of a guide for employers and employees on how to deal with epilepsy in the workplace, it makes sense to promote today a similar understanding in Scotland&#8217;s schools of the condition. I am sure that the Parliament will welcome further progress.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22645239", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Epilepsy Awareness Training"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As co-convener of the cross-party group on epilepsy, I thank Kenneth Gibson for securing a debate on this most important issue.

That tells its own story. As others have pointed out, in the islands a car is essential for practically anyone in employment and anyone with a young family. In many cases, it is even essential for pensioners who just want to get to the nearest shop. People who would not consider owning a car in the cities realise that they have to have one in the Western Isles, or in other island communities.</p><p>Public transport does exist there, and it is certainly used. However, with most villages having typically half a dozen buses going through them each way a day&#8212;if that&#8212;trying to fit the needs of a job or a family around bus services is no simple matter. To ask people in the Western Isles to do without cars entirely would, if I may put it as dramatically as this, be to ask them, essentially, to accept the travel patterns of their grandparents&#8217; generation&#8212;three or four trips a year to Stornoway, followed by one permanent journey to Canada.</p><p>I say these things not as a petrolhead by any means&#8212;lest I be called that. I do not drive a car on the mainland, which is possibly just as well for people there. I did once drive a car from Inverness to Ullapool, I concede, but I have no immediate plans to repeat anything of the kind again. I fully and enthusiastically accept the need to reduce our car use. However, we must also accept that, in some parts of Scotland&#8212;not the bits that are responsible for the vast bulk of our carbon emissions&#8212;if there is an alternative to the car, it has not yet made itself known.</p><p>For that reason, people in the Western Isles have not been slow to record their views about fuel prices. I wrote to my constituents on the issue some time ago and got almost 5,000 replies on the subject. A petition was raised locally and was taken to the Parliament&#8217;s Public Petitions Committee. It was signed by something like a quarter of adults in the islands. It resulted in correspondence between the Scottish and UK Governments, in which, somewhat laughably, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, argued against a cut in fuel duty in island areas, claiming that it would create what he called &#8220;perverse incentives&#8221;&#8212;presumably for people in Glasgow to drive to the Western Isles to fill up their car.</p><p>We are still waiting for the present UK Government to make good on its promise&#8212;which is very welcome, I must say&#8212;made many months ago now, of a 5p cut in island petrol duty. Notwithstanding the complications that have been described, I counsel the UK Government that a hope long deferred maketh the heart sick.</p><p>As everyone knows, the price of petrol has gone up through the VAT rise, ensuring that those who already pay most for their fuel now pay most tax, too. There is as yet no sign of a fuel tax regulator and it is disappointing&#8212;indeed, somewhat incredible&#8212;that the Labour amendment seeks to remove all reference to that regulator from our motion. I hope that Labour candidates in the Highlands and Islands are well briefed on how to explain that one away.</p><p>I accept that tax is not the only factor in the price of island petrol. The lack of competition among the companies that deliver and supply fuel to island petrol stations&#8212;I am not thinking internationally, but locally&#8212;is not healthy. Indeed, as other members have mentioned, the Office of Fair Trading has taken some interest in the matter.</p><p>However, tax is an important factor and, regrettably, the UK Government still determines the tax on fuel and receives that tax, just as it receives tax on the companies that operate in the North Sea. My colleagues in the House of Commons are busy today tabling amendments to the Scotland Bill to put that situation right but until it is, this Parliament still has an opportunity to argue for a fairer deal for those who really do rely on the car. That means arguing that the UK Government should cut the rate of island fuel duty, abandon its planned duty increase and introduce a fuel duty regulator. Any party that does not argue for those things tonight will rightly be strongly criticised in the communities that I represent.</p><p>For all those reasons, I urge members to support the Government motion and to vote against the Labour amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2011-03-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22645441", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fuel Duty"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree that this is a problem that afflicts all the islands and many other areas of rural Scotland.

Failure to maintain adequate records meant that a generation of our most vulnerable children were failed, and failed for the rest of their lives, by the hopeless record keeping of many institutions in the past. As the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee heard in distressing evidence, that meant that many people who were formerly in the care of such institutions were, in later life, completely unable to piece together the stories of their lives, their family origins or the reasons why they ended up in care, far less to be in an adequate position to investigate any failures or abuse that may have occurred in many cases. From that evidence, the committee concluded that we have a</p><p>&#8220;strong moral obligation to manage personal records effectively.&#8221;</p><p>Although those very unhappy stories provided the springboard for the bill, the legislation takes the opportunity to impose standards of record keeping across a wide range of authorities. The Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee took evidence on the bill and we were convinced, despite the misgivings of some witnesses, that it provides a proportionate solution.</p><p>Part 1 of the bill will require the production and implementation of a records management plan, to be approved by the keeper of the records of Scotland, by named Scottish public authorities. As other members have said, the keeper will design a model records management plan, with best practice advice and supplementary guidance, to deliver to authorities. The bill will further guarantee the keeper the ability to carry out compliance reviews of the plan&#8217;s implementation by authorities. The keeper may also issue warning notices and take related measures to ensure that the management plan&#8217;s provisions are being observed. During evidence, the keeper concluded that, from the review, an understanding had been gained that there were widespread inconsistent record-keeping practices throughout Scotland.</p><p>The Scottish Information Commissioner stated during his evidence that, under current record-keeping regimes, finding many records is like</p><p>&#8220;looking for a needle in a haystack.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee,12 January 2011; c 4504.]</p><p>He made it clear that many organisations, not least some of Scotland&#8217;s local authorities, could make very significant improvements in their record-keeping practices.</p><p>Other witnesses were of the view that the schedule of the bill is perhaps disproportionate and covers too broad a range of organisations, and they offered the view that there should be a differentiation between high risk and low risk records management. The General Teaching Council for Scotland, for instance, argued that the bill will place significant burdens on public authorities and questioned whether the bill will deliver appropriate compliance that would be proportionate to the costs.</p><p>However, others persuaded the committee of the position that organisations should keep accurate records no matter how small in scale and scope, and that organisations that keep reasonable records have little to fear from the legislation. Having said all that, I welcome the minister&#8217;s indication that at stage 2 she is willing to return to some of those concerns and to engage with them.</p><p>The bill requires the public authorities that are listed in the schedule of the bill to</p><p>&#8220;produce, implement and review records management plans.&#8221;</p><p>Once the public authority has developed a records management plan, it must be approved by the keeper of the records of Scotland. The bill aims to ensure that records are organised and easily accessible for public review.</p><p>The plan describes the arrangement of records not only by the authority but by contractors who carry out any function of the authority. That point is central to the scheme that is set out in the bill and it is why contractors&#8217; records are to be included in an authority&#8217;s records management plan. Although the committee wants to be reassured that that will not impose new and unreasonable burdens, it was again broadly persuaded of the need for that aspect of the bill.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s financial memorandum states that bodies that have credible records management plans will likely face only minimal costs as a result of the legislation, which also seems to committee members to be broadly credible.</p><p>The Public Records (Scotland) Bill has been deemed important because it holds public authorities accountable for the storage of information, which is often information on individuals. I hope that a reform of the public records system will ensure that significant public records are no longer filed away in unmarked boxes in lock-up storage centres, put in skips or given away to random passers-by, as happened in the worst examples that were brought to the committee&#8217;s attention.</p><p>Good records management will, as has been stressed throughout the process, give much clearer guidance to authorities on what can be thrown out and, indeed, on what must be thrown out if records are to be kept in an intelligible form. I hope that the bill will achieve not only the end of protecting Scotland&#8217;s children, but of a much wider reform that will allow sensible and proportionate record keeping by all of Scotland&#8217;s public authorities. In that spirit, I urge the Parliament to support the principles of the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644527", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Records (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Despite its unprepossessing name and content that will never make a newspaper editor hold the front page, the Public Records (Scotland) Bill is, for good reasons that other members have alluded to, deeply important to the lives of many people in Scotland.

It is clear that in Scotland the consequences of the plans would be felt particularly acutely. By that, I mean not only that the cuts would be felt by the people who would lose their jobs&#8212;although they certainly would be&#8212;but that they would be felt by everyone who cares about safety at sea.</p><p>The proposal is to cut the five current coastguard centres around Scotland to just a single full-time station, probably based in Aberdeen, with a further additional station, based in either Shetland or Stornoway, that would operate in daylight hours only. I believe that the great strength of the campaign that has been mounted against the cuts is that it has not taken the bait offered by the MCA in the proposals&#8212;the premise that one coastguard station should be pitted against another. In that spirit, I thank all members who have signed my motion or who intend to take part in this debate, particularly those, such as Tavish Scott from Shetland, who have interests in specific coastguard stations. The point of the campaign is not that Stornoway is a more necessary centre than Shetland or vice versa&#8212;both are needed.</p><p>Under the MCA proposals, in hours of darkness, a call from any vessel in distress anywhere around the UK coastline and far out in the north Atlantic would be directed either to Aberdeen or to the new station at Southampton or Portsmouth. All connections between coastguards and a specific area of the coast would be lost. That might make sense to an accountant somewhere, but consider the following real incident. Some time ago, an indistinct call came in to the Stornoway coastguards. Perhaps bizarrely, it said simply, &#8220;I&#8217;m on the Chicken.&#8221; Anyone with local knowledge will understand that the call was from a vessel that had gone aground on the Chicken rock, near Stornoway. I can tell anyone who is interested afterwards about the series of mistranslations by which the rock, which has claimed lives in the past, got its unusual name. However, the material point is that, with the best will in the world, I find it difficult to believe that a centre on the other side of Scotland or on the south coast of England would readily have been able to decipher that message.</p><p>Countless other such confused situations can be envisaged. Which Tarbert? Which Scalpay? Which Berneray? If we bring Orkney and Shetland into the equation, which Mainland? Come to think of it, there is a Chicken rock off the Isle of Man, too.</p><p>Local knowledge is required of coastguards for a reason. That is why the MCA&#8217;s own rules for staff specifically make local knowledge subject to continuous examination. I find it difficult to see how that aim can possibly be reconciled with centralisation of staff on the drastic scale that is proposed or, indeed, with the reduction in the overall number of staff who man coastguard centres in the UK from 491 to 248.</p><p>I can understand the need for economy, but I also understand what a false economy is. At its most dramatic, a false economy is trying to mop up the mammoth financial, environmental and potentially human costs of an oil tanker going aground. In case that sounds like a dramatic example, let me say that the MCA acknowledges that many of the risks of such a scenario occurring are increasing: weather patterns are more unpredictable, vessels are larger, the seas are busier and an increasing number of incidents are being reported.</p><p>In my own area, in 2008, 2,095 vessels transited the Minch. By 2010, the figure had risen to 2,442. During 2010, the emergency towing vessel that is based in Stornoway was tasked with escorting shipping through the Minch 115 times&#8212;not to mention the recent occasion when she had to shove a nuclear submarine off the end of the Isle of Skye. My mention of the towing vessel is topical, because in the last few minutes I have learned that today a Tornado with two of the cabinet secretary&#8217;s constituents on board crashed into the Minch. Mercifully, the cabinet secretary&#8217;s two constituents ejected and survived, but the point is that the emergency towing vessel is currently on the scene gathering wreckage from the incident.</p><p>However, at the same time as all that has happened, and at the same time as dramatic reductions to coastguard centres are proposed, we learn that the UK Government is also proposing that those self-same tugs be disposed of, which would mean that, in the future, the nearest suitable tugs for the Minch would be in the Clyde or the North Sea. I know that other parts of the country have similar concerns.</p><p>There is yet another factor in all of this: the role of the volunteer coastguard rescue service, which does everything from cliff rescue to searching for missing persons. The existence of a staffed coastguard centre acts as a major factor in attracting and maintaining the large pool of volunteers who are needed for such tasks. Areas that lose coastguard centres stand in danger, over time, of losing many of their volunteers, too.</p><p>In conclusion, I will not argue for the coastguard service based on the needs of the staff and families who would be most affected or on the impact that job losses might have in rural areas, because Whitehall is clearly not interested in listening to them, important though they are. Instead, I hope that I have made&#8212;and that other members will make&#8212;a case that is based on solid arguments of public safety and on what I believe is the compelling idea that the coastguard service should be comprised of staff who have local knowledge.</p><p>One question that I have been asked again and again, by many of those who would be most affected, is why the coastguard service is still run by the UK Government when so many other aspects of marine policy in Scotland are Scottish run. That is a good question. For the moment, however, even if it does not run the MCA, I welcome the strong support that the Scottish Government is giving to the campaign and the representations that I hope it will now make to the UK Government. I call on Parliament as a whole to implore the MCA and the UK Government to abandon these flawed and dangerous proposals.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643628", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Coastguard Centre Cuts"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency has proposed a series of cuts to the coastguard service that can only be marvelled at for its sheer lack of logic.

However, the bill has at its core the concept of public benefit. For instance, it will explicitly enable the Scottish ministers to recover grants in the event that specific preconditions of those grants are violated. That is one of the many examples of how the bill takes a responsible stance on public expenditure.</p><p>One innovative aspect of the bill on which I would like to dwell briefly, as other members have done, is the inventory of important Scottish battlefields. There was discussion in the committee and elsewhere about vexed questions of definition and disputed locations of battlefields. I can think of one such dispute in my constituency that led ultimately to the comment by one person whom I know that, if the battle had taken place on the site that was suggested, any graves would long since have fallen victim to generations of peat cutting.</p><p>Those occasional difficulties of definition aside, however, it must ultimately be a positive step to recognise formally the existence of battle sites that are of national importance. The inventory of battlefields will give formal recognition for the first time to those sites, many of which are central to Scottish history and, in some cases, to our existence as a nation.</p><p>We are fortunate that some battlefields, such as the scene of King Robert the Bruce&#8217;s victory at Bannockburn during the wars of independence, have a memorial and a visitor centre and are well known to the public. Incidentally, and unsurprisingly, I do not share the well-publicised horror that some members have expressed that schools run school trips to see Bannockburn and are encouraged to do so by the Scottish Government.</p><p>However, many battlefields are less well known and have been subject to various changes in land use and to uncontrolled metal detecting, which can raise archaeological as well as ethical questions. An inventory of battlefields will start to address those issues, but in a pragmatic way. If a battlefield has been ploughed or grazed since the day after the battle took place, which most of the ones in Scotland probably have been, there is no suggestion that the bill seeks to get in the way of agricultural activity continuing.</p><p>It is clear that there is wide support for the bill. The Built Environment Forum Scotland, for one, has strongly endorsed it, saying that it will go &#8220;a significant way&#8221; to ensuring consistency between elements of the historic environment legislation and the planning regime, as others have pointed out. The organisation points out that even if Scotland&#8217;s built environment did not have an incalculable cultural value, it makes an enormous contribution to our country&#8217;s economy.</p><p>The bill is a reasonable and sensible means of updating and clarifying in law the protection that, as a country, we rightly extend to our built heritage.

I hope that I may therefore be permitted to stray a little from the spirit of Labour's motion and talk instead about another subject, which should be of interest to us all, namely education.</p><p>The Government's amendment lists some of the reasons&#8212;it is not an exhaustive list&#8212;as to why Scotland has positive reasons to be proud of its education system and its educational achievement. Of course there are many things that we can seek to improve, but much work is being done that deserves to be celebrated. Others have already touched on many of those areas&#8212;the increase in nursery entitlement, the re-establishment of free tuition at university, the extension of the entitlement to free school meals, <place-holder colnum=\"32156\"/> the promotion of Scottish literature and history in schools and, perhaps most telling of all, the fact that we have never had a higher proportion of school leavers going into work, education or training.</p><p>However, I will focus on one area that means a lot to me: the future of rural schools. I declare an interest in that I went to a primary school in the Borders with a roll that fluctuated between a dozen and two dozen&#8212;a school that subsequently closed. [<em>Interruption</em>.] I do not know why George Foulkes laughs&#8212;I can assure him that it was not under the current Administration.</p><p>The Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Act 2010&#8212;legislation that was brought forward by the current Government&#8212;recognises, without in any way minimising the importance of all schools to their communities, that another factor comes into play in rural Scotland. If a rural community loses its school, a question arises as to whether that community can survive as more than a designated retirement zone. The 2010 act is clear in giving ministers the power to call in school closure decisions by local authorities where the Government believes that material factors have not adequately been taken into account during the council's closure process. Crucially, those factors include whether the council has really considered alternatives to closure and whether attention has been given to the economic and social consequences for the affected community.</p><p>Yesterday, above all the irrelevant baying and yelling of some members, we heard crucial evidence of that legislation being put to work and a clear sign of the Government's commitment to ensuring that rural schools are given a fair chance. I am pleased to say that the education secretary announced that, as well as calling in a school closure decision in Shetland, he had used his powers under the act to keep four schools in the Western Isles open. With the Parliament's forbearance, I will pay tribute to the campaigns that were run by those four communities.</p><p>First, I pay tribute to all those in the west side of Harris who argued so strongly that the local council had no right to close their school without heeding the Herculean efforts that were being made there to ensure a future for their community, which deserves the description \"fragile\" more than any other place I can think of in Scotland. The decision to keep the school open will serve as a significant boost to all those who are seeking to bring new life to the place following a successful community buyout.</p><p>Lionel and Shawbost are two schools in the north and west of Lewis where secondary 1 and 2 pupils are taught locally rather than being sent on the long journey to Stornoway. Despite two successive attempts to close those secondary <place-holder colnum=\"32157\"/> units in recent years, the communities have won their argument. I have seldom seen a larger or angrier crowd of people in the Western Isles than in Carloway recently, where people were arguing passionately for the role that their school has in ensuring that there is life in the west side of Lewis.</p><p>In the Western Isles, like everywhere else, there is a recognition that schools cannot have an eternal guarantee about their future and that some schools will have to close. However, schools deserve a chance. I do not relish falling out with my local council, which I believe exercises sincerely its difficult task as an education authority in difficult times. However, I believe that the minister was right to intervene in the four cases that I have mentioned. I doubt that many people in the west side of either Harris or Lewis would disagree with me on that.</p><p>We can justly be proud of Scotland's new legislation on rural schools. We should celebrate many things about our education system. We should celebrate the more than 300 school building projects that have been completed since May 2007, which have lifted about 120,000 pupils out of poor conditions.

I welcome it first, and most important, because I want to see Scotland take more control of our own affairs. I genuinely&#8212;as opposed to just tactically&#8212;want to see our national Parliament take more legislative and fiscal responsibility away from another place. So the fact that we are discussing a bill that, however limited in its scope, talks about those ideas is something that I hope all parties can now regard positively.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell might fear that the bill is a Trojan horse for Scottish independence. I can reassure her that, wary as I might be, I do not intend to spurn unionists bearing constitutional gifts, however modest those gifts might be.</p><p>The fact is that this bill represents a long overdue, if grudging, recognition from certain quarters that Scotland's constitutional future matters. It matters because, without power, we cannot act to address our country&#8217;s social and economic problems. The only question is, of course, how much power do we want our country to have? Everyone knows my preferred answer to that question, and it involves, among other things, repealing schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998.</p><p>However, rather than each of us reiterating our preferred party positions, our real challenge, if we choose to accept it, is to find agreement as a Parliament. That means that we have to start from the reasonable position that, just like any other, the bill is capable of constructive improvement.</p><p>There is much in the bill that we can all seek to build on. There are, however, undoubted anomalies that I believe that we must correct. Some of the anomalies have been well rehearsed, but that is no reason not to repeat them. I am pleased, for instance, at the bill&#8217;s devolution of powers on speed limits. However, as Christine Grahame asked, can anyone tell me why, if I speed in my car, my crime is a devolved matter but, if I am towing a caravan at the time, my crime is a reserved one? At the level of principle, however, what is more important is the question of the various powers that the bill envisages this Parliament giving up. I know that the SNP is not the only party that, at the time of the establishment of the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"31385\"/> Parliament 11 years ago, would have struggled to imagine us now debating the merits of handing back powers to Westminster. I therefore urge members of all parties to consider how far it might be consistent with self-respect to envisage measures that take us down that route.</p><p>The bill envisages all sorts of currently devolved activities being un-devolved, such as the regulation of various medical professions, aspects of charity law and insolvency law. As many people have mentioned, it seems that the bill even envisages reserving penguins, through its references to Antarctica, which suggests a certain degree of obsession on the part of its framers.</p><p>More contentious than anything else, however, is the shape of the bill&#8217;s proposed tax powers for Holyrood.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21137349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate, much as the tone of the motion rather assumes that I will not.

No Westminster Government would contemplate trying to operate without some discretion over corporation tax, for example, not to mention some of the smaller taxes that even Calman&#8217;s tame report recommended be devolved, including air passenger duty and the aggregates levy.

However, they are anything but a formality to Scotland's coastal communities. More than anything else, the talks speak eloquently of the dismal failure that is the EU common fisheries policy. It is a failure not only for the industry, but <place-holder colnum=\"31032\"/> for conservation, as the policy's trademark&#8212;discarded fish&#8212;bears witness.</p><p>However, one thing has been changing for the better in recent years. It has been recognised that, despite the institutional failures and the reservation of key negotiating powers to Westminster, Scotland's Government has been playing a more vocal role than previously in defending the interests of Scottish fishermen.</p><p>My few remarks today will display the west coast interests that befit my constituency, but I hope that they may also have wider relevance.</p><p>If we are to overcome the shameful situation of discards and cope with the reality of quota cuts, we have to adopt a catch less, land more approach. The European Commission must also accept that Scottish fishermen are already leading Europe in conservation measures. Those efforts deserve recognition.</p><p>West coast fishermen have particularly grave doubts about the west coast catch composition rules, although that matter may not be discussed fully until next year. I am hopeful that, in the meantime, the cabinet secretary will continue to negotiate hard for Scotland's role in the cod recovery plan not to involve an unrealistic or unfair share of the associated pain.</p><p>For the nephrops sector, which is key to the fishing industry in my constituency and elsewhere on the west coast, it is also essential that the risks associated with the subdivision of the seas into functional units be assessed. Whatever happens on that point, there now seems to be a scientific rationale not to repeat the scale of last year's cuts to the nephrops total allowable catch. Although the current relatively low take-up rate of the nephrops quota on the west coast would allow any cut this year to be a paper cut to some extent, we must also start to plan for the time when the sector starts to grow again and not leave ourselves without the people and the capacity to allow that.</p><p>The fisheries talks are as important this year to coastal communities as ever they were. They highlight the human cost of Scotland's relative lack of say in decisions that need to be made more locally to a far greater extent.</p><p>I will say a word in support of the community in Barra, which continues to argue against another inflexible aspect of European legislation that will, potentially, have an impact on fishing&#8212;and much else&#8212;on the island: the proposed marine special areas of conservation in east Mingulay and the Sound of Barra.</p><p>Barra is a powerful example of the important role that fishing can have in maintaining populations in fragile communities. It is also a good case for repatriating to Scotland, and to <place-holder colnum=\"31033\"/> fishing communities themselves, as much as we can of the decision-making process that affects those communities' livelihoods.</p><p>As in every year, the next few days are essential to ensuring that Scotland's fishing communities have the future that they deserve.

A dynamic education does far more than provide a better future for individuals: it provides an enhanced future for all Scotland. The strength of our education system impacts directly on our future prosperity, and it is essential that we do everything in our power both to maintain and to improve Scotland's education system.</p><p>Strangely enough, at least three current members of this Parliament were taught by one fine teacher at Selkirk high school who managed to include in his lessons welcome digressions into fields as varied as linguistics, literature, history, etymology, modern languages, science, the guitar, English grammar, art, current affairs and the satirical songs of Tom Lehrer, including his notable 1960s hit \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\". Somehow, amid all that, he managed to find the time to get us through higher Latin and O grade Greek.</p><p>That was certainly immensely memorable, but it was deliberately not in any obvious isolated silo of educational experience. I wonder how easy it would have been to teach in that way latterly in the overexamined, overmeasured and overfragmented system that many have argued Scottish education became to some extent in recent years. If we are to correct that tendency and allow teachers scope again to teach in a more natural cross-disciplinary way, we have to embrace the curriculum for excellence.</p><p>The curriculum for excellence breaks down barriers in education. As it does so, it seeks to provide the children of Scotland with a better-rounded education and to help them to grow both academically and personally. The curriculum for excellence also seeks to adapt the education system to provide more meaningful academic growth to its students. By breaking down barriers between academic disciplines, the initiative creates a better-rounded, multidisciplinary approach to education, especially at primary school level. It gives teachers greater freedom to create experiences for their pupils that make lessons more interesting and effective. Such reforms create a curricular structure that allows for flexibility and adaption at classroom level. By providing that flexibility, we grant our teachers the freedom that they need.</p><p>The curriculum for excellence will also provide a better environment in which the children of Scotland can experience growth on a personal level. The curriculum ensures that students are provided with the tools and opportunities that they <place-holder colnum=\"30326\"/> need to develop and grow as citizens and it seeks to provide a system that encourages that. Indeed, there is evidence that the new curriculum is having an effect in surprising ways, such as in new Edinburgh school buildings that are now physically being designed around the new curriculum.</p><p>Before we descend further into party camps on the issue, I point out that the curriculum for excellence is neither the brainchild nor the burden of any single party. All parties acknowledge&#8212;or should acknowledge&#8212;that the process that led to its creation began under a Lib Dem-Labour Administration, seven years ago, and that it has fallen to an SNP Government to implement it. Nobody disputes the considerable work that implementing the new curriculum has meant for teachers; however, we have heard relentless negativity in some speeches. In fact, if it were a temperature, it would have plummeted beyond mere negativity during Mr McNulty's speech and reached absolute zero.</p><p>The Government has responded to teachers' demand for a recognition that they must be allowed to teach and that the days of top-down direction on every aspect of their teaching lives must be brought to an end. The Scottish Government has also sought to address issues that the teaching unions have raised around the implementation of the new curriculum, which is reflected in the unparalleled involvement of the teaching profession in that task. That has included the funding of the implementation partnership and the creation of four new in-service days with targeted support through HMIE. Most substantially, there has been an additional implementation year: despite the siren calls, the time for implementation is now upon us.</p><p>Nobody pretends that implementation is a simple task, but the wisdom of going ahead is testified to in the comments of Irene Matier, of the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland, in <em>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</em> on 4 June:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are hearing more and more accounts of the really positive impact Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) is having on schools, teachers and pupils. In particular, many teachers report that they are actually enjoying the job much more than before.\"</p><p>Liz Cameron, of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said in the June 2010 issue of \"Business Scotland\" magazine:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Curriculum for excellence's approach in nurturing successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors offers great potential for developing the kind of young people we need&#8212;both as entrepreneurs and as employees.\"</p><p>It is now essential that we move forward and that Scotland acknowledges that we possess a dynamic cutting-edge education system that <place-holder colnum=\"30327\"/> incorporates new reforms and targets for both academic and personal growth. We live in a rapidly changing world in which we must regularly adapt our approach to education. Only through a willingness to change constantly in that way and to improve our education system can we properly prepare the children of Scotland to live and work within that ever-changing world. Unless someone in the chamber has a better idea, the curriculum for excellence presents overwhelmingly our best prospect of achieving those goals and deserves all of our support.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21069683", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Curriculum for Excellence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a Parliament, our greatest single responsibility is,   arguably, to do everything in our power to ensure&#8212;to put it rather grandly&#8212;that tomorrow is better than today and to ensure that Scotland's children have the most dynamic, memorable and mind-broadening education possible, and not just that they pass some exams.

Nevertheless, it sometimes needs to be explained to visitors and, indeed, to Scots themselves that Scotland does not have all those historic buildings by mere accident; they are there because, as a nation, we have actively chosen to maintain them.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank rightly mentioned the Callanish stones as an example of an outstanding historic structure. The story about the councillor in the 1960s who wanted to knock them down to make room for council houses may well be apocryphal, but it nonetheless eloquently conveys its own warning from our country's recent architectural and planning history.</p><p>Maintaining historic buildings is not a simple matter, and it is certainly not the same as merely preserving ruins. The historic environments in question have often moved beyond their original purposes and evolved into repositories of local and national identity but, in general, they cannot do that very effectively unless they are also given a continuing useful purpose in the community.</p><p>One of the most contentious issues is a philosophical one. Should a historic building be preserved in aspic and, if so, at what stage in its history should that happen? The example&#8212;which, this time, is not apocryphal&#8212;comes to mind of the <place-holder colnum=\"30092\"/> proposal in regard to a historic building in my constituency that the temporary Perspex sheeting over a broken window should be preserved as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"part of the development of the building's recent history\".</p><p>Maintaining historic sites is anything but simple and it needs to be, at least in part, a pragmatic business.</p><p>Just as our historic environments have evolved to serve new purposes, the legislation that has been designed to protect and preserve them must evolve as well. We must remain flexible and willing to adapt our approach to suit new developments and realities.</p><p>The bill reflects such a practical approach. That much became clear during the evidence that the committee took, and it is reflected in the support for the bill that has been expressed across the political divide. Our consideration of the bill made for some of the more unusual evidence that the committee has heard, which covered subjects as varied as the disputed location of various battlefields, speculation on whether Prince William might get engaged in Fife and the need to preserve the cobblestones in Kelso square. Mercifully, the latter did not become the subject of a paving amendment.</p><p>The bill will amend current processes to provide greater protection for Scotland's historic environments. By targeting weak points and gaps in existing legislation, it will allow Scotland to better safeguard and preserve its heritage while utilising the strengths of existing frameworks and institutions.</p><p>One of the great strengths of such an adaptive approach is the minimisation of costs and burdens. The bill will considerably improve our historic environment protection strategy without encumbering public and private stakeholders in the historic environment sector with enormous new financial or logistical burdens. The utilisation of existing frameworks and institutions will mean that such an approach will have minimal financial cost.</p><p>The bill will explicitly enable Scottish ministers to recover grants in the event that the specific preconditions of those grants are violated. Such a measure, although not entirely new, will help to ensure that expenditure on historic sites can always be demonstrated to have a public benefit. In a time of cuts to the money that is available to Scotland, that is an important consideration, and the bill exemplifies the taking of a responsible stance towards such public expenditure.</p><p>Another important aspect that has been looked at is the need for the bill to be responsive to stakeholders and complementary to other on-going efforts in the sector. Thanks to the <place-holder colnum=\"30093\"/> invaluable contributions of interested parties, including the owners of historic homes and gardens and a variety of agencies such as the National Trust for Scotland and Historic Scotland, a bill now exists that is highly responsive to the concerns and needs of those who seek to preserve Scotland's historic environments. The bill strengthens and standardises enforcement measures that are intended to protect historic environments, and implementation of the new measures will ensure that historic buildings receive more comprehensive protection.</p><p>Consultation also allowed the proposed legislation to be drafted in a way that complements existing non-legislative endeavours and brings Scottish policy into harmony with European initiatives on the protection of heritage sites. The bill is constructed in a manner that complements endeavours such as the welcome efforts to make Historic Scotland more accessible and adaptable as an institution. It also makes Scottish policy concordant with Council of Europe initiatives on the designation of archaeological heritage.</p><p>By ensuring that the proposed legislation remains complementary to existing work, we are able to ensure that it will form part of a cohesive approach to the preservation of historic environments that gives serious thought to the future. That will ensure the survival of our historic sites for future generations. In the years to come, the new practical considerations might force us to fine-tune our approach again. However, with the bill, we have taken an important practical step.</p><p>Our wealth of historic treasures is an irreplaceable asset, but it carries a burden of responsibility. As a country, we neither shirk nor resent that burden; indeed, we proudly accept it. The Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill is our instrument to act on that responsibility, and I commend it to the chamber.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21055678", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Historic Environment (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a nation that is rightly proud of its heritage and history, Scotland possesses a robust system for the protection and preservation of historic structures and landmarks.

I intend, however, to be back for the closing speeches.</p><p>The refreshed skills strategy is, first and foremost, a recognition of reality. The original 2007 strategy is useful and wide-ranging. Needless to say, however, the economic climate has changed so dramatically since then that it would be remiss not to return to it in light of the circumstances. We have a pressing responsibility to ensure that Scotland's real and present skills needs are met. As the report says, the purpose of the strategy has not changed in the past three years, but the scale of the challenge has increased as a result of the economic depression.</p><p>In any case, there could scarcely be a more important subject for us to revisit than this. The strategy is about accelerating economic recovery in Scotland. More to the point, it is about improving the life chances of thousands of individual Scots.</p><p>The commitment to 20,000 modern apprenticeships and a total of 40,000 training opportunities this year is impressive. As well as 15,000 modern apprenticeship starts there will be, among other opportunities, 5,000 all-age modern apprenticeships. That will be particularly appreciated in my part of Scotland, among many others, because in those areas it is often people in a slightly older age group in the workforce who need new skills, rather than those who are in the age groups that are covered by more traditional apprenticeships.</p><p>In marked contrast to all that stands the gap between the rhetoric and the reality of Labour's record in government on apprenticeships. Between 2004-05 and 2007-08, Labour presided over a year-on-year reduction in the number of new apprenticeship starts, which declined from 21,349 to 15,772 over that period.</p><p>The Scottish Government is now, however, devoting real attention to upskilling the Scottish workforce, recognising that the only way for Scotland to make a speedy exit from the economic downturn is for us to be globally competitive. That is reflected in the fact that, despite the pressure on Scotland's budget, the Government has devoted an extra &#163;75.5 million to lifelong learning in this year's budget.</p><p>That investment is paying off. By anybody's measure, Scotland's skills position has strengthened since 2007. Just as the percentage of the population with a degree has increased, so has the percentage with mid-level qualifications. Perhaps even more significant, the percentage of the population with no qualifications has decreased. That trend will have to continue if we <place-holder colnum=\"29486\"/> are serious about changing the kind of economy that Scotland is, even within the limitations of the fairly short economic levers that presently are at Scotland's disposal.</p><p>It is likely that ours will increasingly be an economy in which it will not be easy to get a job without qualifications of some kind. People who have become unemployed in, perhaps, semi-skilled work will struggle to find such work available to them in future. The needs of people in that situation, whatever their age, must not be overlooked. That means that there is a constant need to provide training, skills and qualifications.</p><p>To achieve that continuous improvement, the strategy places an emphasis on four areas: empowering people, to ensure that they have the opportunity to access the right advice, support and opportunities; supporting employers, by better understanding and assessing the skills that they need for future success, and ensuring that the supply of skills, training and qualifications can be responsive to that; simplifying the skills system, to ensure that it is more coherent and easy to understand; and strengthening partnerships and collective responsibility between the public, private and third sectors.</p><p>Broad though those headings sound in themselves, it is clear that the strategy points to specific measures that are, in turn, aligned towards addressing a problem that Scotland has not yet solved: translating the increase in the skills base into higher productivity and economic growth. If that tells us anything, it is that, despite progress, we still have a long way to go. Scotland will be looking closely at the UK Government's 2010 spending review for many reasons, one of which is that Scotland needs to know what impact decisions that are made at Westminster will have in the longer term on what Scotland has to spend on skills and training. The false economy of cutting too deep and too quickly would be illustrated if the Westminster Government created more pressure on the budgets that we allocate to the very activities&#8212;the provision of skills and training&#8212;that are most likely to bring our economy out of recession.</p><p>The Scottish Government has produced a reinvigorated skills strategy that is designed to take account of Scotland's changed economic circumstances.

He has a great interest and wide knowledge in Gaelic broadcasting, and that was evident today.</p><p>We have an opportunity tonight to say congratulations to BBC Alba after two years of broadcasting. It has performed very well indeed. Looking back to the first programmes of BBC Alba, it is hard to believe that it is two years from that memorable night when it put that programme about Elvis on. If BBC Alba proves one thing, it is that Gaelic is suitable for any subject under the sun, from football to drama&#8212;and perhaps Russell Brand. This is an exclusive for Mr Brocklebank: the programme that he mentioned will include me.</p><p>Because BBC Alba is not on Freeview yet, it can be seen on only one out of three Scottish TVs. That is a big obstacle for the station but, despite that, many people are watching BBC Alba. A quarter of a million people regularly watch the channel.</p><p>However, without a place on Freeview the channel depends on freesat and Sky. As the Gaelic proverb goes, people in Barra have Sky TV, but nobody at all in Sky has Barra TV&#8212;something is lost from that in the translation, I admit.</p><p>Two years ago, there was great hope that the BBC trust would rule on the Freeview question before the end of 2010. I am willing to believe that the trust has good intentions for BBC Alba, but we are still waiting. I hope that the trust will come to a conclusion shortly about the question, following its consultation on the public benefit of BBC Alba.</p><p>I will not run through the cultural and economic arguments in favour of BBC Alba. However, we need quickly to deal with the arguments against Freeview. Calm down, TaxPayers Alliance.</p><p>The trust has one piece of advice about that, which has appeared in the papers. That is that the BBC network radio stations should not broadcast on Freeview while BBC Alba is on air. Mr Brocklebank dealt with that argument well. One or two newspapers made quite a big deal out of the issue, but nobody is saying that the radio stations will cease to exist; they are just saying that they <place-holder colnum=\"29364\"/> will be broadcast only on traditional radio, DAB digital radio and online, instead of through television. There is no evidence that big numbers of people listen to those stations through the television. The majority of people will agree that Freeview is there for television in the first place, not radio. If Freeview was for radio, it would have a different name.</p><p>I congratulate BBC Alba on its second birthday and I hope that we will see it shortly on Freeview.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21006655", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: BBC Alba"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Anns a' chiad dol a-mach, bheir mise taing mh\u00f2r do Ted Brocklebank airson an deasbaid seo a chumail.

Legislation is a necessary condition, but it is not sufficient.</p><p>It seems a long time since the previous Scottish Executive appointed Professor Shucksmith's committee of inquiry into crofting. Much in the Shucksmith report was of value, but the report and the draft crofting reform (Scotland) bill that followed it contained some proposals that were unworkable. I am not alone in having spent much of the past year lobbying for many provisions in the draft bill to be changed. Forthright public meetings and conversations with innumerable individual crofters in my community reinforced to me the point that large sections of the draft bill were&#8212;if I may put it like this&#8212;of little use to man or beast.</p><p>The substantial response to the Government's consultation did not offer a unanimous view, but it is clear that it influenced the Government's decision to alter the bill substantially before it was introduced. The most contentious proposed sections&#8212;those on area committees, residency requirements and standard securities&#8212;were not in the bill as introduced. After much amendment, the bill as it stands concentrates on addressing speculation and dereliction, keeping inby land in crofting and ensuring that the crofting commission is more democratic and effective.</p><p>I take the opportunity to seek assurances from the minister on two points that constituents still raise with me. In the light of this morning's debate, what is the Government doing to bring down further any costs and fees that crofters might incur in relation to the register of crofts? Will the Government say more about its re-examination of the support that is provided for crofter housing? <place-holder colnum=\"28191\"/></p><p>Having an inadequate house continues to be a major obstacle to many crofters.</p><p>I am sure that, for my urban colleagues, the vast number of amendments to the bill today had all the appeal of a large cloud of midges, but they were important to my constituents and they all made substantial contributions to the debate. We might not agree with all the amendments that were made today but, after the marathon that the bill process has been, it should come as little surprise to hear the minister say that the chances of any Government legislating on crofting in the foreseeable future are slim.</p><p>Let us all be honest with ourselves as we approach decision time. Another crofting reform bill is not just around the next corner. If we do not pass the bill at 5 o'clock, no elections to the crofting commission will take place. Without the bill, no action will be taken to protect crofting land from the worst effects of speculation; no measures will be taken to reverse the infamous Taynuilt or Whitbread precedents, which have done much to take inby land out of crofting use; and the commission's role in dealing with absenteeism and neglect will not be clarified.</p><p>Of course the bill will not please everyone in every respect. I have mentioned issues on which the Government has still some way to go to reassure crofters. However, now that all the studies, the reports, the consultation and the amendments are over, the Parliament has a duty to act tonight. Some of our differences have been genuine; some have&#8212;no doubt&#8212;been manufactured. Regardless of that, we have a duty quietly to lay those differences aside and to get on with the task in hand.

I could not fail to be impressed by the time that the panel gave to ensuring that the needs of the young person were listened to, understood and acted on. It makes me wonder with a sense of dread what we did before we had children's panels.</p><p>I do not think that any of us in the chamber, least of all those of us who are on the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, take lightly the task of legislating anew in such a sensitive area of Scots law. However, the Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill has the significant purpose of strengthening and modernising that unique system to ensure that the needs of children remain central.</p><p>It is important to remember who the bill will affect: it will improve the level of support to our most vulnerable children, of whom 47,000 were referred to the children's reporter in 2008-09.</p><p>The bill aims to strengthen the children's hearings system by providing improved support for professionals and panel members and by introducing national standards. Combined with the quality assurance and the accountability that the bill creates, that approach will ensure that the system can deliver national consistency in approach and practice.</p><p>The Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee took evidence on the central aims of the bill and, although it made recommendations on a number of detailed areas of the proposed legislation, it supports the bill's principles.</p><p>Through the creation of the new national organisation, children's hearings Scotland, and its post of national convener, the bill will create new national standards for the statutory work of the <place-holder colnum=\"27338\"/> children's hearings system. It is appropriate that the new organisation, which is designed to support the work of local children's panels, should be created when we consider that the children's hearings system is the biggest tribunal in Scotland, but is the only one without a national body to support its work. Given that the system is largely delivered by volunteers, it becomes apparent why a body such as children's hearings Scotland is necessary. The committee has made clear its view that further discussion is needed of the exact role of the national convener, and the Government has clearly indicated its willingness to engage on that question.</p><p>The bill also seeks to streamline processes and procedures in order to improve understanding and use of the system throughout Scotland under the oversight of children's hearings Scotland. That includes aspects such as the recruitment, selection, training and continuing support of panel members using nationally agreed standards. The establishment of children's hearings Scotland will help to deliver the change that is needed to create the standardised approaches. I am pleased that the submission to the committee from the children's panel chairs group during the committee's consideration of the bill said convincingly that 86 per cent of panel chairs support the new body's establishment.</p><p>I note that the bill provides for the establishment of area support teams by the national convener of children's hearings Scotland in consultation with local authorities, which will ensure that local government is wholly involved in the delivery of the system.</p><p>The bill also introduces a permanent legal representation scheme that will enable legal representation to be made available to children through the normal legal aid system. That scheme will ensure that children have access to supportive state-funded legal representation. There was discussion in committee and outside about the need to avoid undue intrusion of the adversarial side of the legal system into hearings, but the committee agreed that sufficient safeguards are in place and that the times when legal advice is sought will be relatively rare, notwithstanding the important distinction that Elizabeth Smith makes between legal advice and legal representation.</p><p>The fact is that some attention to the current legislation is needed to avoid issues arising from the European convention on human rights. Our system in Scotland has to stand up to the various tests that the ECHR applies to such questions as conflicts of interest and the separation of roles.</p><p>Finally, the bill will, I hope, improve the flow of information. There has been some discussion about that point this afternoon, but it is important that the bill improve the flow of information not <place-holder colnum=\"27339\"/> only to children but back to panels. The so-called feedback loop that is proposed will, I hope, address the complaint that I have heard from many panel members that, at present, they often do not get to know in detail whether their findings have been implemented in full and whether the interventions that have been made have actually helped the child.</p><p>The bill has been the subject of significant consultation. As others have observed, what it proposes is certainly not the same as what was proposed in the draft bill in June last year. Indeed, discussions at a Scottish Executive level about reform go back to at least 2003, and the process of parliamentary scrutiny is not over. I believe that, if we are to support children's panels more fully in their work of ensuring a better chance in life for Scotland's children, the bill deserves our support.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20850582", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As other members have rightly observed, Scotland is justly proud of its children's hearings system, which was founded in the belief that the primary purpose of the law as it relates to children is to ensure that they are protected and given a fair start in life.

I will not rehearse all the reasons of geography and history that have made that the case, but it is worth giving one single illustration of the economic importance of the sea to Scotland: our shipbuilding industry, which could once boast that a third of the ships afloat in the world had been built on the Clyde.</p><p>I represent 13 inhabited islands and it is only too obvious to me what the sea means to Scotland. A high proportion of my constituents have either served across the globe in the merchant navy or are fishermen, or they work in fish processing, on ferries, or in the tourism industry in and around the sea. Conversely, as in many other coastal communities, people in the islands are only too aware of the terrible power of the sea. Taking one famous and terrible example, His Majesty's yacht Iolaire sank barely a couple of miles from Stornoway harbour in the early hours of new year's day, 1919. With the loss of more than 200 men, most of them soldiers returning home from the trenches of the first world war, the tragedy remained for many decades an event so painful in Lewis and Harris that it was barely discussed.</p><p>I mention that because it goes a long way to explain why people in places such as the Western Isles often have a realistic, rather than romantic, view of the sea. I also mention it to stress that the sea is not just an ecosystem that is vital to life on earth&#8212;I apologise for the word \"just\" in that <place-holder colnum=\"26862\"/> sentence, now that I read it, considering the enormity of what it says&#8212;we need also to recognise the importance of the sea to human cultures all over the world. World oceans day provides an opportunity every year to do just that. It provides a chance to honour the world's oceans and to celebrate the products that the oceans provide. It also gives us time to appreciate the sea's intrinsic value and the need to protect it.</p><p>Pollution of the sea is a global problem, but one with intensely local manifestations in the form of the tonnes of plastic that wash up on Scotland's beaches every year. Indeed&#8212;this does not bear much thinking about&#8212;there is evidence that many beaches around the world contain almost as much ground-up plastic as they do sand.</p><p>World oceans day provides an opportunity to get hands on in protecting our future with a new mindset, through personal and community action and involvement. Beach clean-ups, education programmes, art contests, film festivals, sustainable seafood events and other planned activities help to raise consciousness of how our lives depend on the oceans.</p><p>Sustaining the natural marine environment while supporting Scotland's vital oil and gas and fishing industries is a major challenge, but I am intensely optimistic, as I am sure are other members, that the sea provides the key to many of Scotland's most immediate needs. The heavy Atlantic swell and some of the world's strongest tides are to be harnessed by a breakthrough scheme to generate clean marine energy off northern Scotland. The scheme's output is predicted to rival that of a nuclear power station&#8212;that is before we consider the contribution of smaller wave-powered projects and offshore wind.</p><p>World oceans day offers a fitting moment for Scotland to look ahead and think about what we can do for our oceans and what our oceans do for us. There is wider and wider recognition that communities that have traditionally made their living from the sea and people who are concerned about the wider ecological role of the world's oceans can, and increasingly do, work together in pursuit of a shared goal. For that reason, I support world oceans day and commend the aims of the motion.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20816822", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World Oceans Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Stuart McMillan on securing this evening's debate.

It will be of much more interest to the people of Scotland if we each show some willingness to listen to a debate on which there is, surprisingly, at least some common ground. If members will allow me a Hebridean analogy, our common ground is perhaps like the apocryphal disputed peat bank: it has been the subject of a tense stand-off for decades; it is the object of deeply entrenched positions; and it is narrow. However, it is in everyone's interests that the Scottish and UK Governments speak to each other constructively now that proposals for constitutional change in Scotland are on the table once more. The challenge is to come up with legislative measures that will work.</p><p>The Queen's speech talks about implementing the Calman commission recommendations, and there is evidently willingness on the part of both Governments to continue a dialogue about what that might mean in practical terms. There is no doubt that for those of us who see Scotland's destination as independence, the Calman proposals do not take the political temperature in Scotland anywhere close to the flash-point of heather. However, although, as I and other nationalists have said before in Parliament, we recognise that there are elements of the Calman <place-holder colnum=\"26647\"/> proposals that are good and worthy of implementation, the proposals are neither indivisible nor sacrosanct. I suspect that mine is not the only party in Scotland that takes that practical point of view.</p><p>The fact that the UK Government is prepared to repatriate to Scotland legislative competence in areas such as drink-driving, speed limits and air-guns is to be welcomed. In as far as those issues go, those are highly reasonable proposals. My colleague Dave Thompson has been active among members of all parties in his support for the Scottish Parliament to have control over drink-driving law. Likewise, many have campaigned hard for Holyrood to legislate on air-guns. Further, it seems strange for a country with its own legal and criminal justice systems not to be able to legislate on something as everyday as speed limits. However, Calman is more problematic when he talks about fiscal powers. If I thought that Calman was proposing fiscal autonomy or anything resembling it, I would have no such reservations, but I am afraid that in his fiscal proposals, Calman has simply not presented a coherent picture.

There is little point in rehearsing those differences; indeed, the report manages to sidestep them to some extent. As has been obvious from the debate, different members will, depending on their political standpoints, make greater or lesser allowance for the role of the UK Government in determining what Scotland has available to spend on its local authorities. In a sense, it would be more interesting to be having this debate after rather than before the UK Government's budget statement next month, to see what that leaves us to divide up, but we will let that be.</p><p>I wish to concentrate instead on two areas&#8212;first, the impact of the local government financial situation on the voluntary sector and, secondly, the opportunity for local government to carry out its economic development role.</p><p>The voluntary sector was the subject of a number of the committee's evidence sessions, firstly on the issue of voluntary sector pay. We <place-holder colnum=\"26356\"/> were prompted by petition PE1231, which called for a national framework for public service contracts to ensure equitable wages and conditions for front-line workers in the local government and voluntary sectors. There was acknowledgment from all sides that it was difficult to foresee how complete parity could be achieved in the current financial climate, but the Scottish Government indicated that it was committed to improving the situation.</p><p>Incidentally, the issue of the voluntary sector featured in the committee's work a year ago when we undertook the evidence sessions that have been mentioned on home care services for the elderly. Perhaps one of the most important outcomes that the committee has achieved this year was an undertaking from the Scottish Government that the use of so-called reverse e-auctions would be banned in the future when it came to procuring services for such vulnerable people.</p><p>More generally, the inquiry provided a chance for the committee to examine the impact of the current economic situation on the voluntary sector. The committee heard evidence on the issue and recommended that there should be better information on the comparison between the services provided by the third sector and those provided by the public sector; again, the Scottish Government responded to that positively.</p><p>Other evidence that the committee heard revealed the difficulties that are faced by a number of major charitable trusts, such as the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland. It pointed towards the possibility of what members have referred to as a \"perfect storm\" for the voluntary sector, in which both public and charitable sources of funding come under pressure.</p><p>It is worth focusing on the impact of the current economic situation on local authorities' ability to perform their important role in promoting economic development. In the round-table discussions, some witnesses cast doubt on the ability of local authorities beyond our biggest cities to undertake that role adequately. The Scottish Government responded by indicating its willingness to listen to further arguments and to review the current business gateway contract.</p><p>Following further examination of the contracts that were let in 2007, the business gateway Scotland board is now considering the arguments for refocusing the business gateway advisory and specialist support services. The Scottish Government is also considering other options in that area.</p><p>Other members have picked up on a wide range of themes in the committee's report.

It is vital that we ensure that a new generation enters crofting, that crofting is adequately supported and that it is allowed to develop and diversify. Let us be honest. A bill is not a sufficient condition for bringing in anything like all that renewal&#8212;no one is suggesting that it is; the point has been well made by other members&#8212;but it is a necessary condition for beginning such progress.</p><p>In a sense, the Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill is a tale of two bills: the draft bill and the bill as introduced. The bill that we are debating this morning is emphatically not the draft bill, which, for very good reasons, caused some anxiety in crofting communities such as my own. The Government has consulted extensively and clearly listened to what crofters have had to say and the bill before us is significantly different in scope and content from that originally proposed.</p><p>As members will know, the bill no longer talks about standard securities or proposes that crofters take out loans against their tenancies; no longer asks local authorities to police decrofted houses to ensure that people are residing in them for more than a specific number of nights in a year; and no longer contains contentious proposals for area committees to take on much of the Crofters Commission's work. The costs associated with the proposed crofting register have been significantly reduced from &#163;250 per crofter to perhaps half that&#8212;or potentially more than half that, if some of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee's <place-holder colnum=\"26150\"/> suggestions on community-based mapping are pursued.</p><p>I welcome the committee's report on the bill. Although in many areas members were far from unanimous in their views, the report provides a starting point for further rational debate. In my view, that means a bill that democratises the commission and puts crofters themselves in the majority. It also means a commission that can sensitively but authoritatively handle instances of croft neglect. The bill must ensure that, in all cases, land is being put to what the bill calls \"purposeful use\", either by the crofter or a subtenant.</p><p>The committee's report will help to guide debate in many specific areas. For instance, the committee's welcome for the principle of elections is a positive step in itself to increasing participation in and engagement with the commission, something that the committee has also advocated.</p><p>On the crofting register and the mapping that will be required to achieve it, anything that can be done to minimise costs in this area is to be welcomed. In that regard, the committee's proposals for encouraging community-based mapping are worthy of further consideration and the minister's comments about delaying the trigger-based system for a year to facilitate and encourage community-based mapping exercises are very positive.</p><p>However, if the bill is to achieve anything, it must empower the commission to deal both with speculation and neglect, and I am glad that the committee has recognised those points. With regard to speculation, the willingness of the Government and the committee to empower the commission effectively to overrule planning decisions that sanction the unnecessary removal of good inby land from crofting use is a positive development and deals with the infamous Taynuilt precedent.</p><p>The committee's report seeks further detail on how the Government intends the crofting commission to distinguish various types of absenteeism in future. That information might further reassure many crofters about what the measures on absenteeism mean for them, particularly those who have had subtenants working their land for a long period.</p><p>In at least some areas, there is unmet demand for land from would-be crofters, although the situation differs from area to area. The committee's suggestion that local lists of such people be kept is certainly of interest, although an assessment would have to be made of whether everyone on the list was fully committed to what they were potentially taking on. However, that is another useful idea.<place-holder colnum=\"26151\"/></p><p>Finally, like the committee, I believe that there is a need to close the so-called Whitbread loophole&#8212;or the Cunningham-Whitbread loophole, as it was referred to earlier&#8212;which relates to the sale by nominee of croft land. The Parliament will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to take up the challenge to elaborate on that fully, beyond saying that I intend to lodge an amendment to close the loophole. Many crofters have mentioned to me that that would be an important way of dealing with the unnecessary removal of land from crofting use. I welcome Mr Scott's comments about such an amendment, although I should clarify that, rather than deal with clawback periods per se, my intention is to frame an amendment that limits the rights of crofters to appoint nominees from outwith their family. I believe that that is a good way of dealing with some of the problems that the loophole has created.</p><p>The bill deserves to proceed to stage 2, as there is now a clear wish for legislation among crofters. We can identify improvements, amend the bill and debate the issues further.

In addition to an existing installed capacity of 1.3GW of hydroelectric schemes, Scotland has an estimated potential of 36.5GW of wind power and 7.5GW of tidal power, which is 25 per cent of the estimated total capacity for the European Union, and&#8212;I can go on&#8212;up to 14GW of wave power potential, which is 10 per cent of EU capacity. <em>Scotland on Sunday</em> reported in March 2010 that Scotland's renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60GW or more, which is considerably greater than the existing 10.3GW capacity from all Scottish fuel sources.</p><p>Much of that potential remains untapped, but continuing improvements in engineering are enabling more of the renewable resource to be utilised. However, as many members have said, the current transmission charging regime is not helping us to get there. The system was designed for another time and another set of problems. Locational signals mean that generators in southern England, including, rather surprisingly, coal and gas plants, are subsidised to connect to the grid when renewable energy installations in Scotland face heavy charges.</p><p>I hear what members say about the multiple facets to this debate, but consider some concrete examples, some of which members have mentioned. In 2010-11, Whitelee, a wind farm in the south of Scotland, will pay &#163;4 million in charges, whereas Langage, a 905MW gas power station in the south-west of England, will receive a &#163;5.3 million subsidy. Meanwhile, Scottish Renewables has calculated that marine energy projects in waters off the coast of Scotland face paying as much as &#163;50 million a year to connect to the national grid, while some energy schemes in the south-west of England could receive, as members have said, an annual grant. Under the UK's current transmission charging scheme, which is calculated according to location, projects in areas such as Orkney face paying as much as &#163;42 per kilowatt for the privilege of connecting to the grid, while others could be subsidised.</p><p>I could go on with such examples, but let me confine myself to saying that Scottish Renewables has calculated that Langage, which is a 905MW combined cycle gas turbine plant, is entitled to an annual subsidy of &#163;5.3 million under the current system, while marine energy projects located in the Pentland Firth and Orkney may have to pay for the privilege of transporting electricity to UK households.</p><p>Niall Stuart, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, is on record as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Marine energy offers massive environmental and economic opportunities for Scotland. We should be doing <place-holder colnum=\"25499\"/> everything we can to support and nurture this new industry rather than putting hurdles in their way.\"</p><p>He went so far as to say that the national grid's location-based model is inconsistent with the UK Government's drive to source a greater share of the UK's energy from renewable sources:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"These figures show that transmission charging is swimming against the tide of every other government policy designed to support the growth of renewables ... Fossil fuel plants in the south of England are receiving heavy subsidies from the current system.\"</p><p>The point is not only that the system is obviously unfair to Scotland and to a lesser extent to the north of England, but that, because so many of the renewable opportunities in the UK are in Scotland, it is bad for renewables at a UK level, too.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763615", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transmission Charging"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Representing, as I do, a constituency that regularly, and not without some reason, boasts some of the best waves and wind in Europe, I often find myself speaking to people who are trying to set up community wind turbines, and in one case a community-owned wave power project.

I need to do that because Scots have traditionally learned abnormally little about their <place-holder colnum=\"25458\"/> history at school. A friend of mine recently questioned with me the wisdom of the Parliament marking something as bloody and divisive as the Scottish reformation. It became clear that he was thinking not of the Scottish reformation, but of the English one and of events in Ireland some 100 years later. It would be utterly wrong of us to overlook the fact that, as has been mentioned, people lost their lives in the Scottish reformation, too, and there were martyrs on both sides. However, that does not make it wrong for us to remember or to consider the motivations for the reform at the time.</p><p>I am sure that other members will talk about the profound effect of the reformation on Scotland's spiritual life, its democratic instincts and its extraordinary literacy rate&#8212;which, as others have mentioned, was at 75 per cent by 1750&#8212;and the impact that all that had on a generation of thinkers from Robert Burns to David Hume. However, it is worth saying how completely different the reformation was in Scotland from the story in Ireland or England. In Scotland, one religious group was not planted in the midst of another by Government policy and nor did the monarch take over the church. In Scotland, arguably, the church was taken over by the laity and then the church took over the state, for good or ill.</p><p>We should certainly not mark all that in the bombastic way that I suspect we did on the 350th or 300th anniversaries, but we should pause and think. If we do not mark the reformation for what it was, others will mark it for what they would like it to have been. If I may, let me reassure Mr McMahon, who made a very considered speech, that as far as I am concerned marking the reformation is certainly not the same as celebrating the battle of the Boyne.</p><p>In few parts of Scotland do people hold such profound yet varied Christian beliefs as in the Western Isles, which I represent. In Barra, Vatersay, Eriskay and South Uist, it would be fair to say that, compared with in the rest of Scotland, the reformation hardly happened at all. Benbecula is mixed in religious tradition, whereas North Uist, Harris and Lewis underwent not one but, arguably, several reformations.</p><p>Recently, I visited a constituent in Benbecula whom I know to be a devout Catholic, as evinced by a portrait of the Pope on his kitchen wall. On the same wall, there is also a Rangers calendar. That may surprise colleagues from some other parts of Scotland, but happy religious co-existence of that kind is not, or should not be, such a big deal&#8212;and not just in the Western Isles. I come originally from the Borders. It never even crossed my mind that there was anything unusual about my grandfather being both a kirk elder and a lifelong Celtic fan. In fact, such things&#8212;or their <place-holder colnum=\"25459\"/> equivalents&#8212;can, and regularly do, happen across Europe.</p><p>I mention all that because it is only possible to explain to an outsider why people from different religious traditions on the whole get along very well in the Western Isles if they are first led through 450 years of religious history. It will probably be possible to sort out situations in Scotland in which people do not get on only if we likewise untangle misconceptions on both sides about the past 450 years.</p><p>With that in mind, it is right that the Parliament marks this important anniversary.

Much more important, I am pleased that we have something so substantial to debate today: this new plan of B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig.</p><p>Because there have already been a lot of plans for Gaelic, it is easy to ask what is so different about this one. But there is something different about it. I am pleased to say that the steps in the plan are clear and practical. They start with this <place-holder colnum=\"25406\"/> principle: we do not have all day; this may be our last chance.</p><p>It is now much clearer where B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig is going, because it has a much stronger aim. From here on in, before the board starts any project, it will ask how the project will maintain the number of people who speak Gaelic in Scotland. Ted Brocklebank is right to say that we need to learn from the Maori example. If Jim Mather were leading B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig, I am sure that he would use the word \"alignment\" for this sort of philosophy.</p><p>It will be interesting to follow how the plan will develop and grow. However, a few particular points leap off the page. For example, the plan gives a lot of support to parents who are thinking about Gaelic-medium education for their children. Why is that sort of encouragement still required? It is required because, as long as schools still talk about Gaelic-medium education as being different from mainstream education, some parents will still be frightened about the unusualness of Gaelic education. Gaelic is not the default choice, so people must act as advocates for it. That is the function of the national initiative in the plan.</p><p>It is also important that the board wants to speak to families as soon as a child is born to explain what sort of Gaelic education opportunities are available. It often surprises people when they hear that, in the Western Isles, only one pupil in four goes through Gaelic-medium education. It is interesting that, as the plan recognises, the old hang-ups around the language still act as a stumbling block for many parents. It is also interesting that the board believes that a new legal right to education in the medium of Gaelic, where reasonable demand exists, would overcome at least some of those negative opinions.</p><p>For adults who are trying to learn Gaelic, the plan is encouraging as well. I will say this honestly: it was not easy for me to learn Gaelic, and I am still learning. I do not mean to worry anyone who is learning Gaelic at the moment&#8212;I do not mean to suggest that Gaelic is a complicated language, even though there are no words for \"yes\" or \"no\", nothing is plural unless there are three or more things, the word for a woman is masculine and the word for a beard is feminine. I simply mean that there is no easy opportunity to use the language when one starts to learn it, even in the Gaelic heartland. That is partly because many Gaelic speakers do not understand when someone who is learning Gaelic but is not already fluent asks them to speak Gaelic to them&#8212;everyone is too polite to do so. Many learners in that situation will welcome the support in the plan for open courses and the like. I visited one such course in Stornoway a while ago, and was interested to see how naturally people were learning, without a word <place-holder colnum=\"25407\"/> of grammar or English being used. The plan wants 2,000 people to be on such courses within two years.</p><p>The plan is strong on education in a wider sense. Again, there is a specific aim to increase the number of children going to Gaelic-medium early years education by 20 per cent within two years, and for the number of children going into Gaelic units to increase by 15 per cent at the same time.</p><p>The plan is willing to consider new ways of working, such as the example of attracting teachers from Ireland. The plan tries to ensure that children remain fluent when they leave primary school and ensure that they understand that Gaelic is not to be used only when they are in school.</p><p>Without a doubt, a start has been made. I believe that B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig is in a much stronger and healthier state than previously to tackle the work that is ahead of it.</p><p>I give a warm welcome to the plan, and support the motion in the name of the minister.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763495", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic (Action Plan)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tha mi toilichte gu bheil cothrom eile againn an-diugh a bhith a' bruidhinn anns a' Gh\u00e0idhlig anns an t-se\u00f2mar, ge bith d\u00e8 tha an Daily Mail a' smaoineachadh mu dheidhinn sin.

It supports about 350 full-time-equivalent jobs on dozens of farm sites in the islands, and the industry has an annual production income of around &#163;60 million.</p><p>As other members have mentioned, Scotland accounts for 90 per cent of the United Kingdom's farmed fish&#8212;to which figure the Western Isles makes a significant contribution&#8212;and is one of the largest producers of farmed salmon in the world. Most of the fish farms in the Western Isles that contribute so valuably to the local economy are involved in farming salmon, although there are also cockle, mussel and scallop farms. Vital as fish farming jobs are to coastal communities such as my own, the real prize in additional employment comes with the related processing work.</p><p>I am sorry to say that, for the moment, the number of farmed fish processing jobs in the Western Isles has declined with the closure of the Lighthouse Caledonia Ltd factory at Marybank in Lewis a year ago. I will not lightly forget the unhappy experience of meeting the workforce <place-holder colnum=\"24399\"/> there on the days when activity in the plant was grinding to a halt.</p><p>With the loss of well over a hundred jobs directly and many more indirectly, the closure was a huge blow for a small island economy, but there are now hopes once more that the Western Isles will in the near future reap at least some of the employment potential from fish farming. There are increasingly hopeful signs of the creation of a new Lighthouse Caledonia fish processing factory at Arnish in Lewis, as well as for major fish farming programmes by other companies in Barra. There is little doubt that those schemes have the potential to be of significant economic importance to the Western Isles. I am sure that other members will make similar points about their constituencies.</p><p>Salmon farming represents 95 per cent of the Scottish aquaculture industry. Exports have increased enormously in the past 20 years and the sector is now worth &#163;200 million to the Scottish economy. Many people in remote areas such as the one that I represent rely on the industry and, according to a Scottish Government multiplier, their wages represent a value of around &#163;165 million to the Scottish economy, and more income is retained in the economy by fish farming than is retained by the majority of other sectors in the Scottish economy, perhaps because of the remote location of much of the employment. However, it is perhaps globally that the figures are most daunting. Around the world, fish farming accounts for half of people's seafood consumption&#8212;a huge increase from only 9 per cent in 1980.</p><p>Impressive as those statistics are, there is a recognition on the part of all stakeholders that growth must be sustainable, to use an overused phrase.</p><p>One of the previous Administration's last acts, which received unanimous support in Parliament, was the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act 2007. It sought to ensure that the development of aquaculture took place in the context of increased inspection and enforcement in order to ensure that adequate measures are in place to deal with problems including parasites. The Scottish Government is now seeking to build on that act by developing its principles further through the proposals in \"A Fresh Start: The renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture\". The themes that were identified by respondents during the consultation on the document were not surprising: sea lice, escapes and licensing. What is perhaps new is the willingness to tackle issues in respect of the planning system. As has been publicised in the past few days, the Scottish Government wants to reform the planning system in aquaculture to allow for a much more <place-holder colnum=\"24400\"/> streamlined aquaculture planning process and to attract further investment by improving on decision making.</p><p>Undoubtedly there is a growing global demand for what Scottish aquaculture produces. There is also recognition that in the face of significant competition from other countries, Scottish farmed salmon must continue to trade on its justified image of good quality and environmental standards. The proposed changes to the planning system should be seen in that light: they will make much clearer what is required by way of information to support a planning application.</p><p>After some debate on this point, the Parliament recently passed the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, which makes it clear that planning matters in this area should be in the hands of local authorities. I hope that we will also now have a planning system that is more streamlined and which achieves a more transparent relationship between the role of public bodies that make recommendations and the interests of the public. The Government's approach on that has received broad backing from the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation and the Association of Scottish Shellfish Growers. I believe that what is being put forward is a reasoned set of proposals that will ensure a long-term future for the industry. The measures will secure for aquaculture more protection against disease and parasites. Equally important is that the measures acknowledge the needs of the wider environment to be protected from escapes and pollution. The willingness of all who are involved to engage in reconciling those objectives and to come forward with plans that make sense for this vitally important sector of my local economy, and the economy of Scotland, is to be welcomed warmly.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20679574", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aquaculture"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Others have rightly said how important an industry aquaculture is to Scotland as a whole, but I had not considered how important it is to shinty, too.

As members have said, the CAP comprises 41 per cent of Europe's budget, so it is obvious that it cannot be immune to change and scrutiny. Brian Pack's report is therefore an extremely welcome contribution to the debate about how to direct and cope with changes in the years to come.</p><p>As Brian Pack does, I make the case unashamedly that we must in the future continue to offer some sort of European assistance to <place-holder colnum=\"24082\"/> agriculture. A host of reasons, which members have mentioned, can reasonably be given for such investment. The environmental and social reasons in Scotland include the need to avoid land abandonment, the need to develop our agriculture to cope with our own food needs, and the need to cut down on our food miles. If, for instance, the landscape of my constituency had not been grazed, it would have been almost entirely abandoned many decades ago, not just by its native bird species, but by its human population.</p><p>It is not fashionable to make the case for subsidies: perhaps the harshest criticism of agricultural subsidies has come from international aid agencies, which point to the advantage that the CAP arguably gives to some wealthy European farmers over small farmers in developing nations. However, there is probably more common ground to be found on that than is thought, at least if we take the perspective of Scotland's hill farmers and crofters, to whom the imbalance in how European moneys are distributed remains a source of continuing unhappiness. I do not wish to enter a dispute with Scotland's wealthier arable landowners, but it must be said that crofters and hill farmers look with surprise at the levels of support that a relatively small number of Scotland's farmers receive under the system that Europe operates.</p><p>For that reason, I will concentrate on elements of the Pack inquiry interim report that consider less favoured area status. As members would expect, the recommendations relating to that most interest my constituents. I urge all crofters and farmers in the Highlands and Islands to engage in the consultation on the report before the closing date. One instance of the unease that hill farmers and crofters feel about the present system is understood when we look at the map of less favoured areas in Scotland. On one level, we should be pleased by the recognition of Scotland's terrain. Apart from one or two small pockets, the only land that is not under less favoured area status is a relatively thin coastal strip from the Black Isle to Berwickshire. The remaining bulk of Scotland's land is classed as less favoured, with virtually all of it earning the severely disadvantaged, rather than the disadvantaged, classification.</p><p>As ever, I appreciate the risks of special pleading and I understand that there is a limit to the number of classifications that we can have, but it strikes me that the agricultural disadvantages that are faced in places such as Wester Ross or Harris are of an entirely different magnitude from those that are faced in West Lothian or East Ayrshire, but all those places currently have the same classification. I say that not to diminish the needs of agriculture in lowland Scotland, but to point to the dramatically different travel costs, <place-holder colnum=\"24083\"/> distances to markets and fuel prices, and the sheer physical difficulty of the landscape in many remoter parts of the country. I believe that those issues will emerge in the consultation. I believe also that Pack's analysis of the situation is fair.</p><p>The system of historic payments, through which, as others have said, payments are in some cases based on what land was used for 10 years ago, will not be tolerated for much longer. Agriculture that, shall we say, reaps where it does not sow will not enjoy public support. I welcome the Scottish Government's evident determination to fight Scotland's corner in Europe to ensure that the future shape of the single farm payment reflects Scotland's needs. I am happy that the Government recognises the importance of the relationship between the single farm payment and the LFASS.</p><p>Farmers and crofters in Scotland are conscious of the risks that are posed by the likely decline of the single farm payment budget after 2013. There is a growing understanding that historic payments will not be around for ever. The options that are set out in Brian Pack's interim report are not without controversy. They are based on a four-strand option: area-based direct payments, a top-up fund, SRDP funding and less favoured area funding in some shape or form. The interim report's suggestions on how a top-up fund could be spent will doubtless attract debate.

Doubtless, some people will see special pleading at work in this debate, but I do not. I should declare an interest as someone whose decrepit car presently sits for three days a week rusting further outside Stornoway airport, but the issue is particularly significant to island communities, therefore I welcome the opportunity to discuss it.</p><p>As Liam McArthur said, a number of factors make the island airports different. First, they are not primarily used by tourists. Yes, some islanders leave their cars at the airport when they are on holiday, but my understanding is that the overwhelming majority of people who leave their cars at Stornoway airport do so because they have to travel off island with work or, in a large number of cases, they are going to hospital or visiting someone in hospital.<place-holder colnum=\"23952\"/></p><p>As the airports provide lifeline services that are essential for the islands to function as modern economies, another special factor is worth bearing in mind: the money that many islanders have to pay to get to the mainland unless they book many weeks in advance is the kind of money with which one could have a foreign holiday. For that reason, the threat to introduce car parking charges at island airports has a knock-on effect on economic development in the islands.</p><p>I recognise the harsh realities under which HIAL operates and the constraints that are upon it, like the rest of the country. I also recognise its willingness to consider, in many cases, the option of paying for better bus services to its airports to connect with flights. However, I would be lying if I said that a bus between Stornoway and Stornoway airport would be likely to tempt me out of my car unless it could be shown that there was a convincing way of getting the 8 miles from my house to Stornoway by public transport in time to connect with that bus.</p><p>I live relatively close to an airport, but the situation for many other islanders&#8212;who live further afield and have two or three buses a day to choose from&#8212;is unpromising. Alternatively, if the proposal is that I should drive to town and then get the bus from town to the airport, I hope that a new park and ride-sized car park is being built somewhere in Stornoway to facilitate that.</p><p>Those are the realities of transport in all island communities. For all those reasons, although I recognise the difficulties that HIAL faces, I share Liam McArthur's hope that consultation on the matter will be genuine and far reaching and that the issues that I and others have mentioned will be to the fore in HIAL's mind. I hope that the daily challenges that islanders face&#8212;whether they be in Orkney, Shetland or the Western Isles&#8212;are acknowledged.

It is interesting to see the growth in loyalty of BBC Alba viewers. Children are now accustomed to the view that it is normal to hear cartoons in Gaelic, and people who are without a word of Gaelic are getting accustomed to the view that it is normal to see football or nature programmes about Africa or other areas in Gaelic. If there is anything that we in the Gaelic world want, it is normalisation of that kind. Any language without television is unusual. Youths have no interest in an unusual language, no matter how interesting it may be to anthropologists.<place-holder colnum=\"23765\"/></p><p>Sixty years ago, some people in Israel said that the language of scripture was too sacred to be used for cookery programmes on the radio and the like. We have travelled down a long road since the days when people used to write to the newspapers to complain that, although wonderfully good Gaelic could be heard at the Mod, it was not suitable for use in cookery programmes. In order to prove that point, BBC Alba will speak to me next month about my favourite recipes. Members should look out for fish fingers and Creamola Foam.</p><p>As Ted Brocklebank said, BBC Alba appreciates that it is vital for it to broadcast every kind of programme and for its programmes to be attractive to all viewers. However, its work would be much easier if it could be seen on Freeview. I am not saying that simply because I could not access BBC Alba in Lewis for six months. I was waiting for a Sky dish; several others were also waiting. I am not even complaining because I cannot access the channel in Parliament, which uses cable television, to which Pauline McNeill referred. If BBC Alba could be viewed at no cost with other Freeview channels, that would give tremendous encouragement to broadcasting through the medium of Gaelic. If that were the case, there would be more homes in which people could listen to, learn and become familiar with Gaelic, and the BBC trust would get a bit of peace.</p><p>Is it not strange that Westminster still has control of Gaelic broadcasting? However, that situation remains.</p><p>Already, 220,000 people watch BBC Alba every week, but how many more could watch it if it were available on Freeview? If the trust plans to remove radio channels from Freeview in order to make space for BBC Alba, I hope that it will explain why and that it will not let a needless fight about the issue arise in the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p><p>I understand the point that Iain Smith made, but it is important to explain that those channels will still be available online and on the radio.

That makes the commitments on local government in Mr Swinney's budget all the more significant. Despite Mr Swinney having significantly less money at his disposal this year than was originally intimated by the London Government, and despite undertaking to protect the health budget, the Scottish Government has devoted a greater share of its resources to local government than was allocated last year.</p><p>As we heard, the previous Executive cut the share of the budget that went to councils year on year, whereas the Scottish Government has increased the share every year. As others have pointed out, the allocation for local government for 2008 to 2011 is 12.9 per cent up on that for 2005 to 2008. However, perhaps a more significant point than all those figures is the fact that the Government has brought to an end a generation of micromanagement of council finances. Ring fencing in its old form is passing into history. When even Mr McMahon acknowledges in <em>Holyrood Magazine</em> that Labour has</p><p class=\"indent\">\"lost the argument on ring fencing\",</p><p>we know that it has finally been accepted that a healthier balance of power must exist&#8212;and does now exist&#8212;between Scotland's local and national Government.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee, on which I serve, acknowledged that fact in its report on local government finance. As is right, the report makes no attempt to minimise the serious strains under which local government, like national Government, in Scotland finds itself or the difficult choices that councils will face in determining what they can do over and above their statutory duties in the lean budget settlement years that lie ahead for Scotland.</p><p>The report, which followed an inquiry that took evidence from councils throughout Scotland, calls for a fundamental review of the expectations of local government. It calls for local government to be ambitious in spite of the pressures and talks about benchmarking rather than just achieving minimum standards. It also examines the issues around the sharing of services. The obvious way to share services in remote and rural parts of Scotland such as my constituency is surely not for councils to get bigger, but to share some of the <place-holder colnum=\"23686\"/> parallel bureaucracies that exist with, perhaps, health boards in the same small place.</p><p>The order, like the committee report, acknowledges that councils deserve support.

It prevents people from working from home or pretty much anywhere else in the community, it impedes business start-up and survival, and it prevents schools from accessing the benefits of large areas of the curriculum as it is delivered elsewhere.</p><p>Without overly rehearsing the history of the situation, I believe that there is no doubt that a serious error was made some years ago when just over 20 areas in my constituency were left without exchanges that were capable of delivering broadband. The previous Scottish Executive tried, and the current Scottish Government is trying, to address that injustice through the provision of wireless broadband, delivered by connected communities. I understand that the previous Executive pursued the wireless option because even if the exchanges had been upgraded, a substantial number of people would still have been unable to access broadband because their homes are too far from the exchange for the technology to work. Let there be no doubt that in some parts of the Western Isles a wireless or satellite solution <place-holder colnum=\"23438\"/> will remain the only feasible option, but a much smaller minority of households would have had to rely on those options if fairness had been exercised when exchanges were enabled elsewhere.</p><p>Mr Peacock's motion implies the frailties of connected communities, some of which are borne out in my mailbag as the local MSP. However, judging from the evidence of my mailbag, I venture that the picture is a little more complex than it might at first appear. First, the complaints that I get about broadband come from at least three distinct groups. The first group is people who are impatient for connected communities&#8212;the wireless option&#8212;to put up masts in their community. Some people may hate wireless broadband but, in the interests of a complete picture, I should say that I have also been grilled by a hall full of people in Harris imploring me to get connected communities to come to their part of the islands immediately.</p><p>The second group is people who want improvements to connected communities' service, whether by making it more reliable or cheaper, or by ensuring that someone is on the end of the phone to fix things when they go wrong.</p><p>The third group is people who are calling for a boycott of connected communities and, by implication, a boycott of broadband altogether until exchanges are upgraded. That is the smallest group. However, let there be no doubt that a serious mistake was made when the exchanges were not upgraded.</p><p>I agree that there are many potentially positive aspects in the \"Digital Britain\" report. I merely say that, if Lord Carter's review rights the wrongs that exist, it will find a welcome in the Highlands and Islands, but if, to meet the universal broadband obligation, it seeks to impose a levy on the very households that do not enjoy such an entitlement, it will struggle to be taken to people's hearts.</p><p>I thank Mr Peacock for bringing the debate to Parliament and for highlighting an issue that is of concern to my constituents.</p>", "hdate": "2010-02-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20544553", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Broadband Availability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Peter Peacock for securing this members' business debate on what is an important issue, not least, as he mentioned, for my constituency.

In my constituency, 2,623 prescription prepayment certificates were purchased in 2008-09. Given the small population, that is a huge number of people who still have to pay for essential medication. Perhaps the Conservatives would like to explain their position to those people directly. One has to wonder whether the Tories are planning to campaign up and down the land for their constituents' right to pay for prescriptions.</p><p>As the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing has indicated, around 600,000 adults who live in families with an annual income of less than &#163;16,000 will benefit from the abolition of prescription charges. The Minister for Public Health and Sport provided that figure in response to a written question from Johann Lamont on 28 October 2008. By no stretch of the imagination are those 600,000 families well off. Overwhelmingly, they are ordinary Scots who are working to earn a living. If there is any suggestion&#8212;and there is&#8212;that some families in that situation are deterred from buying what their doctor has prescribed for them, how can we say that we are serious about improving Scotland's health?

In fact, we still have more doctors, nurses and other health professionals working in Scotland than ever before. All that is at a time when the Scottish budget is under more pressure than ever before from unprecedented budget cuts from the London Government.</p><p>The Scottish Government has committed to protecting NHS budgets, even under that strain. Meanwhile, the Scottish Tories dropped a hint to the Scottish Government last week to prepare a stand-by budget</p><p class=\"indent\">\"in case they have to make further cuts after the election.\"</p><p>The Conservative party says that it wants to look at saving money to be reinvested in front-line services, which might well be a laudable aim. If that is the case, rather than cutting a measure that is aimed at helping everyone in society, including those who need help most, it should look at some of its own UK fiscal policies, which, in true Tory style, are aimed solely at helping the very wealthiest in society. Such policies include increasing the threshold of inheritance tax, which it is estimated would cost &#163;1.5 billion, and abolishing the top rate of income tax for all those who earn more than &#163;150,000.</p><p>While Labour and the Conservatives vie with each other about who can cut most from Scotland's budget, Scotland's Government will get on with the task of making health care free at the point of need. As long as the Conservatives in Scotland argue against free prescriptions, they will struggle to be taken into the hearts of the people of Scotland.

The Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill forms at least part of that response.</p><p>The two parts of the bill deal with distinct issues. However, in its report, the Local Government and Communities Committee endorsed the general principles of both part 1 and part 2. Essentially, those principles are to strengthen the existing provision in Scots law to protect home owners and to build on the experience of how the Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Act 2001 has worked in practice.</p><p>The need for action is clear. Citizens Advice Scotland is one of many organisations that strongly support the bill. It was represented on the debt action forum and is only too aware of what debt means for families around Scotland. One <place-holder colnum=\"22380\"/> theme of evidence was the need to obtain reliable Scottish figures for repossession. I understand that the Scottish Government has been in dialogue with the Financial Services Authority about requiring lenders to provide separate Scottish data in order better to inform policy making in the distinct Scottish housing market. The issue is highlighted in the Local Government and Communities Committee's report. However, the figures at UK level present a concerning picture, with 53,000 repossessions forecast for 2010 and repossession orders granted by courts at their highest for at least a decade. In the present climate, none of that comes as any great surprise.</p><p>The Scottish Government has responded to the need in ways other than legislation. In January 2008, an additional &#163;35 million was provided to the home owners support fund to help with mortgage to rent and the new mortgage to shared equity scheme, which was launched in March that year. Between January and August 2009, almost 150 families benefited from the scheme. The Government has also increased funding for debt advice, with an additional &#163;1 million for Citizens Advice Scotland in 2009-10 and a further &#163;250,000 to support accreditation towards the national standards for information and advice. Funding for relevant legal advice has increased by &#163;3 million over two years.</p><p>However, there was a widely shared feeling that further action at legislative level was necessary as a matter of urgency. That urgency necessitated a reasonable attitude towards the length of the consultation period for the bill, but interested parties were engaged extensively. As other members have mentioned, initially there were calls from some quarters for emergency legislation, which would have restricted engagement severely. That route was rejected.</p><p>Part 1 makes extensive changes to the extent to which home owners and other residents can apply to court to delay repossession under the 2001 act. That facility has been extended to include almost all instances in which a lender seeks to repossess a property as a result of debts or mortgage arrears. Crucially, a lender will no longer be able to sell a domestic home that is used as a security without recourse to court action. Lenders will have to show that they have considered reasonable alternatives to repossession. The bill codifies industry best practice guidance and goes further than the England and Wales pre-action protocol in the area&#8212;with good reason, as others have observed.</p><p>It is worth clarifying one issue that was raised in evidence&#8212;the protection of the family home in the process. The bill does not provide absolute protection of the family home from bankruptcy or repossession. The fear that it would do that lay <place-holder colnum=\"22381\"/> behind some, although not all, of the criticisms that were made of the bill in committee.</p><p>As others have mentioned, part 2 deals with issues relating to bankruptcy and trust deeds, removing the requirement for the creditor to give consent before a person enters bankruptcy by creating an alternative route that involves their being assessed by an authorised person, such as a solicitor, as being unable to pay debts.</p><p>Much of the evidence on part 2 was, declaredly, from people who make a living&#8212;in some cases, a substantial living&#8212;from the existing system. That notwithstanding, it would be fair to reflect a variety of views among the committee on part 2.</p><p>The issue around the Accountant in Bankruptcy automatically becoming the trustee in certificate for sequestration cases caused continuing debate in the committee. Some of the other concerns that were raised by insolvency practitioners about part 2 were not shared by organisations such as Shelter, which believed that the provisions help people who currently do not have debt solutions available to them. In any event, evidence from ministers indicated their willingness to consider amending the bill at stage 2 if outstanding areas of concern remain. Discussions between ministers and stakeholders continue.</p><p>Despite there being various areas, particularly in part 2, in which the committee identified a need for further parliamentary scrutiny and debate, the committee was able to endorse the general principles of the bill.

The Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill is crucial to offering a greater degree of protection to all school communities, but I believe that it is particularly relevant to remote and rural constituencies such as mine, where schools are often&#8212;to use an overused but underappreciated phrase&#8212;the focal point of the community. Indeed, rural schools are integral to the sustainability of many remote regions.</p><p>It is clear that the main purpose of the bill is to revise and strengthen the statutory consultation process that is required when education authorities consider changes to the school estate, particularly school closures. I want to focus on rural schools not to belittle the importance of schools in urban areas&#8212;that importance is recognised in the bill&#8212;but because a crucial distinction must be understood. A school closure in an urban community is damaging&#8212;we have seen that in Glasgow and other places&#8212;but a <place-holder colnum=\"21424\"/> school closure in a rural area can effectively close down an entire community economically. Rural school closures can render huge tracts of Scotland out of bounds, in effect, for young families, which can result in huge economic and social impacts, as well as educational impacts.</p><p>There are around 1,000 schools in rural areas, which includes 41 per cent of Scottish primary schools and 23 per cent of Scottish secondary schools. The number includes 39 schools in my constituency, the smallest of which has a roll of eight. However, there are 552 fewer schools in Scotland than there were four decades ago. Since I was in primary 1&#8212;I hasten to add that that was not quite four decades ago&#8212;the total number of publicly funded schools in Scotland has dropped by nearly 17 per cent, and there are 357 fewer primary schools. My school was among the casualties. It is undeniable that that decline is partly due to falling school rolls, but the trend has often been so steep because local councils have had to do relatively little to shut down local schools when they have decided that they want to do so.</p><p>The bill aims to redress the balance. It sets out a much more vigorous set of procedures for consultations on school closures, which local authorities must adhere to. The intention is to establish, in effect, a presumption against the closure of schools unless certain prescribed factors have been taken into account. That will help to safeguard in particular rural schools in my constituency and schools like them, which can be fundamental to safeguarding small and fragile local economies.</p><p>The bill does not say that no school should ever close&#8212;members have made that point&#8212;but it means that local authorities will have to publish and advertise clear educational benefits statements that set out why a school closure might be justified on educational grounds specifically. Parents, teachers and pupils are among the mandatory consultees in the process. In addition, rural school closure will not take place without the council examining alternatives to closure.</p><p>I am delighted that the Scottish Government is determined to ensure that rural communities on the islands and elsewhere are much more meaningfully listened to when school closures are proposed. Specifically, local authorities will have to take into account the impact that any school closure would have on the rural community concerned.</p><p>The bill has been improved as it has gone through the parliamentary process, specifically at stage 2. For example, amendments have introduced community councils as statutory consultees. Following amendments that I lodged, the bill will require local authorities to take into account and to consult on the impact that any <place-holder colnum=\"21425\"/> school closure would have on Gaelic language provision in the local community where that is relevant. Gaelic education is growing, but it could fall victim to school closures if it is not one of the factors that are taken into account when decisions are being made on school closure proposals.</p><p>I went to a one-teacher school and I am only too aware that closing a school can take the heart out of a community. We should be clear that there will always be circumstances in which schools have to close, but we should seek to make rural and remote communities more, not less, attractive to young families. The bill will go a long way towards ensuring that that is the case.</p><p>The bill has achieved broad support from local authorities, parent councils and community councils.

Once in a while we get a reality check, as I am pleased to say that I did recently, when I spent a day lifting creels with the crew of the fishing vessel Wakeful, from the isle of Grimsay. Let me confirm, with some respect in my voice, that nobody does a day's work quite like fishermen.</p><p>Between now and December, the Scottish Government also faces a daunting task: negotiating with Europe over the proposed cuts in total allowable catches recommended by European scientists. The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This year has been a tough one for many fishermen, with the recession and low fish prices combined with existing restrictions imposed on our fleets ... Crazy EU rules mean that our fishermen have little choice but to throw away much of the fish they catch.\"</p><p>Scotland, which has one fifth of the European Union's seas, is responsible for some of Europe's richest fishing. The fact that Scottish landings are worth almost &#163;400 million to the economy is important, not least in my constituency. In the Western Isles, the fishing industry provides much of the population with a source of income and, in one shape or another, supports more than 800 jobs. In 2008, 3,800 tonnes of seafood, valued at &#163;11.3 million, was landed in the outer Hebrides, 90 per cent of which was shellfish. All that points to the unavoidable conclusion that the fishing <place-holder colnum=\"20979\"/> industry deserves to be protected from the most insane excesses of the European common fisheries policy. I am heartened to hear that the cabinet secretary is going about the negotiations in exactly that spirit and that he is seeking to mitigate what European officials are proposing.</p><p>The proposals on nephrops concern me most. European Commission scientists have recommended that the total allowable catch for prawns be cut by 15 per cent. That would represent a significant cut in both the prospective catch and in income for fishermen in my constituency at an economically tough time when they are struggling to make ends meet, particularly given that overheads are being driven up by continuing high fuel prices.</p><p>John Hermse, secretary of the Mallaig and North West Fishermen's Association, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The system as it is now really is a lot of nonsense and it's been like this for a number of years ... the way it is now is absolute madness.\"</p><p>Instead of taking the drastic measures of quota cuts, at least in the form proposed by the European Commission, the Scottish Government is endeavouring to ensure that a more sensible way forward is found. I hope that that means that in future we might perhaps catch fewer fish but land more of what we catch. That would help to ensure the long-term future of our valuable fish stocks and cut dramatically the number of fish that are discarded, which would allow the fish populations to regenerate and become more sustainable.</p><p>The main goal of the European Commission's fishing policy&#8212;or, at least, its stated aim&#8212;is to create and maintain sustainable fish populations. However, Scotland has already played a leading role in meeting those objectives through good management of sustainable fishing.</p><p>We now have the opportunity to make up for previous inactivity on this front. Throughout these years&#8212;certainly the past eight years&#8212;there has been little discernible effort to maintain or protect the fishing industry in Scotland from European policies or to find a sustainable future for our seas on the basis of meaningful science, as opposed to the basest of European political considerations.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20354499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fisheries Negotiations"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is that time of year again.

Scotland rightly prides itself on the institutions of its distinctive justice system&#8212;institutions that remarkably survived the long adjournment of this Parliament&#8212;but there is wide and, as is obvious, cross-party acknowledgement that those institutions are now creaking under the weight of their work and are in need of serious reform. That is clearly Lord Gill's view.</p><p>I will not perjure myself by claiming to have read all 700 pages of the report. Even the executive summary runs to more than 35 pages, which stretches the shameful attention span of most politicians. It is clear that his recommendations form a comprehensive whole and, rather than cherry pick from the report now, we should consider it as a whole before we go any further.</p><p>I thank Lord Gill and his team for dedicating two and a half years to the project and for producing a report that will, I hope, be used to effect the changes that need to be made in our civil justice system. The report covers the cost of litigation, the role of mediation, the development of modern methods of communication and the proposed specialisation of courts. Paul McBride QC&#8212;not someone whom I often find myself quoting&#8212;was reported in <em>The Scotsman </em>as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There is no downside to Lord Gill's report. The idea is it will improve access to justice for civil litigants and save them a great deal of money and time. ... Lord Gill is doing something that is long overdue.\"</p><p>The need for such reform is brought home to me as a layman by one simple fact that sheds light on the ridiculous nature of the present situation: in more than half of cases before the Court of Session, it costs more to sue than the sum that is being sued for. That fact, taken together with the long delays that arise from the pressures of criminal business, leads in Lord Gill's view to a need for greater judicial specialisation. In his view, judicial resources are being used inefficiently and there is an over-reliance on temporary judicial resources. He states that there is a need for effective case management, reformed procedures and investment in information technology. He also identifies a problem with the current costs and funding for litigation.</p><p>If one thing in Lord Gill's report is perhaps worth concentrating on as a potential remedy to some of the problems, it is his proposal for the new office of district judge. The proposal merits considerable parliamentary time for consideration, but it is an attractive idea that a district judge might sit in the sheriff court to hear criminal cases and civil cases that have a value of less than &#163;5,000. Those courts should have, in the report's words,<place-holder colnum=\"20473\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"a problem solving or interventionist approach in which the court should identify the issues and specify what it wishes to see or hear by way of evidence or argument\",</p><p>with&#8212;significantly&#8212;rules that are</p><p class=\"indent\">\"drafted for party litigants rather than practitioners.\"</p><p>If the court agreed, litigants could be represented by suitable lay representatives. Those proposals would significantly reduce the complexity and expense for litigants and reduce the pressure on sheriffs.</p><p>The Scottish Government has shown some commitment to reform in those areas through reform of the summary criminal justice system and the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008, which has given the courts modern governance arrangements for the first time. The Government has also introduced an Arbitration (Scotland) Bill to strengthen the protection of home owners, and will soon implement the EU directive on mediation.</p><p>Lord Gill has made some proposals that the Parliament needs to take seriously, particularly his thoughts on district judges, a new civil justice council, a major shift in judicial procedure and the creation of a non-geographical personal injury court based in Edinburgh. If we are to improve our justice system and implement any of the changes that he recommends, the report should be carefully considered in Parliament and through public scrutiny and evaluated further to determine which measures might be adopted.</p><p>The proposed changes are major reforms that will take time to put into action. Although it might be a slow and painful process&#8212;especially given the present need for reduced public spending&#8212;the end result will help to create a civil justice system that is less costly in time and money to those who utilise it.</p><p>Before we get ahead of ourselves, the intention behind the motion, as I read it, is that we produce proposals that will be subject to detailed public consultation. After that process, we can proceed with restructuring our civil justice system, as determined by the public and Parliament.</p><p>Having sounded that cautionary note, I say that we would, as a Parliament, do well to heed Lord Gill's call for radicalism and his acceptance of the need for radical change that, as he concludes, remains true to the values and distinctiveness of Scots law and our separate legal system. I believe that that might well be achieved by, among many other measures, removing the role of the UK Supreme Court from the civil appeals process in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20207535", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Civil Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The Scottish Government has already started to improve our civil justice system.

As the convener of the Local Government and Communities Committee did, I thank everyone who gave evidence to the committee during its inquiry. I also thank the committee members for their contribution, the committee clerks for all their hard work and the staff of SPICe for their dedication and invaluable assistance.<place-holder colnum=\"20190\"/></p><p>The committee wants its report to help to find resolutions to the many outstanding equal pay cases in Scottish local government. As members have observed, the inquiry was the third time that a parliamentary committee had considered the issue. The committee wants to ensure that no further inquiries into the issue are needed. A fairer distribution of wealth is key to economic growth and equal pay is an important part of that. As many members have said, equal pay in local authorities is an historical issue going back many years. Although it continues to pose a challenge for councils, it must be resolved without further undue delay. I hope that the report will help in that process. It suggests solutions to several of the issues.</p><p>The committee received evidence from all the main stakeholders in local government pay and rights issues&#8212;local authorities, COSLA, trade unions and lawyers. Unfortunately, it was clear that trust no longer seems to be part of the process. I hope that the committee's recommendations on working together go some way to helping to restore some of that lost trust.</p><p>As members know, the single status agreement between local authorities and unions was made in 1999, to harmonise manual and non-manual workers' terms and conditions. Each local authority had to implement it individually, but to date not all of them have done so. In the intervening period, several legal rulings have impacted on equal pay. Together with the delays, those have led to a large number of individual employees lodging equal pay cases with employment tribunals. The committee did not seek to completely reopen the discussions about the reasons for those lengthy delays, particularly given that the Finance Committee in the second session of Parliament covered that in a report on the same subject. However, about 35,000 equal pay claims have been lodged with employment tribunals, a number that has increased considerably since the Finance Committee published its report.</p><p>I will mention a number of observations that were made to the committee on the situation that local authorities currently face. The first is that it might have been better if equal pay had been implemented nationally rather than leaving it to 32 local authorities. The second is that such a long time has passed that there have been court rulings and changes to the law that have had an impact. The final one is that the issues could have been resolved in what was a time of financial growth.</p><p>The committee made a number of recommendations relevant to that in its report. The first is that the Scottish Government could facilitate further talks between all the relevant parties: local authorities, COSLA, trade unions and lawyers. There are strong cases in the system, in which the <place-holder colnum=\"20191\"/> main issue might not be over whether discrimination has occurred but over the level of compensation; the committee was of the view that those cases should be settled without further delay. Discussions should also focus on whether there could be staged payments to ease the financial burden on local authorities, although it is also worth noting that the Scottish Government is investing record levels of funding in local government.</p><p>Work should now be done to help to prevent more cases from arising in the future, for example by having an independent assessment of local authority pay and grading arrangements and annual equal pay audits in local authorities. The committee has sought clarification from the Scottish Government and others on the timescale for and operation of any scheme to help local authorities to meet their equal pay liabilities. The cabinet secretary has said that he is in negotiation with the Treasury in that regard.</p><p>I will refer to and thank several speakers&#8212;in fact, given my innate politeness, probably all of them. The cabinet secretary recognised the problems and said that borrowing in itself might not be the solution. We await with interest the outcomes of his negotiations with the Treasury.</p><p>David Whitton rightly reminded us of the important principle of equal pay and why it should exercise us in the first place. David McLetchie's forensic skills were not lost on the committee and they came to the fore again today in his reference to the Bainbridge decision and other related implications. In a Freudian slip, he also sought 37 council settlements for the benefit of the people of Edinburgh.</p><p>Jim Tolson spoke about the level of outstanding compensation and the dangers in the current litigious atmosphere. John Wilson referred to the failure to settle early in the process and the consequences of that with which we are now living. Sarah Boyack referred to pay audits and the need to measure the progress of any future solution. Margaret Mitchell highlighted the problems with using taxpayers' money to defend the legal claims of litigants.</p><p>As others have mentioned, Tricia Marwick spoke powerfully first about the problem of justice delayed being justice denied and then about the hazards of certain no-win, no-fee lawyers for people who are often in straitened circumstances. Mary Mulligan reminded us of the need to avoid prevarication on the matter and of the scope for Government and councils to work together. Jeremy Purvis referred to on-going liability and the implications for councils' budgets.</p><p>Michael McMahon cited the outstanding problem of home care workers as a concrete example of <place-holder colnum=\"20192\"/> inequality. Bob Doris mentioned the sheer scale of tribunal claims and the urgency with which local authorities need to deal with them. He also mentioned that COSLA could have dealt with such claims on a national basis.</p><p>Marlyn Glen gave more detail on the capitalisation issue. Alison McInnes summarised much in the report and referred to the need to monitor equality proofing in future. Gavin Brown mentioned the unresolved issues to do with the Scottish Government's potential role as a facilitator. David Whitton wondered what some people in local government do for a living and left each of us to wonder how he might be thinking of. He also said that no-brainer cases need to be dealt with quickly.</p><p>The committee does not want just to publish its report; it wants to speak about equal pay in Parliament and continue to discuss the issue, which it does not consider to be closed. We have come up with potential solutions in our report and we will keep monitoring the progress that we hope will be made towards them.

Any report invites multiple readings, but one point is pretty clear. The report contains evidence that was received about the overall size of Scotland's budget. The much-quoted Stella Manzie, the director general of finance and corporate services in the Scottish Government, stated that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the net result of the 2008 Pre-Budget Report and the 2009 UK Budget is that the Scottish DEL total for 2010-11 is 'reduced below original plans by &#163;496 million'.\"</p><p>Before we go any further, let us put the matter to rest. However it is spun or explained away, Scotland is getting &#163;0.5 billion less than everyone&#8212;Opposition parties included&#8212;expected or was able to plan for. That has consequences for every area of Government plans. Were it not so, why would other parties be telling Scotland to tighten its belt?</p><p>Even for a party that is well used to holding two&#8212;sometimes three&#8212;contradictory positions simultaneously and devoutly, Labour surely stretches credulity in saying that the budget settlement from Westminster is anything other than a cut in what we all expected and planned for. The injunction from Labour for the Scottish Government to live within reduced means also sits ill with any assertion that Scotland is being given a handsome pay rise by Westminster. Then again, it is lacking in credibility for Westminster to tell us that we should tighten our belts while it tells other countries around the world that they cannot cut their way out of a recession. It seems that the belt-tightening advice applies uniquely to Scotland. There is a further inconsistency&#8212;very much in evidence today&#8212;whereby, perhaps increasingly comfortable on the Opposition benches, Labour members provide lists of planned spending projects that they believe that the Scottish Government should undertake while in no way attempting to relate them to the cuts that the Scottish budget faces.</p><p>Nobody denies the severity of the international situation or the difficult choices that all governments face this year. However, in the words of the report, Scotland's block grant may have \"peaked\" as the result of political decisions that have been made elsewhere. As the cabinet <place-holder colnum=\"19547\"/> secretary has just indicated, we can expect a further dip of several billion pounds, in real terms, by 2013. Even before the cut was made, Scotland faced the smallest percentage budget increase in some time. Other members have pointed to that fact. However, when the Scottish Government asks local authorities to make efficiency savings, the councils concerned get to make them. The novel form of efficiency savings that Westminster has introduced in Scotland amounts to a direct cut from our annual budget.</p><p>Putting that debate aside, it is abundantly clear, as is recognised by at least some other parties in this chamber, that part of Scotland's unique predicament is its unique inability to borrow. Scotland, as other speakers have observed, is unable to spread the cost of major capital projects over a period of years because of the restrictions in the Scotland Act 1998.</p><p>Before the usual suspects complain about that statement, I ask them to say which bit of it is not true. As presently constituted, the Parliament has no borrowing powers. In February, in acknowledgment of the situation, the Liberal Democrats lodged a motion that stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament believes that the acquisition of borrowing powers would enhance the autonomy and accountability of the Scottish Parliament and improve the Scottish Government's ability to respond to changing economic circumstances\".</p><p>At present, Northern Ireland has such a power, but Scotland does not. Clackmannanshire has such as power, but Scotland does not. English parish councils have such a power, but Scotland does not. In fact, it is difficult to find an example of a Parliament anywhere in the world that is constrained in this way&#8212;let alone the many other ways in which we are constrained.</p><p>Many bad arguments are offered against Scotland taking more control of our own financial affairs, whether that control means borrowing powers, genuine fiscal autonomy or independence. However, the most craven as well as the most logically inconsistent argument is that now is not the time. If this is not the time for Scotland to acquire such powers, when is? When the UK Government is further in debt? It is already the most indebted state in Europe. When we are on the other side of the recession? At that point, the argument will no doubt be offered that, at a time of economic strength, we should not rock a stable boat. For those who oppose such powers, the time has never been right, and never will be. For the rest of us, the time is now.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20190813", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Question Time &#8212; Scottish Executive &#8212; Finance and Sustainable Growth: \"Strategic Budget Scrutiny\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo other members' thanks to the members and staff of the Finance Committee who have produced such a comprehensive report.

I have the twin advantages not only of representing the Western Isles, but of being&#8212;as a certain Labour <place-holder colnum=\"18632\"/> publication tirelessly reminds my constituents, although apparently without the desired effect&#8212;a borderer. In the Borders, local festivals are both enjoyed and taken very seriously.</p><p>Selkirk common riding is the classic example of a local festival that exists for a reason. It has not been concocted for tourists but is held by and for the benefit of a community that wants to celebrate its identity. Selkirk common riding provokes a powerful response in souters&#8212;the natives of Selkirk, of whom there are three in the Parliament. Like all genuine festivals, it has things about it the reasons for which are lost in the mists of time or which are pleasantly incomprehensible to anyone who might stumble on it. I am thinking of the fact that it begins at 4 am&#8212;or, rather, that it is unclear at what point on the nicht afore the morn it begins&#8212;and the fact that the standard bearer must be unmarried. The sight of the casting of the colours is impressive, as the town eerily remembers its fallen at the battle of Flodden. The fact that any town&#8212;without prompting from historians or politicians&#8212;genuinely seems collectively to recall something that happened in 1513 is profoundly impressive.</p><p>The most impressive festivals in Scotland take place, as in Selkirk, not because someone has decided that there is a benefit to the local tourist economy, however welcome that benefit may be&#8212;I do not detract from the important point that the motion makes about that&#8212;but because people in a community feel that they are important to the community. In many cases, the reasons for the festivals go back so far that no one can remember them and that is what makes them interesting. People in Selkirk ride around the marches of the burgh because they have to&#8212;some neighbouring landlord might pinch a bit of the town if they did not. Likewise, in my constituency, there are a variety of local festivals, the best known of which are connected to the Gaelic musical tradition. Each year, boat-loads of singers take off for the Mod, a test of social as well as musical stamina. I declare an interest as a member of Back district choir. In 2011, the Mod will come home to the Western Isles.</p><p>The Mod is a national rather than local festival, which has done as much as any other event or organisation to maintain the Gaelic language and promote a truly unique musical tradition. However, there are many other local musical festivals, from Ceolas, in South Uist and Eriskay, to the local mods in Lewis and Harris as well as all the informal ceilidhs&#8212;in the original sense of that word&#8212;that still take place around the islands.</p><p>At the risk of missing out many community festivals, I also mention the Grimsay boat festival, the fishermen's mass in Barra, the Vatersay Boys on tour somewhere, Tattoo Hebrides, the MacNeil <place-holder colnum=\"18633\"/> clan gathering, several highland games, Stornoway carnival and the massively popular Hebridean Celtic Festival, which now draws almost 20,000 people in a single week to the Isle of Lewis&#8212;a festival that truly has social, economic and cultural impacts on its community. I might even include the annual guga hunt on Sulasgeir among the islands' annual festivals, albeit a very private one. It is an astonishing, ancient and impressive feat, and one that is deeply ingrained in the life of the community of Ness. I will say no more about it than that, though. Previously, my high praise for the guga hunt has earned me a permanent place in the demonology of certain militant, London-based supporters of gannet rights.</p><p>I could go on, but my point is this: the things that tourists want to see when they come to Scotland are, to a large extent, things that have some basis and support within the community. That is not a case against innovation&#8212;far from it. The more communities with festivals, the better. However, the strongest and most enduring festivals always focus on something in the community&#8212;be it urban or rural&#8212;that is specific to that place and celebrates it. Tourists like our festivals and, despite what we may imagine, the more mysterious and incomprehensible they are&#8212;the more inscrutably local they are&#8212;the better they like them.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "17369540", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland's Festivals"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Aside from the Edinburgh festival, I am sure that there will be healthy competition among us all today to get in the most references to the local festivals in our respective constituencies.

In the interest of fairness, I should say that Labour had one worse election in the Western Isles in 1924.</p><p>However, I will avert my eyes from all that and concentrate on the reasons why so many people in the Commons argued for dissolution or struggled lamely to argue against it and, more important, why all politicians would do well to understand that the public's patience with the current United Kingdom Parliament is now at an end. The reason for that is certainly the expenses scandal: not only the transgressions of individual MPs and peers&#8212;spectacular as some of those have been&#8212;but the fact that the present United <place-holder colnum=\"18274\"/> Kingdom Parliament spent four years fighting tooth and nail through the courts and elsewhere to conceal the scandal rather than address it.

One fear is that all politicians are on the take, and the other is that their vote has not been counted. As far as the first fear is concerned, I do not need to elaborate on the disaster movie that is unfolding elsewhere. As <place-holder colnum=\"17462\"/> for the second, the experience of 2007 is certainly instructive.</p><p>We have rehearsed many times both here and in committee the huge organisational problems that occurred in May 2007, when the local government elections took place on the same day as the Scottish Parliament elections. The bill seeks to restore public confidence in the electoral system by making the crucial simplification of decoupling local and national elections and ensuring that they take place on different days.</p><p>Although the bill's primary concern is local government elections, I believe that, given what happened on May 2007, it will have a significant impact on the running of parliamentary elections. For example, in my Western Isles constituency, 446 of the more than 13,000 parliamentary votes that were cast were spoiled; in other words, 3.27 per cent of those who tried to vote had their votes disallowed. For the local government elections, the figure was 310. As in other areas, the amount of votes rejected in 2003 was, in comparison, tiny. For example, in 2003, only 74 ballot papers were rejected in the Scottish Parliament elections and only 78 in the council elections.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee took a lot of evidence on the very significant discrepancy between the 2003 and 2007 elections. Although the coincidence of council and national elections on the same day does not explain the whole problem, it certainly explains part of it. In 2007, many votes were disallowed because those who were casting them simply did not understand the difference between the two voting systems. That said, it is interesting to note that the 4.25 per cent figure for rejected constituency parliamentary ballot papers in Scotland as a whole was significantly greater than the percentage in the Western Isles, which perhaps confirms that, as many of us already knew, the people of the Western Isles constitute an unusually politically sophisticated electorate. I am therefore happy to support these moves to decouple local and parliamentary elections and to move back local elections until, eventually, they are held at the midpoint of the parliamentary term.</p><p>To those who fear that, cut loose from national elections, council elections will suffer from low turnout, I have to say that I do not accept the argument that election turnout should be boosted at all costs. We desperately need to revive our local economy, and that cannot be achieved without a genuine public debate about local rather than merely national political issues. Holding elections on the same day simply to inflate turnout artificially creates a democratic deficit as local issues are crowded out by the coverage of parliamentary elections. I believe that there is a consensus on that view; indeed, I am glad to see <place-holder colnum=\"17463\"/> that Mr Tolson has become part of that happy consensus, no matter which tortuous and convoluted route he has taken to get there. The current coupling of local and Scottish parliamentary elections means that local elections receive almost no media coverage in their own right and the record of local councils goes almost undiscussed.</p><p>I welcome proposals to publish voting information from local government elections in more detail. Under the proposed measure, individual votes will remain anonymous and extremely useful information will be made public.</p><p>I hope that members will endorse the bill's principles in order to simplify the process and make Scotland's local government elections more transparent. If the experience of 2007 is not enough of a reason for decoupling elections, I do not know what is. However, it should be said that the picture in 2007 was not one of universal chaos. In fact, the greatest immediate problem that arose in the Western Isles as the votes were being counted was that the helicopter that was due to pick up the ballot boxes from Barra and Uist did not leave Inverness because of erroneous reports of fog, delaying the result by 12 hours. We can and should constantly strive for the perfect electoral system&#8212;and we shall have reached perfection if we can devise a system that also provides accurate weather forecasts. Until then, the bill provides a very valuable start; I support its principles.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14980479", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "People's faith in individual politicians can be undermined by many things&#8212;indeed, the potential in that respect is almost limitless&#8212;but their faith in the whole democratic process can be undermined by only a relatively small number of doubts.

His comments indicated that we have reason to be optimistic, not only about council housing but about other areas of the social housing sector. In fact, in the Scottish National Party Government's first year, 420 council homes were started. The minister recently announced a massive funding boost of &#163;6.6 million to enable work to begin on new and improved homes for <place-holder colnum=\"16845\"/> rent or low-cost ownership in the isles. The Scottish Government also recently provided funding to the Hebridean Housing Partnership in the Western Isles to purchase land for new housing units in Stornoway and Vatersay.</p><p>One of the major advantages of such initiatives in the Western Isles is that they will provide a much-needed incentive to support the local building trade at a time when serious challenges face the construction industry. Those challenges are a feature throughout the country. The various funding packages provide from one small part of Scotland an example of the Government's commitment to help tide the construction and housing sectors over during the recession.</p><p>I doubt that I will be the last person today to point out that decades of Labour mismanagement have meant that far too many people in Scotland either have a home that is unsuitable or do not have a home at all. Let us consider the scale of the problem that the Scottish Government has inherited. It is worth remembering that, in Scotland as a whole, more than 200,000 people are on local authority waiting lists. When the SNP Government came into office, it made it clear that addressing that situation was one of its priorities. That is why, last year, the Government launched a &#163;25 million fund to enable councils to build new council houses, and it is why Nicola Sturgeon recently announced that that fund would be doubled to &#163;50 million.</p><p>Local authorities have applied keenly for a share of that money, and the first &#163;17 million has been allocated among 14 councils. It allowed 5,700 social sector homes to be started in 2007-08; in 2008-09, an even greater number&#8212;6,200 completions&#8212;is projected throughout Scotland.</p><p>In response to the economic downturn, the Scottish Government&#8212;as was referred to by the minister&#8212;has accelerated &#163;120 million, I think, of capital expenditure on affordable homes to help the Scottish construction industry. This year, the significant sum of &#163;644 million is being invested in affordable housing.</p><p>In the current economic climate, the draft housing bill is a vital step to ensure that we have a thriving social housing sector that meets the needs of new and existing tenants. One of the most welcome measures in the draft bill is surely the scrapping of the right to buy in relation to new-build social housing. At last, social landlords and local authorities will have the incentive and freedom to build new houses without the fear that they will be lost to tenants who exercise their right to buy. Even the Government's most hard-hearted political opponents must be able to find it in those hardened hearts to welcome the ending of that perverse situation, although after listening to Mr McGrigor, I fear that I may be being overoptimistic.<place-holder colnum=\"16846\"/></p><p>It is estimated that between 2012 and 2022, the reforms to the right to buy would retain between 10,000 and 18,000 homes for low-cost rent that would otherwise be lost to private ownership. That demonstrates the huge advantage to Scotland's social housing stock of changing the way in which the right to buy operates. That was proposed in the Scottish Government's \"Firm Foundations\" consultation in October 2007, when 94 per cent of those responding to the question agreed that the right to buy should be suspended in relation to new-build homes.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14955137", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the Minister for Housing and Communities said, the figures are due to be published shortly.

There is now serious evidence that waiting lists in a range of key services are reducing, and the motion recognises the achievements of the previous and current Administrations in that.</p><p>Waiting times are important not just because punctuality is popular but because, as we all know from our respective constituency mailbags, every patient understands the clinical importance of speedy treatment, which is key to providing the best outcomes.</p><p>Reducing waiting lists is worth the effort because, in the long run, it saves time, energy and resources by cutting out the bureaucracy of managing and administering queues and backlogs for treatment. It reduces inequalities by addressing variations in waiting times between NHS boards and hospitals, and it wipes out the postcode lottery in health care that prevailed under the previous Executive's stewardship. More important is that decent waiting times have a clear human benefit. They reduce unnecessary uncertainty, concern and sleepless nights for patients and&#8212;most important&#8212;they lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The Scottish Government has invested &#163;270 million in Scotland's health boards to ensure that waiting times are at their lowest since the relevant records began. It is significant that the Government has abolished the availability status codes that were established simply to doctor the figures.</p><p>We are fostering a new relationship with patients by providing them with a legally binding waiting time guarantee. Although others have already alluded to the fact, it is worth mentioning again that, when the Government came into office, it inherited 30,000 patients who had been kept off waiting lists.</p><p>The vision is for a truly mutual NHS, in which patients have a say in how their health service is run and organised and a direct say in how they are treated. If we are serious about that, patients have a moral right to know exactly what treatment they will receive and when it will be carried out. Health care should not be something that is simply done to them.</p><p>In July last year, the NHS celebrated its 60<sup>th</sup> birthday. One of the many ways in which the event was marked was by a visit by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to the Uist and Barra hospital in my constituency, where she initiated a variety of new services. The point was made then&#8212;and holds now&#8212;that the agenda to reduce waiting times is inseparable from the <place-holder colnum=\"16465\"/> agenda to reduce, where possible, the distances that patients have to travel for treatment. I will not rehearse the distances that are involved for patients in the Western Isles. Suffice it to say that cancer patients in Uist and Barra were relieved to get a chemotherapy service up and running locally in recent weeks, to save them the exhaustion and distress of a regular two-day round trip for treatment.</p><p>I know that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing will be concerned that, in recent days, Highland Airways has unexpectedly refused to transfer the materials that are necessary for the chemotherapy service, citing a gap in its safety certification&#8212;despite the willingness of NHS Western Isles to pay at least part of the cost of certification and to provide necessary training. I know that NHS Western Isles is working actively to persuade the airline to adopt a more sensible position.</p><p>I hope that we now recognise more fully that, just as people have a right not to be subjected to unreasonable travelling times, they have a right to be treated within a reasonable time. With that in mind and with, I would like to think, at least some support across the chamber, the Government has published a consultation on a patients' rights bill. It is vital that patients should see themselves as active partners in life-changing decisions. We want to ensure that they are respected and have entitlements set in statute to ensure that their access, safety and participation are valued and delivered.</p><p>As other speakers have mentioned, from December 2011, 18 weeks will be the guaranteed maximum wait for treatment of non-urgent patients following referral by a GP, although most patients will be seen more quickly. The 18-week guarantee is distinct from previous waiting time targets in that, rather than focus on a single stage of care, it focuses on what will be termed an 18-week referral-to-treatment standard. Rather than there being a target time from the GP referral to the first out-patient appointment and then a time from someone being put on a waiting list until treatment is delivered, the RTT standard will address the whole patient care pathway, from receipt of a GP referral up to the point at which each patient is admitted to hospital for treatment. That approach has the advantage of introducing a uniform standard for access that is less complex and should, therefore, be better understood by patients and health professionals alike.</p><p>The referral-to-treatment standard will be delivered through a service transformation programme that will engage with NHS boards and look at best practice. The employees of NHS Scotland will play a crucial role and, thanks to the increased investment that we have provided, the <place-holder colnum=\"16466\"/> overall number of staff who are employed by NHS Scotland has increased and the number of clinical nurse specialists is at an all-time high.</p><p>Although all the steps that I have described will make a real difference to reducing waiting times in the short term, Scotland is clearly taking a longer-term and more holistic view of health, of which waiting times are only a single but important part.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14912951", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hospital Waiting Times"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise that I cannot stay for the closing   speeches because of a matter that has arisen in my constituency.

Aside from the few businesses that I have mentioned, virtually all the industries on the islands are made up of small businesses. Therefore, on the islands as elsewhere, it is important to create the environment for wider economic growth&#8212;whether by cutting the cost of transport, as the Scottish Government has done, or by cutting the cost of fuel, which the UK Government has not done. Fuel duty comes within the remit of the UK Government.</p><p>All the encouraging examples from the islands have a common theme, and it is a theme with a wider application. For a country such as Scotland to come out of a downturn such as this one, its Government must play a proactive role.

The opportunities that it presents for anecdote and stand-up comedy are slight&#8212;although I am sure that Jamie Stone might be up to even such a challenge&#8212;but the more substantial issue is that the debate has emphatically not been on the kind of planning questions about which our constituents generally write to us. Although constituents sometimes write to us about national projects, local planning matters are generally what grip people's attention in our respective communities. That said, I know that I have received e-mails from organisations as varied as RSPB Scotland and licensed trade bodies about the issues that are raised in the Local Government and Communities Committee's report. For instance, I have been given arguments for a framework to deliver a landscape-scale ecosystem that would link the urban areas of the central belt in a green corridor.</p><p>Although the evidence that we took inevitably strayed at times into discussions on the merits of individual projects, the remit of the report&#8212;and the remit of my remarks&#8212;is very much about process. Therefore, I welcome today's opportunity to debate the committee's report on the \"National Planning Framework for Scotland 2: Proposed Framework\", which is a significant document that maps out Scotland's development as far into the future as 2030. Although 21 years might not represent a long time to a giant turtle or to the House of Lords, for elected politicians whose horizons are notoriously short such a timescale <place-holder colnum=\"15570\"/> represents a welcome degree of foresight. Moreover, the decisions that are reached on the projects in NPF 2 will be with us for much longer than 21 years.</p><p>The committee's experience of considering the national planning framework was generally positive, although there are certainly lessons to be learned, given that this was the first time that the Parliament has gone through the process. The report states clearly:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee welcomes the production of the second National Planning Framework. It acknowledges that the NPF2 will play a key role in co-ordinating policies with a spatial dimension and aligning strategic investment priorities.\"</p><p>This is the first time that a national planning framework has been subject to consideration by Parliament and its committees. The Local Government and Communities Committee is grateful to both the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee and the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee for their detailed consideration of the issues in their reports and for their important contribution to the process. The committee would also like to thank all those who made written submissions.</p><p>As I said, the committee's report is generally positive. The committee</p><p class=\"indent\">\"welcomes the fact that the National Planning Framework is now on a statutory footing and is subject therefore to scrutiny by the Scottish Parliament and others. As an evolving document, the Committee acknowledges that it will be open to further scrutiny and monitoring and the Committee will take the opportunity to do so through continuing dialogue with the Scottish Government, the public and with stakeholders.\"</p><p>An extensive consultation programme was undertaken by the Scottish Government to engage with stakeholders and the general public. While recognising that point, the committee also acknowledges that it was perhaps inevitable that, given the subject matter, the consultation was not likely to engage community groups in quite the same way that a local development plan might. However, the committee's report is clear on the importance of engagement, despite the relatively low level of response from the public. The report also stresses the need to make such material comprehensible if public consultation is to be meaningful&#8212;necessarily difficult though much of that material is.</p><p>Another lesson that the committee felt could be learned for the future relates to developing the list of national developments. As has been said, the committee felt that the Scottish Government should engage with those who suggested national developments whose inclusion in the framework was ultimately rejected. I note that the minister has indicated that he is open to that idea. Indeed, one <place-holder colnum=\"15571\"/> of the report's recommendations is that the Scottish Government should continue to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"publish in future an <em>Assessment Matrix of Candidate National Developments against the National Development Criteria</em>, but that this should provide more detailed analysis and reasons why candidate national developments were accepted or rejected\".</p><p>The committee looks forward to hearing how the Scottish Government intends to improve the consultation process and public awareness more generally.</p><p>As I said, rather than consider the specific national developments&#8212;we are grateful to the other committees that reported on those&#8212;the committee has indicated ways in which the process of selection might evolve. For instance, our report recommends that more information be provided on the status of individual national developments in terms of their relative priority.</p><p>In his opening speech, the convener emphasised the committee's view that, when possible, publicly funded infrastructure projects might be brought forward. I know that that reflects much of the Government's thinking.</p><p>I also draw attention to the contributions of other committee members. David McLetchie pressed the nuclear button, but I will resist the temptation to respond to that, as I am speaking on behalf of the committee. Malcolm Chisholm made a plea for projects in his constituency and created the opportunity for the minister to refer to his ancestors. Alex Johnstone raised questions about consultation and about high-speed rail and nuclear issues. Rob Gibson responded to some of the criticisms of the consultation, especially those from Clare Symonds. Peter Peacock highlighted Scapa Flow and subsea connections in Argyll and elsewhere. Jim Tolson nursed some metaphors about report cards and fast tracks. Shirley-Anne Somerville highlighted transport issues relating to Edinburgh airport and opposed the nuclear option as a solution for altering Scotland's carbon footprint. Cathy Peattie made the case for transport improvements in Grangemouth. Patrick Harvie called for more intensive parliamentary scrutiny of the framework in future and opposed aspects of the report.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14772080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Planning Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The subject matter of today's debate presents problems for the person summing up.

The sea has represented life and, often, death for generations of my constituents. The sea gives my constituency its outstanding beauty and distinctive way of life, and it represents a powerful argument to boundary commissions. I welcome the Scottish Government's commitment to deliver a marine bill and the bill's likely impact on Scotland's seas and marine habitats.</p><p>The Scottish Government's intention to introduce a marine bill follows its success in reaching an agreement with the United Kingdom Government to devolve to Scotland responsibility for all planning and marine conservation issues in Scottish seas to a distance of 200 nautical miles. That agreement, which was announced on 27 November 2008, has been welcomed by interests as varied as Oil and Gas UK, the RSPB and the Scottish Fishermen's Federation. Any proposed legislation that appeals to all three of those at once surely deserves a prize.</p><p>As we heard, the current situation is confusing. Scotland is defined in the Scotland Act 1998 as the land and territorial waters out to 12 nautical miles, but Scottish ministers are responsible for regulating some industries, such as fisheries and renewable energy, beyond those limits to 200 nautical miles. Even within the 12 nautical miles, some activities are reserved to the UK Government, such as shipping, navigation and safety at sea. The situation is arbitrary and makes little sense to those who use our seas for a living or who seek to preserve their environment.<place-holder colnum=\"15329\"/></p><p>There are a number of specific differences between Scotland's seas and those of the rest of the UK, which explains why a distinctive approach is needed. The environmental status of most seas around Scotland differs from that of the seas around the rest of the UK, with most Scottish seas being classed as good or excellent environmentally, whereas the environmental status of most seas around the rest of the UK is compromised or severely degraded. In addition, most of the exceptionally long coast around Scotland is underdeveloped, inaccessible and sparsely populated. Scotland has an incredible 11,000km of coastline, which is 10 per cent of the coastline of Europe.</p><p>There are many good economic reasons for the bill. Scotland's fisheries zone&#8212;that is, the waters that are within 200 miles of the coast&#8212;covers 127,000 square miles of sea, which, amazingly, is nearly a quarter of total European Union waters.</p><p>Scotland accounts for 90 per cent of the UK's farmed fish. There are a significant number of fish farms in the Western Isles and elsewhere. I am sorry to say, of course, that we do not currently have the number of local fish processing jobs that we used to have, or could yet have. The seas around Scotland are some of the most productive in the world and support around 16,000 fishing and aquaculture-related jobs, with more than 60 per cent of the UK's total catch coming from Scottish vessels.</p><p>Scotland's seas are, obviously, essential to fishing communities around Scotland, which is a point that I made recently to the European Commission in Brussels, which seems determined to press Scotland into designating a deeply controversial marine special area of conservation around Mingulay and Barra.</p><p>Perhaps the most immediate and practical argument for the bill is that it will overhaul and consolidate the complete mess of around 80 acts that regulate Scotland's seas at the moment.</p><p>It has often been said, rightly, that this Parliament's land reform legislation is an example of something that Westminster never had&#8212;and never would have&#8212;the parliamentary time or political inclination to do. What goes for Scotland's land probably also goes for its seas. Consolidating all the legislation into one bill should bring cohesion to an area that is vital to the economy and environment of Scotland.</p><p>The complexity of the proposed bill is undeniable. However, that is only because of the complexity of the mess that it seeks to clear up. Scotland's seas deserve a single bill and a single agency. Unfortunately, we might have to leave to another day discussion of the really interesting questions, such as the role of the Crown, what the <place-holder colnum=\"15330\"/> rights to mineral exploitation should be or what the definition is of where the border in the Solway Firth really lies on any given day and at any given level of the tide.

As Christine Grahame pointed out, between 2001 and 2006, the number of deaths in which C difficile was an underlying or contributory factor soared from 170 to 417. Such a massive increase requires dramatic action, and action is being taken that is paying dividends. The tragedy of a single death from a hospital-acquired infection renders all statistics redundant, but we should pay tribute to the health service in Scotland for reducing rates of hospital superbug infections to their lowest levels since records began in 2003.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant change of emphasis has been on the simple matter of hand hygiene. We have come a long way in the 100 years since an instruction went out to all doctors, particularly those dealing with infectious patients, to wash their hands before delivering a baby. It seems scarcely believable that such a reminder was required. No doubt it was resisted by some doctors at the time as an undue interference that called into question their clinical judgment. Patricia Ferguson's story about a consultant leaps to mind when I say that. That single measure 100 years ago resulted in a staggering decrease in mortalities among mothers and babies. Today, we cannot overestimate the enormous significance of improving the hand washing regime in hospitals in tackling superbugs. A zero-tolerance policy on hand hygiene has been announced and compliance is at the highest rate since records began&#8212;93 per cent, which exceeds the Government's targets.</p><p>That is one of the many ways in which the health service is already doing much of what the 15-point plan that is mentioned in the Labour motion calls for. I welcome the consensus that has emerged.

Tha G&#224;idhlig l&#224;idir anns a' choimhearsnachd fhathast. Tha dealbh eadardhealaichte air fad ann, ge-t&#224;, nuair a bheir sinn s&#249;il air an t-suidheachadh am measg nan daoine &#242;ga. Ged a tha t&#242;rr dhaoine ag obair gu math cruaidh airson na G&#224;idhlig anns an sg&#236;re, seo na figearan: tha 117 sgoilearan anns na bun-sgoiltean anns na Hearradh.

Ciamar a bhios sinn a' tionndadh air ais tancair-ola na G&#224;idhlig bho na creagan? Tha mi a' creidsinn gu bheil an Riaghaltas a' d&#232;anamh d&#224; rud gl&#232; chudromach an-diugh airson na G&#224;idhlig. Airson aon rud, tha am plana c&#224;nain a' togail suas inbhe na G&#224;idhlig taobh a-staigh an Riaghaltais fh&#232;in.

Tha e cudromach gum bi an Riaghaltas ag r&#224;dh gum bi e a' meudachadh &#224;ireamh de dh'fhoillseachaidhean a tha rim faotainn sa Gh&#224;idhlig. Tha e soilleir gum bi a' Gh&#224;idhlig aig chridhe \"dearbh-aithne chorporra\" an Riaghaltais agus anns a h-uile template eileagtronaigeach a tha an Riaghaltas a' cleachdadh. Bidh a' Gh&#224;idhlig na ph&#224;irt &#224;bhaisteach ann an obair an Riaghaltais, nuair a bhios ministearan a' toirt freagairt gu puist-dealain a tha a' tighinn a-steach anns a' ch&#224;nan no ann am fiosan naidheachd. Carson a tha an stuth sin cudromach? Uill, na aonar, chan eil e cudromach, <place-holder colnum=\"14579\"/> ach tha mi a' smaoineachadh gu bheil e riatanach. Am measg adhbharan eile, tha cuid de dhaoine &#242;ga a' cur an c&#249;laibh ris a' Gh&#224;idhlig a chionn 's gu bheil iad a' creidsinn nach eil &#249;idh sam bith aig Alba mar dh&#249;thaich anns a' Gh&#224;idhlig. Mar a bha am ministear ag r&#224;dh, tha BBC Alba ag atharrachadh nam beachdan sin agus tha an t-atharrachadh dhan mholadh ag aithneachadh sin cuideachd. Tha e cudromach gu bheil an Riaghaltas ag aithneachadh an aon rud anns an d&#242;igh obrach a tha aige.</p><p>A' tionndadh dhan d&#224;rna p&#224;irt den phlana, tha an Riaghaltas a' toirt taic l&#224;idir dhan Gh&#224;idhlig anns a' choimhearsnachd fh&#232;in, le bhith: a' meudachadh air cleachdadh na G&#224;idhlig anns an dachaigh; a' meudachadh air na tha ri fhaotainn de dh'fhoghlam tro mheadhan na Gaidhlig; a' meudachadh cleachdadh a' ch&#224;nain anns a' choimhearsnachd. Mar eisimpleir, tha an Riaghaltas a' cumail siostam thabartasan s&#242;nraichte gu foghlam G&#224;idhlig agus a' toirt airgead a-steach gus aonadan G&#224;idhlig agus sgoiltean G&#224;idhlig &#249;ra a leasachadh.

Tha e na dheagh chomharradh gum bi a' Gh&#224;idhlig air a \"mhainstreamadh\" ann am poileasaidh an Riaghaltais. Tha taic aig an Riaghaltas airson na G&#224;idhlig gun teagamh sam bith, agus bha e furasta fhaicinn aig deasbad nam ball a bha agam o chionn goirid gu bheil an aon she&#242;rsa taic am measg nam p&#224;rtaidhean air fad.</p><p>Ann an d&#242;igh, ge t&#224;, tha an Riaghaltas direach a' t&#242;iseachadh leis a' ph&#224;irt as inntinniche den deasbad seo, a thachras anns a' chonaltradh &#224;s d&#232;idh an-diugh.

I hope that everyone will take part in the associated event in committee room 3 at 7 o'clock.<place-holder colnum=\"14580\"/></p><p>In a strange way, it gives me confidence that the Government recognises that Gaelic is in a very weak state, as John Farquhar Munro said. Why would I be happy about that? Because we have a plan that deals with things as they are. For instance, there is no place in the world that is more Gaelic than Harris&#8212;there is wonderful folklore and Gaelic is still strong in the community&#8212;but an examination of the situation among the young people in the area paints a different picture. Although a lot of people are working hard to support the language among young people, only 15 or 16 of the 117 primary school pupils in Harris are going through Gaelic-medium education.</p><p>I am happy that the Government recognises how uncertain the state of the language is, and I would have been afraid if the plan had begun with an announcement of the good news that everything was going well in the Gaelic world. How are we going to turn the Gaelic oil tanker away from the rocks? I believe that the Government is doing two very important things today: first, the plan raises the status of Gaelic within the Government; secondly, and more important, it gives support to Gaelic outside the civil service buildings.</p><p>It is good to hear that there will be respect and higher status for Gaelic in the Government, and it is interesting that the Government says that it will increase the number of things done in Gaelic&#8212;it is obvious that Gaelic will be at the heart of the Government's corporate identity. Gaelic will play a huge part in the work of the Government, such as when ministers are answering e-mails and issuing press releases in Gaelic. On its own, that is not important, but it is necessary because, among other reasons, some of our young people are turning their back on the language because they believe that Scotland as a nation has no interest in Gaelic. BBC Alba is changing those opinions, as the minister said, and the practical recommendations in the plan will support that change. It is obvious that the Government has identified that issue.</p><p>I turn to the second part of the plan. The Government will give strong support to Gaelic in the community by increasing its use in the home, the amount that is received in education, and the amount that is spoken in the community. The plan says, for instance, that the Government will maintain the specific grants system to provide funding for Gaelic units and build new schools&#8212;if, that is, the Government's budget receives support at long last. The Government will send out a signal that Gaelic will be mainstreamed in Government policy. There is no doubt that the Government supports Gaelic, and it was evident from my members' debate that there was the same support among all the parties.<place-holder colnum=\"14581\"/></p><p>In a way, however, the Government is just beginning, and the most interesting part of the debate will come after today in the form of the consultation. I am sure that it will raise important questions&#8212;for example, on how we will increase the number of school pupils who are learning through the medium of Gaelic; the collaboration and co-operation that there ought to be among the Government, B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig and councils; and our targets for the number of Gaelic speakers in the 2011 and 2021 censuses.</p><p>I hope that the whole of the Gaelic world will take part in the consultation. I will do so, and I am happy to welcome the plan that is before us today.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14649276", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gaelic Language Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Tha mi a' toirt f\u00e0ilte chridheil gu \u00f2raid a' mhinisteir, gu plana G\u00e0idhlig an Riaghaltais agus dhan chonaltradh a tha a' fosgladh an-diugh.

As members know, crofting is the most marginal of all marginal agricultural activities, to the point where I have seen puzzled looks when it is explained to people from outside the crofting counties what crofting actually involves and how little financial return can be expected from it. The future of livestock in the crofting counties is, as Jamie McGrigor said, crucial to those communities. Lamb prices are often prone to collapse, so the future of cattle is particularly vital if we are to attract new entrants to crofting.</p><p>I have made representations to ministers, asking them to consider the retention of the bull hire scheme in its present form, but I recognise that we should start from our current position. The challenge now is different: it is to ensure that whatever replaces the old scheme meets crofters' needs.</p><p>I welcome the reassurances that the Government has already been able to give: that there will be Government assistance to meet the needs of communities that require to keep a bull; that the Government will be sympathetic to providing the buildings and overwintering costs for that to be achieved; and that the existing stock in Inverness might be disposed of at minimal cost. The question is how we can ensure that all those positive ends are met. This evening's debate provides a useful opportunity to consider that. Crofters who used the old scheme are keen to engage constructively.</p><p>One thing is certain: it is beyond the powers of most crofting townships to keep a bull. In addition to the scale of the financial undertaking, there is the risk. People face the prospect of going all the way to a mart in Perth and, on the basis of a few seconds' inspection, making a judgment that will determine the stock quality of future generations of cattle. There are also practical questions. Where would the bull be overwintered? Who would maintain the buildings? In these days when crofters have other jobs, who would tend to the animal during the day?</p><p>We must also consider&#8212;shall I put it this way?&#8212;the importance of maintaining harmony within crofting communities. I know that the minister understands what is involved in a crofting dispute. I have examples in my live constituency files that have their origins in the 1920s. For that reason, we should, if possible, avoid any situation that leads to debates within townships about which croft should have the bull when.</p><p>There is little to be gained if we do not turn our attention to positive solutions. There is no doubt in my mind that those solutions, albeit that they might <place-holder colnum=\"14147\"/> not involve a centralised stud in Inverness, will have to involve units bigger than individual townships. That means that we will need a continuing Government involvement in some shape or form, if only to allow bigger local units to build up the infrastructure that is needed to find such solutions. In the islands, because of the lack of any viable commercial alternative, there must be continuing Government involvement in the provision of advice on and assistance with the keeping of bulls.</p><p>When I met local crofters to discuss the matter, they raised various questions, including how we can ensure that the state aid rules do not hinder Government assistance and how we can ensure that the resources that the Government allocates to the provision of bulls through the SRDP are, to use an appropriate phrase, ring fenced. If the minister addresses those questions tonight, he will bring us much closer to the solution that we all seek.

Other members have already quoted some of those statistics, but the one that clinched the argument for me was the following, which was provided by the BMA. Someone with 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood is twice as likely to be involved in an accident as someone without a drink in them, but someone with 80mg of alcohol is 10 times more likely to be involved in an accident.</p><p>The current limit of 80mg was set 40 years ago, when Scotland had less than half the number of cars that it has now. In the same period, drink has become more than 60 per cent cheaper. The human cost of all that is only too apparent. In Scotland, one road fatality in nine is drink related, and there are families in all our constituencies who live daily with the consequences of that. Many of them will be known to us through our constituency work.</p><p>I make no case against drink. I would not be in a strong position if I tried to do so. I would no more make a case against drink than make a case against driving, but it is obvious that attitudes to drink driving have changed dramatically. I am old enough to remember when it was not unusual to hear people joke openly about the number of pints by which they had managed to defy the drink-driving law. They invariably hoped that, among their listeners, they would achieve the Robin Hood status that is achieved by poachers on a certain <place-holder colnum=\"13541\"/> type of estate. However, times have changed, and it is time to reflect the changes in law.</p><p>As others have pointed out, no European country apart from Ireland, Malta and Luxembourg regards it as acceptable to drive with more than 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in the body. I appreciate that the point about random testing does not feature in the motion, but I point out that no other country in Europe except Denmark has a law that prevents the random testing of drivers. In our country, police have to jump through various hoops before they can test drivers. They have to suspect that a driver is driving erratically or committing a traffic offence or find that he has been involved in an accident. Case law has established that it is lawful for a police officer to stop a car randomly, but he can do a breath test only if he has reasonable cause, which is usually taken to mean that he smells drink from the driver. That is a convoluted situation. However, I accept that that matter is not in the motion.</p><p>I sympathise strongly with the sentiments of Bill Aitken's proposed changes to Richard Baker's amendment. Mr Aitken rightly comments on the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs&#8212;a phenomenon that is almost certainly on the increase.</p><p>I must confess that there is something about Richard Baker's amendment that I find perplexing and, to be honest, misjudged. I have no doubt whatsoever about Mr Baker's sincerity about the problem of drink driving, as his speech made clear, but his amendment seems to proceed from the assumption that the motion could be signed up to only by political opponents of the UK Government or people who share the SNP's position on the constitution. Other parties that do not support the SNP's position on the constitution clearly support today's motion.</p><p>I do not see what Richard Baker's amendment is all about, nor do I see that our motion is any kind of constitutional Trojan horse. Indeed, much as I would like to devolve powers on road traffic law from Westminster to Holyrood, the motion does not ask the Parliament to sign up to that; it simply seeks to reduce the blood alcohol limit for drivers. Nor is the motion opposed to the idea of the law in this regard being changed on a UK basis. Like others, I would be delighted if the law were changed on a UK basis. However, if that does not happen, we in this Parliament should have the guts to say what our view is.</p><p>The BMA, which speaks with unique authority on the matter, has welcomed all efforts in the Scottish Parliament to raise the issue with Westminster. Mr Baker's amendment enjoins us to participate in the UK Government's consultation on drink driving. Again, I have no difficulty with the UK Government's efforts in the area, just with the <place-holder colnum=\"13542\"/> slowness of its progress. I hope that a UK solution to the problem can be found and that the UK Government consultation will bear fruit eventually. However, if it does not, it would hardly be a revolutionary stance for us to call on the UK Government to act on our concerns about a matter of such cross-party concern as drink driving.</p><p>For what it is worth, I do not accept the argument that different drink-driving laws on either side of the border would be any more heinous than when we had different smoking laws on either side of the border. The public are well aware that criminal justice differs between the two countries. However, the motion does not call for any of that; it does not call for separate legislation. I hope that the motion appeals to everyone, regardless of their constitutional views.</p><p>I hope that the UK Government acts, but if it does not, I am with the BMA when it says that although the matter is reserved, there is full support for Scotland to increase pressure on the UK Government to take action.</p><p>Mr Baker and Dr Simpson said that they believe there is a good case for reducing the alcohol limit. Let us say so as a Parliament. The issue is too important for us not to take a stance on it. If we do not take a stance, we cannot expect much to change soon.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14306679", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drink Driving"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pay tribute to the many members, including Dave Thompson, who have a record of campaigning on drink driving.

Fhuair e an strap a h-uile latha anns a' chiad agus san darna bliadhna aige anns an sgoil gus an do dh'ionnsaich e a' Bheurla. Agus tha sinn a' faighneachd fhathast carson a tha \"hang-ups\" aig t&#242;rr dhaoine anns na h-eileanan mu bhith a' cleachdadh na G&#224;idhlig agus carson nach eil ach cairteal de na p&#224;rantan a' taghadh f&#242;ghlam tro mheadhan na G&#224;idhlig airson na cloinne aca ged a tha a' chomhairle a' d&#232;anamh deagh obair air a' chuspair siud.</p><p>Chaidh a' Gh&#224;idhlig s&#236;os mu 3,800 duine d&#236;reach anns na h-Eileanan an Iar eadar 1991 agus 2001.

I am also thankful to all the Gaelic organisations that have taken part in the Scottish Parliament's Gaelic day.</p><p>Why, though, are we talking about Gaelic again? Why is Alasdair Allan bothering Parliament once more with this subject and, indeed, worse than that, why is he speaking in Gaelic itself? Recently, I heard someone in Parliament who shall remain anonymous making that very point. They said, \"There's a debate next week on sailing. Should we all speak like pirates?\" Well, I am not at all sorry to be speaking in Gaelic.</p><p>On the other hand, I understand the danger of tokenism in this situation. That is why, now and again, I will ask questions in Gaelic in Parliament on many different subjects; I need to remind myself that Gaelic is useful for more than simply talking about Gaelic. Gaelic's current status means that it is just as good for talking about Baghdad as it is for talking about peat. I should apologise to anyone who is listening on headphones, because the alliteration in my previous sentence does not work as well in English as it does in Gaelic. Members should remember that example the next time someone argues that Gaelic poetry is just as good in English. Anyway, this debate is important not only at a symbolic level. Just now, there is a lot happening in the Gaelic world that makes this debate appropriate and useful.</p><p>The Parliament first had a debate of this kind in 2000; in fact, it was the first such debate in Gaelic to take place since the year 1307. At that time, the <place-holder colnum=\"12698\"/> Parliament met in Ardchattan in Argyll, and who was in the chair, Presiding Officer, but Robert the Bruce? What has happened with Gaelic between 2000 and today? For one thing, there is stronger support for it from every party. Ten years ago, for example, it would have been difficult to believe that the language would have its own television channel. The channel has good programmes, its audiences are growing, interest in the language is being encouraged and confidence is growing in the broadcasting industry in the whole of Scotland. However, there is an obstacle: the channel is not available on Freeview, although we are working together to put that right.</p><p>Parliament now has its own Gaelic plan, which adds to its many services in a number of ways. Western Isles Council and the Highland Council recently published their Gaelic plans. I am sure that the minister will say something about the Government's plans and its strong targets for promoting Gaelic, which include ensuring that the 2021 census shows that the number of Gaelic speakers has remained at the level that it was when the 2001 census was carried out. I hope that, for the first time, we are all working to turn back the decline of Gaelic.</p><p>If that is the case, why is my motion on the development of the language? Well, the road between where we are now and a healthy Gaelic language is a long one. There are many reasons for congratulating ourselves, but we must keep our feet firmly on the ground. For example, I know someone on Lewis who understands Gaelic but does not use it at all. When I asked him why, he said that when he started school he only had Gaelic. The teacher told him&#8212;in English, even although she had plenty of Gaelic&#8212;that he would get the strap every time he used Gaelic, and he got it every day in primary 1 and P2 until he learned English. That story shows why many people in the islands still have hang-ups about using Gaelic and why, for example, only a quarter of parents in the Western Isles choose Gaelic-medium education for their children.</p><p>Between 1991 and 2001, the number of Gaelic speakers declined by 3,800 in the Western Isles alone and, in the 100 years between 1901 and 2001, the number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland decreased from a quarter of a million to 58,000. Gaelic will not survive with numbers like that; the choice is growth or death. Bearing that warning in mind, however, we should also acknowledge the progress that has been made. At the moment, 2,200 children throughout Scotland are in Gaelic-medium primary education, whereas in 1985, there were just 24, although I have no doubt that the number must increase without delay.</p><p>It is very important that our policy recognises that Gaelic is for the whole community, not just for <place-holder colnum=\"12699\"/> school. As one little girl said to me, \"Why does every single person in my village talk to me in English? Do they not believe that I have Gaelic?\" We must strengthen the place that Gaelic has in the community, whether that means using ulpan Gaelic immersion courses, or anything else. Gaelic is a part of our history, our culture and our nature. If we lose it, we will lose something that is priceless. The language is in a dangerous state, but it is also in a hopeful state.

[ <em>Interruption.</em> ] Mr Neil's sneeze was not one of the more useful contributions, but there were many others.</p><p>All members will cherish their own recollections of the chaos on election night, and we have heard many of them recited this morning. I am not sure whether all of them have met Mr Whitton's stringent criteria for interesting stories, but, for my part, I must say that the council staff in Stornoway acquitted themselves extremely well, although there was a 12-hour hiatus between the counting of the votes from Lewis and Harris and those from Uist and Barra, which certainly heightened the sense of drama. That hiatus was a result not of the computer failures that other members have referred to but of an erroneous forecast for fog, which led to the helicopter not turning up, which just proves that we cannot prepare for every eventuality.</p><p>Many other colourful episodes from around the country have now entered into political legend: the widespread failures of computers and counting machines; the ballot box that fell into the sea; the returning officer who failed to add up one party's list vote and came extremely close to announcing an erroneous result; the scarcely believable spectacle that other members have mentioned of a representative of the company that was tasked with organising the process going on television to say that things were going \"incredibly well\"; and, of course, the voter who lost the place altogether and attacked one of the rather flimsy new style ballot boxes with a handy golf club.</p><p>Greater than the sum of all those individual farces, however, was the level of voter confusion <place-holder colnum=\"11677\"/> that the design of the ballot papers seems to have caused. It is worth saying that the committee surprised itself with the degree of consensus that it was able to muster, on the whole, when assessing evidence relating to the parliamentary and council elections and in assessing Mr Gould's recommendations.</p><p>The committee, like the country, felt instinctively uneasy about the sheer number of discounted votes in 2007, and felt even more uneasy to discover that, in some parts of the country, the question whether a possibly spoiled paper should be rejected was being adjudicated by a computer, without any human intervention. As Mr John Wilson and Mr Doris pointed out, the number of spoiled papers in the local government vote, while higher than in previous local elections, was lower than the number of such papers in the parliamentary vote. That is surprising, given that the local elections were using an entirely new voting system.</p><p>Serious concerns have been raised about our democratic system, but we should be careful not to overstate them, real though they are. Mr Stephen strayed into overstatement in some of his language; indeed, I felt at certain points of his speech that I was listening to a description of the infamous presidential election in Liberia in the 1920s, in which the winning candidate claimed a majority that was estimated to be around 10 times the population of that country. The committee thought that the real concern was not that significant numbers of voters had voted for someone else by mistake, but that voters had been denied the opportunity to participate at all. That is a serious matter in any democracy. The committee made its recommendations in light of those problems. It is pleased that the Government has already acted on most of what it recommended, and the minister confirmed the Government's intentions.</p><p>The committee's convener provided a comprehensive outline of our recommendations, but it is worth recapping the report's main themes. A key theme is that national and local elections should be separated, a view that seems be shared almost across the chamber. In that context, I make a mental note not to quote out of context and cheaply at any point in the future Mr McLetchie, who said that separation is desirable. National and local elections need to be separated, and not just for practical reasons, although such reasons are considerable. The committee's report clearly shows, as Mr Hepburn said, that there is a growing feeling that councils deserve to be assessed by the voters on their merits.</p><p>The committee agreed with Mr Gould's recommendations on the fractured nature of election administration in Scotland and supported <place-holder colnum=\"11678\"/> the creation of a single chief returning officer post for all elections in Scotland. It also recommended that, if practicable, sub-ward level information on the 2007 local government elections should be released. Members will know that when the Scotland Office released equivalent information on the Scottish parliamentary elections, it proved to be veritable meat and drink for the many political anoraks in Scotland, to whom Michael McMahon referred.</p><p>Mr Kelly mentioned voter confusion. Like many members, I have spoken to many voters who failed to fill out half of their parliamentary ballot papers simply because they read at the top of their paper that they should make one mark. That illustrates the confusion that reigned in many parts of the country.</p><p>The committee also recommended that the Scottish Government explore the greater use of postal voting, and it is keen to hear more about the Government's proposals on personal identifiers.</p><p>It is difficult to talk here, as it was in the committee, about any of the recommendations that I have mentioned and stick within the Parliament's own responsibilities&#8212;that is, it is difficult to consider only local government elections. Believe me, I am straining every politically consensual sinew that I have not to stray into a debate about reserved powers, but Gould, the committee and the minister have all said that there must be far more cohesion in the organisation of different elections in Scotland. That means that the Scottish Parliament must have more of a role in running Scottish parliamentary elections. Numerous members have made that point.</p><p>The committee was content with a motion that the Parliament passed on 10 January, which stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"That the Parliament welcomes the Gould report, including the recommendation calling for the further devolution of executive and legislative powers to the Scottish Government and the Parliament for the administration of its own elections\".</p><p>The committee thought that there could be no clearer view of the Parliament's position than that. The Parliament did not open up such tempting questions as whether it should have increased powers over its own composition, the extent of the franchise or the use of STV&#8212;Mr McNulty colourfully raised that issue. It simply said that, like any normal Parliament, the Scottish Parliament should be able to administer the operation of the election process, and that to do that, there should be an increase in the relevant executive and legislative powers available to it in Scotland. The committee was content to associate itself with that sentiment because it recognised that council and parliamentary elections in Scotland must be seen <place-holder colnum=\"11679\"/> as a single democratic process to some extent and that they should certainly administered as such.</p><p>It is clear that it is now time to move on and ensure that we get things right the next time round. The report shows that there is the will in all the parties that are represented in the Parliament to do just that. In that spirit, I commend the report's findings to the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The committee would like to thank the chamber for what has been, on the whole, a positive debate that has featured many useful contributions.

Last year, the greatest threat to the sector came from the inability to move livestock to mainland markets, which was coupled with a long-term threat that it might prove to be impossible to import rams from the mainland.</p><p>The outbreak fell at the worst possible point in the agricultural year. The problem, of course, originated some 500 miles away and was not of the Scottish agricultural industry's making. It was not the fault of English farmers, either. Unlike in the 2001 outbreak, there was little mystery this time about where the virus had come from&#8212;there was no need this time to speculate about whether pigs had been fed Chinese food. The foot-and-mouth virus that has destabilised the farming industry in Scotland was, as we know, released in error from a UK Government lab. Nonetheless, it fell to Scotland to act quickly to minimise disruption here, and the Scudamore review praises the Scottish Government for doing just that, saying that there is widespread agreement that the Government here handled the situation well. Indeed, within three hours of the outbreak in England being confirmed, an action plan was put into effect by Scottish ministers.<place-holder colnum=\"11495\"/></p><p>None of that is to minimise the pain that ensued. However, the fact that action was taken quickly allowed the action to be brought to an end quickly, too, with movements within the islands being among the first relaxations.</p><p>I am sorry but, at this point, the consensual tone&#8212;which I would dearly love to be maintained on issues that are of such obvious consequence to rural Scotland&#8212;will have to be abandoned.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is time the gloves were taken off and, if need be, for battle to commence. If this means that the Scottish government has to publicly, forcefully and loudly promote a policy which is at odds with its Westminster counterpart, then so be it.\"</p><p>Those are the words not of the SNP but of the magazine <em>The Scottish Farmer</em>.</p><p>The one thing that not even the most zealous advocate of the UK Government could argue with a straight face is that the UK Government was helpful on the issue of compensation. There is not the slightest doubt that, although the Scottish Government paid out, the responsibility lay with the UK Government. As the NFUS and many others have pointed out, given that the UK Government paid out after the 2001 outbreak, there is no reason why it should not do so after the 2007 outbreak.</p><p>To this day, the attitude of Hilary Benn, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, remains shrouded in mystery, to put it politely. Over the course of a weekend, his draft speech promising assistance to Scottish farmers and crofters was mysteriously abbreviated to remove such a promise. That was despite the fact that, for reasons that are best known to those who wrote the Scotland Act 1998 and its attendant concordats, although policy on animal welfare is devolved, the budgets that govern it are reserved. If there was any further room for doubt, the Scotland Act 1998 (Concurrent Functions) Order 1999 spells out that the Scottish Government retains responsibility for disease compensation payments made under the tuberculosis and brucellosis legislation but the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will make compensation payments for all other notifiable diseases. All that is even before we bring to mind whose lab it was that released the infection in the first place.</p><p>The reason for bringing all this to the fore a year on is that Scotland has had to find support for compensation from within existing budgets. It has had to use moneys that could have been used to support other areas of agriculture and rural development, despite not having any legal responsibility for making compensation payments.</p><p>If, God forbid, there is another outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, we have to learn from <place-holder colnum=\"11496\"/> Scudamore's recommendations. We should pursue a science-based approach of the kind that Scottish ministers pursued in 2007. As other members have said, we should also examine the case for more localised restrictions on movement, where that is consistent with scientific advice. Above all, we have to act quickly. We must heed Professor Scudamore's call for a clearer set of ground rules between the UK and Scotland; that means that we should revisit the concordats&#8212;which, in many respects and on the face of it, one would have thought were pretty clear&#8212;if they remain open to wilful misinterpretation, as recent evidence suggests they do.</p><p>First and foremost, we have to find a solution that puts to the forefront the interests of our farmers and crofters. We have to ensure that never again are they subject to the kind of disruption that they have suffered as a result of foot-and-mouth disease in recent years. Professor Scudamore's recommendations are to be welcomed in that context.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14038338", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Foot-and-mouth Disease"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Other members have ably recalled the impact that the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak had on Scotland's rural communities.

There has been a positive reaction to the report, but I feel that it would be good to allow the full debate that it has engendered in the crofting community to be held before legislating.</p><p>I want to talk about the Government's education proposals in particular. Tomorrow night, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar will consider a proposal from its education committee to close all seven of its two-year secondary schools over the next three years, so the Government's education proposals could hardly have been announced at a more emotionally charged time for the communities concerned.</p><p>The schools have excellent records and tribute should be paid to the work of staff and the wider community in making them the successes that they are. The council has the right to make its own decision about its closure programme&#8212;although we should remember that the ultimate decision on four of the schools will have to come before ministers. However, the council's decision will pre-empt the bill that will be put before us. Nobody underestimates the hard funding decisions that local authorities are faced with. However, speaking as someone who went to a one-teacher rural primary&#8212;a school that closed&#8212;my view is that pretty much anything that this Parliament can do to make the task of closing a rural primary more difficult will be welcomed in rural Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"10365\"/></p><p>The bill described by the minister contains measures that are likely to find favour throughout rural Scotland. In many respects, it shifts the onus from the community having to explain why a school should remain open to the council having to explain why it should be shut. Things that the bill asks to be considered when a consultation takes place and which are not really considered just now would include the alternatives to closing the school and the impact on the community of closing the school.</p><p>Without minimising the difficulties of school closures in general, there is no doubt that the closure of a rural school has an enormous impact on the viability of the community concerned.</p><p>I am also delighted that, despite the howls of protest from some on the Opposition benches, Parliament is to be presented with a bill to abolish the now totally discredited council tax. I dare not intrude too far into the private grief that is the Labour Party's likely approach to such a bill, but I hope that Mr Kerr is still of the view that is expressed on his website, which is that his own party's stance on the council tax as recently as the last election was \"widely ridiculed\".</p><p>Whatever the eventual stance of Opposition parties proves to be, when we debate the council tax and its replacement in the context of the bill, I hope that we remember the human facts that lie behind the issues. At a time when fuel costs are rocketing, the council tax represents a real and serious injustice to many pensioners and others on fixed incomes.</p><p>The rate of fuel poverty in my constituency was recently measured as being 47 per cent&#8212;that is, 47 per cent of people were spending more than 10 per cent of their income trying to stay tolerably warm. Taking rising fuel costs into account, the rate of fuel poverty in my constituency is now probably nearer 60 per cent. Are we seriously going to advance the argument in the Parliament that we should continue to apply a tax that bears no relation to many of those people's ability to pay? The answers that the parties represented in the Parliament give to that question will certainly be remembered as the temperature falls. Pity the politician who advances the case for the council tax this winter.</p><p>Many arguments have been advanced to commend the Government's legislative programme to Parliament, but the principle of fair taxation must be among the most compelling. The words \"new politics\" might have fallen slightly into disrepute, but if they are to mean anything, it is that the Parliament will be prepared to find a replacement for the council tax that recognises people's ability, and inability, to pay.</p>", "hdate": "2008-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13948269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There can be no doubt about the scope and ambition of the Government's legislative programme.

I hope that we have come some way since such expressions of hostility to the idea of Scottish culture were routine and respectable, so the Scottish Government's proposals on culture in the bill are to be welcomed.</p><p>Every bonfire needs some kindling. The merger between Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council will not only help to declutter our public landscape but will, more importantly, further support Scotland's vibrant and dynamic cultural community. Creative Scotland will build on the work that Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council have already done and will have the freedom to support any form of creative expression. By working in partnership with other bodies, it will play a key part in our aim to promote Scotland's rich cultural heritage&#8212;an aim that all <place-holder colnum=\"9871\"/> members share&#8212;by giving artists the chance to express themselves in every form of the arts. Such partnership working will not only be the case with national organisations but will, I hope, permeate down to local level so that communities throughout Scotland can work towards shared goals.</p><p>We have seen the benefits when national Government works with, instead of against, local government in the new relationship between the Parliament, Government and COSLA, and perhaps there is something to be learned from that single-outcome-agreement approach that would be useful for our relationship with arts funding bodies. A couple of members have mentioned funding for Scotland's languages; one thing that emerges from the debate is that language maintenance is slightly distinct from artistic endeavours that happen to be in one of Scotland's languages. Perhaps there are things that we can learn about structures to help focus our attention on those languages.</p><p>Such successes can come about only when all sides are listened to and given the responsibilities they deserve. To effect change and move Scotland to a new cultural level, every side has to be inspired. That is why there should be no ministerial interference in day-to-day cultural or arts decisions&#8212;even in China, the days when symphonies were written by committee have long since passed. It was apparent from the consultation on the draft culture (Scotland) bill that that was something that the cultural community wanted to make clear. By listening to the community as a whole and to community-based organisations, while leaving responsibility artistically in the hands of creative Scotland, we hope once more to work in partnership with and inspire the cultural community to achieve the positive results that we all want.</p><p>Although the artistic and economic benefits of cultural activity go hand in hand, one slight concern I had with the previous draft bill was the overreliance on arguing for the economic benefits of art and culture. Before we even consider the vast array of physical, mental, social and spiritual benefits that arise from participation in the arts, we should ultimately celebrate the arts because they teach us something.</p><p>The Government clearly has a vision for the arts in Scotland, in which the Government works closely with creative Scotland but safeguards its artistic autonomy. To those who oppose or are suspicious of the bill, I wish only that they could be inspired to share that vision, particularly given that it took others eight years to get round to even drafting a bill, which we have done in our first year of Government.</p><p>There may be some people out there who still long for political interference in the arts or, worse <place-holder colnum=\"9872\"/> still, who subscribe to the view of Scottish culture that is favoured by the unnamed politician whom I mentioned at the start. For someone like that, Gaelic has a phrase: \"B' fhe&#224;rr leam ann an Hiort i.\" I could see her far enough&#8212;or, in fact, more specifically, as far as St Kilda. Happily though, there is no need for us to wish for that.

Before Labour gets too carried away with its conspiracy theories, let it take a reality check, however brief. As Roseanna Cunningham said, we are not talking about McDonald's, Rupert Murdoch or even Bernie Ecclestone. The small business bonus scheme will provide much-needed relief from business rates for all small businesses with properties whose combined rateable value is <place-holder colnum=\"9541\"/> &#163;15,000 or less. As many other members have said, we are talking about a family-run grocer or a joiner with two apprentices; companies employing one or two people, many of whom might well be asking why the principle of progressive taxation should not be applied to businesses as well as to individuals. The plea that business cuts do nothing to help the jobless would be a little more convincing if it did not come from a party that has this week failed so disastrously on its own child poverty targets.</p><p>Iain Gray claimed that the small business bonus scheme would not help economic growth because we are spending less in other areas. He said that, to achieve economic growth through the small business bonus,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Government is cutting in real terms spending on education, transport and enterprise\".&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2008-02-06.5865.5\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 6 February 2008; c 5866.]</citation></p><p>Yet, as the 2007 spending review demonstrates, there has been no reduction in spending on education. The budget for schools will rise by &#163;4.7 million. In addition, rail services spending will rise by &#163;50 million this year, and motorway and trunk road spending is up by close to &#163;50 million. Further, among many other measures, the saltire prize was introduced to help enterprise. Are any of the Opposition parties saying that Scotland's small businesses should not benefit? If they are, they should be straightforward about it. The UK Government makes every effort to make the tax regime harder still for small businesses, not least through the punitive rural fuel tax&#8212;a subject for another day. By contrast the Scottish National Party Government recognises the need for small businesses to grow and flourish.

This debate is about constituents who have contacted me&#8212;as constituents have, I am sure, contacted other members&#8212;to tell me that they cannot afford to travel to work. It is about fishermen telling me that they fear for their livelihoods because of an 80 per cent rise, in some cases, in their fuel costs over the past two years and it is about pensioners saying that they do not know how they will get to the shop because it is some miles away and they can no longer afford to drive there.</p><p>I am pleased to see that hydrogen technology is being pursued vigorously by both Lews Castle College in Stornoway, and by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, which has applied it in some of its vehicles.

More than anything else, they will have been impressed by the warmth of the welcome that the report received from crofting organisations and several individual crofters whom the minister and I visited after the event.</p><p>It is important to emphasise, as other members have, why crofting matters. In case anyone in Parliament is wondering, perhaps understandably, why crofting needs to be so regulated, it is no exaggeration to say that if crofting were not regulated, it would probably not now exist. Indeed, had the crofting acts from 1886 onwards not been passed, it is seriously questionable whether constituencies such as mine would now have any viable populations at all.</p><p>Is crofting still necessary? Does it demand our attention and our parliamentary time? The answer to both those questions is definitely yes. As Mark Shucksmith emphasises, although crofting is in a fairly fragile&#8212;let us be honest, precarious&#8212;position at present, its continued existence in some form is essential. It is essential if we are to maintain any population working on the land in the Highlands and Islands, if we are to maintain Gaelic-speaking communities and if we are to promote the social and economic development of rural Scotland.</p><p>There are undoubted environmental benefits to crofting as well. To take one example, the unique landscape of the Uists and the varied bird life that it sustains would not exist if it was not grazed and unless hay was made there in something like the traditional way. The minister will be waiting for me to make my customary plea for the greylag goose <place-holder colnum=\"8646\"/> population in Uist to be controlled to achieve those ends. I hope that I have not disappointed him.</p><p>Many have used the word \"radical\" to describe the report&#8212;and justifiably so. In recommending the abolition of the Crofters Commission the report recognises that crofters want and need a much greater sense of ownership over the structures that regulate their way of life. I hope that we will take the opportunity to introduce a much-needed element of democracy into the process. As others have said, the separation of regulation from the development functions will be useful in that respect. The strengthening of common grazings committees will also be welcomed in the crofting community.</p><p>Perhaps the most immediate impact would come from the implementation of the recommendation that the rights given to individuals in the Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886 should extend only to those living reasonably locally and using the land beneficially. That recommendation has the potential to go a long way towards tackling multiple problems. If we do it right and implement the recommendation sympathetically, we could cut back on the number of derelict or unworked crofts, making things easier for new entrants, and we could end the speculation in croft land for house building.</p><p>Shucksmith's proposals to enhance the croft house grant scheme and to permit house building by crofters without the need to decroft are extremely useful. Those proposals will be appreciated, not least in areas where there is on-going friction between the need to provide houses&#8212;affordable ones, I hope&#8212;and the temptation to build on the most viable crofting land. I hope that communities will seek imaginative ways out of that tension by promoting building, where possible, on common grazings rather than croft land.</p><p>Above all else, Professor Shucksmith is to be congratulated on seeking to bring some simplicity to a massively complicated area of Scots law. It is an area so complicated that only a handful of lawyers in private practice now specialise enough to know their way through it entirely. The old adage that a croft is a small piece of land surrounded by legislation is quoted to death, but it is nonetheless true. A century and more of laws have been allowed to build up like the layers of paint on the Forth rail bridge. Add to that the byzantine complexities of European Union agricultural regulation and throw in a few bits of ancient Norse law, and we have a massive disincentive for any potential new crofter.</p><p>I hope that we will be bold enough, however we legislate, to simplify rather than complicate as we respond as a Parliament to the report. Elements of important detail will certainly give rise to debates. <place-holder colnum=\"8647\"/></p><p>For instance, the future of the Government's bull hire scheme, which others have mentioned, continues to concern many in my constituency, and there are genuine questions about the viability and availability of commercial alternatives in many areas.</p><p>It is also important that we avoid further cluttering our&#8212;at first sight&#8212;uncluttered Highland landscape. That will mean entering into genuine discussions to ensure that any new structures do not duplicate the functions of community landlords, many of which rightly see development as a key part of their role. There is also the issue of community land buyouts. In the past, buyouts involving private landlords perhaps proved simpler than buyouts involving the man who was recently described as the biggest landlord in Scotland&#8212;the minister. I do not think I am testing parliamentary privilege to the utmost if I mention that one landlord who was rightly bought out in a community land buyout is now languishing in an Australian jail for a serious crime. It would appear that greater complications are involved in buying out Mike Russell&#8212;I hope that the representatives from the west side of Harris who are here today and who will meet the minister will be able to make progress on that.</p><p>The crofting community is clearly enthused by what it has heard from Professor Shucksmith. The Parliament has passed far-sighted legislation on crofting and land reform in the past and, as one or two members have mentioned, it has also wisely avoided bad legislation. Crofters are clearly looking to us as a Parliament to respond, as legislation is undoubtedly now required. I hope that the ideas in the Shucksmith report, which was commissioned by the previous Executive but presented to the new Government, can command cross-party support. Crofters certainly deserve that.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13660123", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Crofting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest, although not a financial one, in that I am an associate member of both Storas Uibhist and Harris Development Ltd.

I hope that the debate will raise awareness about a common condition and help to broaden and deepen the political consensus that specialist epilepsy nurses have a greater role to play in the future.</p><p>I read that one in 129 Scots has epilepsy, so I declare an interest in the statistic: there are 129 members of the Scottish Parliament and I have epilepsy.</p><p>I have seen startling displays of lack of awareness of the nature of the condition. What most comes to mind in that context is the man from Alabama with whom I shared an office at the University of Aberdeen, and with whom I never quite managed to share the information that I had epilepsy after I caught sight of a tome on his bookshelf entitled, \"Satan Cast Out, or the True Causes of Epilepsy.\" The greatest lack of awareness was my own&#8212;not only when I suddenly developed epilepsy at 18, but for a long time thereafter. I was pretty ignorant about my condition. However, I have been very fortunate in that my seizures have been gradually brought under control to the extent that I have been without symptoms for the past four years.</p><p>My knowledge of what was happening with my health was ropey and it was not helped by my attitude. It is fair to say that I was not the model patient. It took me a full year to find strategies that were equal to the task of overcoming my absent-<place-holder colnum=\"7607\"/> mindedness to ensure that I always took my pills. If my mother is listening, I say to her that I now always do that. If she is not, I will say that when a doctor told me at 18 that drinking \"might exacerbate my condition\", I took the word \"might\" to undermine the strength of his argument, if not to discredit it completely.</p><p>I do not advise anyone else with epilepsy to conduct the same experiment that I conducted when, as a student, I was cycling home one day. Feeling the first symptoms of a seizure, I took the gamble that if only I pedalled fast enough I would have just enough time to get home before slipping completely into unconsciousness. Happily, my plan worked out fine, but I would not try it again.</p><p>More than anything, and with absolutely no disrespect to them, the doctors whom I consulted from time to time had very little idea of the medication I should take, or of how much, or when. That is not a criticism of those doctors; they were frank about the process being one of trial and error. I saw consultants infrequently and had brain scans that may have told the hospital something, but which told me nothing at all. Between those infrequent visits, I ignored my epilepsy, except on the four or five occasions a year when I was ill. Between those times, I offered the occasional suggestion to my GP on whether the dose should be put up or down. I had absolutely no rational basis for those suggestions, however. In the end, I took roughly the doses that I felt I should take, given that my medical notes and prescriptions never seemed to agree on the correct dosage.</p><p>I cannot help but think that if I had had even occasional contact with a specialist epilepsy nurse, I might have received practical information and probably the occasional&#8212;productive&#8212;telling off. When I was first diagnosed, an epilepsy nurse would have been a considerable reassurance to my parents. They would have ensured that a more systematic attempt was made to get the correct dosage.</p><p>The only real frustration&#8212;now, at last, it has been overcome&#8212;was not being able to drive, which is a significant problem in the Western Isles. After having gone the required year without a seizure, I started the lengthy process of learning to drive.

Seventeen per cent of Scottish households are officially in fuel poverty; in the Western Isles, the figure is 42 per cent or, if we aggregate the last three surveys, 46 per cent. In other words, getting on for half my constituents are paying more than a tenth of their income just to keep tolerably warm.</p><p>Some of the reasons for that are obvious enough: the wind-chill factor; the ageing population; and the unavailability of mains gas in most areas of the islands. There are also some distinct historical reasons. Government grants in the 1930s were designed to get people out of the thatched black houses, and another wave of housebuilding took place in the 1970s. The new houses were not all fuel efficient and many of them are now in need of significant repair. The most recent Scottish house condition survey indicated, unsurprisingly, that dwellings in the Western Isles score among the lowest in Scotland according to national home energy rating measurements. In the islands, 92 per cent of houses scored 6 or under on the 10-point scale.</p><p>Many people in the islands live in what might, at first sight, be classed as private sector accommodation, but their houses are in fact tied to crofts and to crofting legislation&#8212;and that is not to mention the several hundred people who are waiting to get a house at all. The islands have a huge task on their hands to deal with that legacy of inefficient and ageing housing stock, which was recognised by the Government's recent decision to dedicate an extra &#163;750,000 to the housing repairs budget in the islands.</p><p>Given all that, like many other members, I looked hopefully to the UK budget for signs that fuel poverty would be genuinely tackled, but that hope was largely confounded.</p><p>I welcome any initiative, however small, to get a better deal for people who use prepayment meters, but the call from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the energy companies to spend an <place-holder colnum=\"6927\"/> extra &#163;50 million on social tariffs must be seen in two telling contexts. First, the social tariffs are not mandatory for the companies. Secondly, the sum amounts to less than a week's profits for them.</p><p>Whatever Westminster's failures in this area, I hope that we in Scotland can take a lead. Therefore, I welcome the freeze in council tax, which will, slowly but surely, take people out of fuel poverty. As the Scottish fuel poverty statement of 2002 made clear, it defines household income net of council tax.

If we categorised urban Scotland as either rich or poor, we would be dealing in some fairly serious generalisations. For instance, the report rightly points to the welcome economic growth and population increases that have occurred in the Highlands and Islands as a whole, but it also acknowledges, as members have mentioned, that such growth is far from uniform. The population decline in and economic fragility of areas such as the constituency that I represent are very real.</p><p>The growth in the rural population is welcome, but the report shows that areas of multiple deprivation in the Highlands and Islands coincide with the areas of greatest remoteness, not least among which are the island communities. It is no disrespect to either area to say that Harris is an economic world away from the commuter belt of Inverness. The reasons for that are not hard to find.</p><p>It will come as little surprise to members that, as far as I am concerned, transport policy is highly important in promoting economic growth in rural Scotland. As other members from remote and island constituencies will be aware, transport issues can pose difficulties for island communities and put a brake on economic growth. The OECD report makes it clear that Scotland's rural communities have immense economic potential. However, that potential, I contest, simply cannot be realised when it costs &#163;350 to take a lorry one way across the Minch or when a tourist must be persuaded to part with &#163;81 before he or she can take a car from Oban to Barra. At the moment, a company in my constituency spends more on exporting its product from Stornoway to Ullapool than on subsequently transporting it from Ullapool to Brussels.</p><p>I therefore welcome the fact that the Government has honoured its manifesto promise to pilot road equivalent tariff in the Western Isles, Coll and Tiree. I will leave Mr McNulty to assess and try to fathom his own reasoning&#8212;and taste&#8212;in comparing the RET policy to the policy of exterminating the Kurds. As far as I understand it, that is what he did this afternoon. If I am mistaken, perhaps he can explain where comical Ali comes in.</p><p>For some in the islands, the long wait for Labour to do something about the injustice of ferry costs has given RET a kind of unlikely, mythical status. Some wondered whether they would wait longer to see a ferry arrive from Ullapool offering RET tickets than they would to see one arrive from T&#236;r nan &#210;g. Some in the local Labour Party called RET the economics of the madhouse; others were recently heard to make rash promises about how they would welcome the day that the SNP delivered on its promise. However, the <place-holder colnum=\"6760\"/> Government has delivered on its promise. I hope that the RET study will provide information on the kinds of benefits that, in time, I hope other islands will share.</p><p>Transport is not the only challenge that we face in rural Scotland, but the challenges as a direct consequence of transport links to the islands undoubtedly mean that, in the likes of the Western Isles, it is impossible to tackle other economic problems, such as housing and jobs.

However, we should also be as strong in the statements that we now make about the situation in Pakistan under the Musharraf regime.</p><p>The explanations that General Musharraf gives for his claim to be Pakistan's head of state are fascinating. The general more or less admits that he broke the constitution, but claims that he did so to \"save the country\". Evidently, the rule of law was inadequate for that purpose, so he had to resort to other methods. As has been said, he decided to get himself sworn in as head of state all over again, this time in a suit rather than a uniform, in a desperate attempt to make his claim to constitutionality a bit more convincing.</p><p>What is more important, we all know that any regime that locks up judges when they disagree with the Government has something fundamentally wrong with it. The judges were, of course, among many thousands of people who have been arrested in recent months, which has led to the international community&#8212;particularly the <place-holder colnum=\"4541\"/> Commonwealth&#8212;losing faith in the Government of Pakistan.</p><p>Some people have been squeamish about the idea of this Parliament expressing views on international affairs and on matters that are reserved to another place. However, we can all agree that we should be coming to a view and expressing that view in relation to the situation in Pakistan, partly because Scotland is part of the world and the wrongs that are inflicted on people in Pakistan ultimately affect us all, but, more specifically because, as has been said, Scotland has a substantial Pakistani community whose relatives are suffering as a direct consequence of the uncertainty of the situation in Pakistan. That community seeks a clear indication from Scotland and this Parliament that Scotland stands with them in that concern and suffering. It is worth putting on the record that that concern exists in Parliament.</p><p>Regrettably, Pakistan is now a dictatorship. Although General Musharraf no longer has to explain away that situation in court&#8212;even in the presumably compliant courts that now exist&#8212;he still has to explain it to us and to the world.</p><p>These are difficult international times. As others have pointed out, the threats of terrorism and extremism are real. However, the war on terror&#8212;a phrase that has been rather misapplied throughout the world in recent years&#8212;is nowhere used with more unconscious irony than in Pakistan, where General Musharraf uses it as an explanation for imprisoning people without any good reason and for dismantling constitutional Government, not to mention hand picking who can and cannot stand in elections, if they ever happen.</p><p>I am sure that the Parliament will want to join Bashir Ahmad in making it clear that Scotland has no pet dictators.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13394858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow's Pakistani Community"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I congratulate Bashir Ahmad on bringing this debate to Parliament.

As other members said, tourism contributes some &#163;4.2 billion to our economy each year, and almost 9 per cent of our total employment. The 2009 year of homecoming presents an opportunity at every level, economic and cultural, to make Scotland known globally by renewing our links with the Scottish diaspora.</p><p>It is worth bearing in mind just how distinctive and positive the image of Scotland is to most people around the world. Some years ago, I was in Boston on the way to a ceilidh. In saying that, I do not mean that I had mistakenly ended up in Boston en route to a ceilidh in the Western Isles, although such things have been known to happen. I got off a bus in Boston, wearing Highland dress, and was accosted by an elderly lady who seemed almost overcome with emotion at seeing someone dressed in that way. She told me, at some length, of her husband's ancestry and the warmth of those sentiments was in no way undermined when it quickly became clear that she believed I was Lithuanian. [<em>Laughter.</em>] I did not feel the need to correct her.</p><p>The Government is expending great effort to promote Scotland as a world brand. At local level, there is much that Scotland can do, and is doing, to promote a range of niche tourism markets. Bed and breakfasts are involved in schemes that offer a tailored welcome to niche groups such as hill walkers, mountain bikers, Gaelic learners, and film crews.</p><p>In my constituency, numerous agencies, including Caledonian MacBrayne, have co-operated very successfully to promote a network of so-called Gaelic rings round the west coast of Scotland and, increasingly, we have a basis for food tourism, ecological tourism, sports tourism and so on. However, all that activity requires structures that are fit for purpose, and the restructuring of VisitScotland, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise will enable the bodies to work together closely towards the goal of ensuring sustainable economic development in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393098", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tourism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As many members have said in the debate, there can be no doubt about the importance of tourism to Scotland.

Of course, we should not ignore the significant challenges that are faced by the industry. I am sure that we can all bring to mind certain small problems that we have encountered in the past. For example, when I recently called in at a small hotel at 10 in the morning&#8212;I will not name it; suffice it to say that it was not in my constituency&#8212;and asked timidly at reception whether there was any chance of a bacon roll, I was met with the very frosty comment that I \"might get a biscuit\".

In fact, the real challenges that face the industry are not of its own making; they are problems that do not fit neatly into the tourism portfolio. For example, visitor attractions and B and B owners in my constituency can do as much as they like to promote their businesses, but they will always find themselves at a competitive disadvantage if it costs &#163;200 for tourists to reach them by car and ferry.

Although I do not want to take away from the various works that the Crown Estate does in research and investment, it is ultimately an institution that raises &#163;14 million annually for the Treasury in London. Although that money is raised in Scotland, it is not completely&#8212;indeed, not anything like completely&#8212;returned to Scotland, far less to the communities from which the moneys are generally levied.</p><p>I am afraid that many people seriously question what the Crown Estate is all about. I am sure that Parliament wants to work constructively with the Crown Estate for as long as it exists, despite the lack of any direct parliamentary accountability that it enjoys. I am sure that the Crown Estate will likewise be thick-skinned enough to accept that it is not a popular organisation in many parts of Scotland.</p><p>I will give an example of what I mean. Stornoway Port Authority is among a number of organisations in my constituency that have to deal regularly with the Crown Estate. The authority and its predecessor organisations have been investing continuously in their harbour for a century and a half, yet it still has to lease the seabed underneath it from the Crown. That means that it has to provide the Crown with a payment for every leisure craft that uses the harbour&#8212;a cost that it would be impracticable to try to pass on, even did the port authority believe that it were in the island's economic interest.</p><p>As has been mentioned in respect of other places, Stornoway Port Authority has to lease the foreshore on which its piers are built and on which its own linkspan is built. In 2006 alone, the authority had to pay more than &#163;16,000 in such <place-holder colnum=\"3055\"/> rentals to the Crown Estate&#8212;the community in Lewis must wonder to what end.</p><p>The Western Isles is, like other island communities, in urgent need of economic renewal, and the cost that its communities incur from the Crown Estate has to be passed on to someone&#8212;inevitably, that means the people who use the services. That means, in large part, the fragile fishing industry. The justification for the situation is, as far as I can see, that the foreshore just belongs to the Crown&#8212;except in parts of Uist where the chiefs of Clanranald ingeniously managed to appropriate it a couple of hundred years ago. The reasoning is that the Crown is therefore entitled to expect payments in return for its trouble, but the question is: for what trouble?</p><p>Why is the Crown Estate not accountable to this Parliament? Why is the Crown Estate land not subject to the same principles of land reform as other parts of the land in Scotland? Stornoway is one community among many where people struggle to see why, in the modern age, the Crown can charge communities for use of the sea. As one person locally put it to me, \"They might as well charge for use of fresh air, and it would make about as much sense.\" I appreciate that all those questions may tend towards dangerous conclusions as far as the Crown Estate is concerned, but they are questions that Scotland's coastal communities are asking.

They are willing to do what they do in all weathers, for the most part because they realise that it is integral to their community's way of life and because it is essential to the wider Highland economy.</p><p>However, when lambs are selling for less than &#163;8 each, as they did on one recent occasion in the Western Isles, we are dealing with a situation that is unsustainable for any length of time. To some extent, that has already been recognised and acted on.

The Government in Scotland is going well beyond what it is required to do morally and, I believe, legally. I hope that the actions of the Scottish Government will now shame others into living up to their responsibilities&#8212;because the UK Government most certainly has responsibilities.</p><p>Unlike the 2001 outbreak, there is little mystery this time about where the virus came from. There is no need to speculate about pigs being fed Chinese food; we all now know that the foot-and-mouth virus that has so destabilised the farming industry in Scotland was released from a UK Government lab. That is probably more than a moral argument, but if it fails to impress, there is the argument of precedent. If compensation was made in 2001, why should it not be made now? <place-holder colnum=\"2616\"/></p><p>And if precedent fails to settle the question for some people, there is the small but important matter of the Scotland Act 1998 and its attendant concordats, which so many members hold up to be inviolable and unalterable sacred texts.</p><p>The animal health budget is clearly reserved to the UK.

I went out of mobile range, as always, in Lochmaddy. When I went out of range, I was discussing the forthcoming general election with a journalist who had phoned me. By the time I came back into mobile range, I had learned that there was to be no general election. Within hours of that, the UK Government had reneged on its position on compensation. According to his draft speech, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr Benn, was due to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I have also agreed with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury that Scotland should receive &#163;8.1 million and Wales &#163;6.5 million to assist them in countering the impacts of foot-and-mouth on their livestock farmers.\"</p><p>However, by Monday 8 October, when Mr Benn delivered the statement to MPs, that paragraph had disappeared.

I am not going to claim that fuel poverty is unique to the Western Isles, but the extent of it there is unusual and the reasons are, perhaps, unique. The solutions to the problems that we face have, to a large extent, been set out by Kenneth Gibson in his speech. Mary Scanlon set out some of the reasons why fuel poverty is particularly acute in rural areas.</p><p>In the Western Isles, an unusually high proportion of the population is elderly; there are a lot of people who own private homes that they have inherited or which have come as part of a croft but who do not necessarily have the income to maintain them; there is a cultural reluctance, particularly among old people, to claim benefits to which they are entitled; and there is the apparent slowness of Scottish Gas&#8212;which I have mentioned in Parliament before&#8212;in implementing the central heating programme in the islands, for some strange reason. Furthermore, as has been mentioned, there is the unavailability in most areas of mains gas, which means that there is an unusual reliance on solid fuel. There is also the wind-chill factor. Along with all that, there are problems with the design of many of the houses that were built between the wars to replace the black houses. Many of them now need attention.</p><p>Those factors add up to a startling reality, which is that 42 per cent of households in the Western Isles are in fuel poverty. That is not merely the highest figure in Scotland; it dwarfs the 13 per cent figure for Scotland as a whole. That figure means that almost half the people in my constituency are shelling out a tenth of their income trying to heat their homes. We can safely assume that a significant proportion of them are in severe fuel poverty and will be spending 20 per cent of their income on heating their homes.</p><p>I am glad that we are considering the example of Warm Zones&#8212;it is great to learn from an example in England. One of the great things about having a Parliament is that we can choose what to take and what not to take as examples from other countries.

It systematically assesses households, it brings various agencies together, and it cuts across many of the problems that are caused by, for example, the lack of co-operation among agencies.</p><p>The phrases \"warm zone\" and \"the Western Isles\" are not often heard in the same sentence, but I hope that the experience of the Western Isles, which is the most extreme example of a Scotland-wide problem, provides further fuel for serious consideration of whether the Warm Zones concept can be imported successfully to Scotland.

At first sight, that name is curious, as it means \"eastern village\". It is difficult to understand how one of the most westerly communities in Scotland could ever have got such a name, until we realise that there was once, next door to it, a Baile Siar&#8212;the western village. That was until one night 300 years ago, when Baile Siar simply disappeared permanently beneath the waves.</p><p>I tell that story only to give some idea of the extent to which the Uists are at the mercy of the weather and the tides. There are probably few communities in Europe, outside the Netherlands, where flood prevention is of such dramatic and obvious concern. The islands of South Uist and Benbecula rely heavily on the natural flood defences that have built up on their machairs over the centuries, because many communities in the islands are at or, in some cases, even below sea level. That was illustrated in January 2005, when a storm of unparalleled intensity hit the Western Isles. People were lifted off their feet and caravans, sheds and even the front half of a hotel disappeared without trace overnight. For days, people were without electricity and, in many cases, found themselves living on islands within islands. As Rob Gibson mentioned, the school in Balivanich was also rendered unusable.</p><p>A far more tragic event occurred on the Uist causeway network: three generations of one family lost their lives and a whole community was left devastated. All members will have had the experience of leaving a meeting in their constituency feeling rather humbled. The Minister for Environment and I attended one such meeting recently in Uist. At the meeting, members of the local community, including bereaved relatives, made a polite but straightforward plea for a number of basic coastal protection measures to be taken to prevent disasters of the same kind occurring in future. Those measures were repairs to the causeway network, a hydrographic survey of the coasts, and attention to rebuilding and seeding the damaged machairs. Many members have spoken of soft solutions to flooding problems. The traditional method of coastal protection that the machairs provide is an instructive example of such a solution.</p><p>As the Minister for Environment will testify, the lasting impression of the meeting was of the quiet, <place-holder colnum=\"1950\"/> patient hope of that community.

Nevertheless, surreal as it may be, the saying can be used to describe the political landscape in Scotland, which has <place-holder colnum=\"155\"/> \"changed, changed utterly\"&#8212;a fact that the spirit of the new politics precludes me from celebrating too overtly this afternoon.</p><p>Government has changed and the style of government has changed. That fact is appreciated throughout Scotland, not least by islanders. Islanders in the constituency that I now have the honour of representing are looking to the Parliament both to listen to their distinctive economic needs and to act on them in order to develop the island economy and to maintain the environment and culture that give the islands their distinctive identity.</p><p>If Parliament wants to demonstrate that it is listening to those distinctive needs, it will, for instance, have to listen to the call for the people of Lewis to have a more direct say in the future of their island in terms of wind farm planning. Although I appreciate that ministers cannot prejudge that issue, I was encouraged by the First Minister's comment yesterday that he wants Scotland to become a renewables powerhouse. However, that does not mean that every application for renewables projects is right.</p><p>If the Parliament wants to show that it is going to address the economic needs of the Western Isles and similar places, it will have to address transport. Islanders are aware that the cost of living and doing business in the islands is so high as to be almost unsustainable. Recently, I spoke to a constituent who runs a business exporting goods from the islands. He told me that the cost of getting his goods from Stornoway to Ullapool is greater than that of getting them from Ullapool to Belgium. We would do well to examine the lessons that can be learned from other European countries, where island communities and their transport links are regarded as an integral part of or an extension to the national road network. That lesson can be learned in the Western Isles. I hope that the Parliament will examine it. My party has been at the forefront of that cause, but it has many other supporters.</p><p>No electorate in Scotland is more engaged, attent or sophisticated than that of the Western Isles. Today, it has heard a programme for, or an outline for an approach to, Government that it will find inspiring, not just because it is more open on issues such as the Howat report, but because it is generally and genuinely more open to listening to the voices of others and to the voice of Scotland. The programme or approach can be commended to all of Scotland, from Auchincruive to Acha M&#242;r.</p>", "hdate": "2007-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13383622", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Approach to Government"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mar a tha an sean-fhacal Le\u00f2dhasach a' ruith, \"Is ann caochlaideach a tha a h-uile n\u00ec ach faochagan an Acha Mh\u00f2ir.\" Following is the translation: As the Lewis proverb runs, \"All things are subject to change except the whelks of Acha M\u00f2r.\" The member continued in English.
