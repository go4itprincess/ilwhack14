We all agree that something has to be done about new psychoactive substances. The work that the Scottish Government has done with Police Scotland, the choices for life campaign, outreach support through Crew 2000 and modern technology is welcome. We need to get the message across that new psychoactive substances are dangerous.</p><p>I concur with my fellow members who mentioned head shops. There are a number of those shops in my Glasgow Kelvin constituency and the most shocking thing about them, apart from the paraphernalia that they sell, is that tourists and others can unwittingly walk into them because they advertise other supplies besides these substances, which I believe should be banned. Because some people simply wander into these shops without realising what they sell, and given everyone&#8217;s concern about the issue, I suggest that these shops be looked at. Like other members, I also think that the use of the term &#8220;legal high&#8221; should be addressed as it gives out entirely the wrong message.</p><p>In recent years, new psychoactive substances have rapidly changed the global drugs market. Substances that are not under international control but which mimic the effects of controlled substances are now pretty much widely available and have the potential to pose a serious risk to public health and safety. As other members have pointed out, despite their being marketed as a legal alternative to controlled substances, users cannot be certain of either the health risks of using them or their legal status.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the internet has created a global marketplace, making access to and distribution of these substances easier for people of all ages. It is also important to highlight, as the police have done, the potential for organised criminals to exploit the market for these substances.</p><p>Given the quite frightening speed at which that market has developed, given the wide availability of and access to these substances and given the concerns about their increasing use, the issue has become very significant and it is good that we are debating it this afternoon. However, although it is international in nature and requires collective global action, there is still no standard national or international approach to the matter. I know that many countries have adopted broader legislative approaches to controlling new psychoactive substances. New Zealand has already been mentioned, but I note that on 1 January 2012 an act came into force in Austria controlling new psychoactive substances listed in regulation by the Austrian Minister of Health and which are not subject to the 1961 or 1971 UN drugs conventions. Moreover, in Hungary, Government legislation took effect on 3 April 2012 that created a schedule C to existing legislation listing such drugs appearing on the market. In any case, although New Zealand, Ireland and these other countries have put into effect proposals to stop the supply of these substances, we do not yet know how successful they have been.</p><p>I was very pleased to read the G8 statement of intent on new psychoactive substances, which was published on 25 June 2013 and commits signatories including the UK, the United States of America, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and many others to putting in place a range of measures to address the challenges posed by such substances, and to sharing intelligence on them, their impact on public health and the various supply routes. As all members have made clear this afternoon, we have to work constructively and collectively on this matter. New psychoactive substances represent a danger to the whole of our society, particularly our young people. Last week&#8217;s tragedy in Glasgow has already been mentioned and, of course, my sympathies and everyone else&#8217;s go out to the family affected.</p><p>We need a global approach to the issue. As members have pointed out, the Scottish Government has been doing a very good job but the availability of these substances on the internet makes things very difficult to police. I know that we are working with the UK Government on this but I wonder whether the minister can give us an update on what has been happening in that respect. In her opening speech, for example, she referred to the latest information that is coming out.</p><p>The minister also mentioned the drugs strategy and I hope that we might have a regular debate on it so that we can find out what progress is being made. The issue is certainly important. Certain drugs might be legal&#8212;and I hate to use that term in connection with these substances&#8212;but they pose a particular threat simply because they can be bought off the internet. As Graeme Dey said, anyone can go into one of these head shops and pay X amount of money for these substances but they are a lot cheaper on the internet. Moreover, criminals can get access to a lot more of them.</p><p>There is a lot to be said for this debate. I thank everyone for their good contributions and hope that we can move forward in tackling what is a very serious international situation.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22884031", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Psychoactive Substances"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister and fellow members for their speeches, which have been constructive.

I remind him about the first part of his speech when he talked about missing money. If the Westminster Government had given back money that was used for the Olympics, we would have had more money. Hanzala Malik should know what he is talking about before he starts casting aspersions.</p><p>I am from Glasgow and I represent Kelvin, which is one of the biggest constituencies that is hosting the games. I am happy and enthusiastic about that, as I am for the rest of the people of Scotland and those who will come here from the Commonwealth. As a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association executive, I thank my colleagues and the clerks on the executive committee for the hard work that they have been doing with the Commonwealth games committee to push the games forward with a positive message. That is all I have to say on that particular point.</p><p>I cannot emphasise enough how important the games are to Scotland and to Glasgow, where a number of sporting and cultural events will take place. The bowling competition will take place in Kelvingrove, in my constituency. James Dornan, Patricia Ferguson, Bill Kidd and I had great pleasure in playing a friendly game on the new bowling green against MPs. I will not say what the score was, but we were cheated and the MSPs lost. It was a wonderful day: the weather was good and it was fantastic to be working together to promote the Commonwealth games.</p><p>The bowling green is a legacy for the people of Glasgow and the people of Scotland. I heard John Mason saying that his football stadium is bigger than James Dornan&#8217;s football stadium, so I would just like to tell them that Kelvin constituency is bigger than both football stadiums, and many of the cultural and other events that are taking place just now and will take place throughout the games are taking place in my constituency.</p><p>For example, the Hydro in the precincts of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre will host gymnastics, boxing, judo, netball, wrestling, weightlifting and powerlifting. It has fantastic facilities and they will be the legacy for all to enjoy after the games have finished.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson talked about the games achieving a lasting legacy for Glasgow and for the whole of Scotland, particularly for young people and their participation in more physical activity. Partnership working is key to that and we must consider it, whether it be with the Scottish Government, local authorities or the excellent campaign that the Evening Times is conducting at the moment. Such work must continue after the games to ensure that the games have a lasting legacy.</p><p>Liz Smith mentioned access to schools facilities and the prohibitive costs of that. That has always been a bugbear of mine and I have raised the issue on many occasions. There can be a school&#8212;a public building&#8212;in the middle of a community but the people of the community cannot use it because it is not open or because the costs are too prohibitive.</p><p>I know that I have raised that issue with the minister and with previous Government ministers. Can we please have a word with local authorities in round-table discussions or whatever? If there is a community facility&#8212;in some cases these are swimming pools&#8212;why can the community not use it to access physical activity? Perhaps the minister could have a round-table discussion or perhaps there could be partnership working to ensure that such facilities are able to be used.</p><p>We have mentioned sporting activities and physical activities. Malcolm Chisholm is not here at the moment; maybe he went for a walk for some physical activity. I would probably benefit from that also, as would many people. I look forward to accessing many of the excellent facilities.</p><p>Loads of events are taking place before, during and after the games. We have to remember the great economic benefits that they will bring, not just to Glasgow&#8212;within and outwith my constituency&#8212;but to the whole of Scotland. They will bring cultural benefits, too. I say to Hanzala Malik once again that we welcome everyone. Being a member of the CPA executive, I know exactly how many people are coming from throughout the Commonwealth. We are going to be there to greet them. We will also have something here in the Parliament to greet them. We are reaching out internationally as well as nationally, which has to be something to look forward to.</p><p>I will mention some of the cultural benefits that are coming forward. The Glasgow mela is Scotland&#8217;s greatest multicultural festival. We had more than 35,000 people attend the mela in Kelvingrove park last year. One of the lasting benefits and legacies of that was the &#163;2&#160;million revamp of the Kelvingrove bandstand from the 2014 cultural fund. That bandstand will be opened and it will host other events. It will get its first airing during the Glasgow mela. That is a fantastic contribution to multiculturalism in Scotland. We have to remember that aspect as well.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games and Legacy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The one person who got the whole tone of their contribution completely wrong is Hanzala Malik.

I also thank the minister for her speech and her assurances that stakeholders will be consulted on the guidelines that are to be developed and that awareness-raising campaigns will be carried out in communities.</p><p>With regard to Elaine Murray&#8217;s point about those who have recommended that the UK ratify the convention, I should point out that they included a group of violence against women stakeholders, which was very much in favour of the UK&#8217;s becoming a signatory, and the Scottish representatives on the UK joint committee on women, who have recommended that the UK Government pick up on that point.</p><p>The fundamental and overriding issue is article 37 of the Istanbul convention on tackling violence against women, which requires forced marriage to become a criminal offence. Unfortunately, existing legislation does not meet the requirement in article 37; the legal advice that the Justice Committee received confirms as much. That is one of the most important aspects of the issue. I believe that by agreeing to the LCM we will not only meet our international obligations but retain our own forced marriage protection orders under civil legislation. I firmly believe that those orders, which will not be removed, will provide an additional safeguard to protect those who are at risk.

Unfortunately, due to a family bereavement, he cannot be here this evening. Our sympathies are with him and his family.</p><p>I point out that the motion highlights the work of the Domestic Abuse Project and the CEDAR project in Castlemilk. Back in November I had the privilege of leading a members&#8217; business debate to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid and the work that it does in supporting those suffering from domestic abuse. In that debate we also had the opportunity to acknowledge the CEDAR programme, which many of us know is a therapeutic group-work programme that aims to help both women and children to come to terms with the domestic abuse that they have experienced or witnessed.</p><p>Typically, the group work for children and that for mothers takes place at the same time and, importantly, the groups mirror their aims, such as to express the emotions surrounding abuse. That allows the children and their mother together to continue to explore, understand and come to terms with what they have suffered and experienced. It is a powerful model that helps to promote empathy and empowerment among those attending. It may seem to many that such an approach is a commonsense one, but it is quite innovative in its delivery. It involves a multi-agency approach, bringing together professionals from a large range of agencies across the public and voluntary sectors.</p><p>That type of model is also important not only for the way that it can transform people&#8217;s lives but, sadly, for a more pragmatic reason: at a time when finances are being squeezed there is more need for that type of multi-agency approach. I believe that the CEDAR model offers a great opportunity to make a real difference to people&#8217;s lives and to tackle the thorny issue of how we continue to support some of the most vulnerable people in our society in these times.</p><p>The CEDAR pilot&#8217;s evaluation report noted that CEDAR is contributing to a range of Scottish Government policies and that it represents an opportunity to focus resources in many services.</p><p>In the previous debate that I mentioned, I noted that CEDAR Glasgow had another two years of funding from the Big Lottery Fund and I said that I hoped that the Scottish Government would look to and learn from the CEDAR model in its approach to other forms of intervention. In response, the minister said that a strategy for Scotland to tackle violence against women was being taken forward, that it would be the first such document in Scotland and that it would shape the way in which we tackle violence against women in the future. I hope that debates such as this one will help to inform the strategy and that programmes such as CEDAR will be very much part of it. I understand that the Government will consult on the strategy in early 2014. Perhaps we could tease out some more details of it from the minister in her closing speech.</p><p>I will take a moment to commend those who make this work possible for their hard work and dedication. Some of them are in the public gallery and I met many of them earlier during a drop-in session in the Parliament. I was very impressed by the way in which all the groups work together, including Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid, from which I spoke to Janice, Catherine and Mariam; the CEDAR project, from which I spoke to Kirsty and Isla; and the WAVES group, and in particular Bessie Anderson, who chairs that group.</p><p>I know that James Dornan takes a keen interest in the WAVES group, which helps women to move on from violent environments at their own pace. It was explained to me that, rather than being told to go into certain areas, women take it at their own pace, which helps them to feel much more comfortable if they wish to move on. Women gain confidence from that and benefit from personal development, and they go on to voluntary work and some to colleges. I was very impressed by the contributions of the people at the drop-in session. I apologise to the people I met who I have not been able to name. I am sure that they know who they are. Once again, I thank them for all the hard work that they do on behalf of people.</p><p>When I spoke to my colleague James Dornan, he particularly praised the Domestic Abuse Project in Castlemilk, through which he learned more about the CEDAR project in his constituency. In the past three years alone, it has helped about 100 people each year and, incredibly, 90 per cent of its clients have gained volunteering positions and employment, which I mentioned earlier. That helps them to regain control of their lives. Special thanks must go to all those who help with that.</p><p>James Dornan also learned of the work of Dr Lombard in his research for a debate on the origins of addiction that was brought to the chamber by Kenneth Gibson, who I believe will speak in tonight&#8217;s debate. As a result of Dr Lombard&#8217;s work on how children perceive violence, she noted the need for discussions with schoolchildren to help them to understand what is meant by a healthy, respectful relationship in order to break down gender stereotypes that may, unfortunately, lead to violence in future. Her work is a fantastic read. I am not sure whether the publication is available in the Parliament, but I certainly have a copy of it and I am happy to pass it on to others.</p><p>In our debate on the anniversary of Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid, I mentioned the outreach programme in schools that aims to tackle the issues that Dr Lombard identified in her publication. I hope that her valuable work, alongside the outreach work that is being done in schools, will also inform the Scottish Government&#8217;s future approach to domestic violence. As the minister said in her concluding remarks in that debate, the issue is not only about ending domestic abuse and violence against women. It is also about achieving equality, not just for women but between men and women in our society.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the other speeches and the minister&#8217;s summing-up speech.

That issue has certainly caused much anguish in my constituency in the west end of Glasgow, where people who wished to appeal against a development being built in a front garden of a property, of all places, found that it would cost them tens of thousands of pounds. I appreciate that the Government is progressing recommendations in that respect, because we need to look at the issue. We should not expect ordinary people to have to spend &#163;10,000 or &#163;20,000 on appealing against a development.</p><p>Another issue is the switching of factors. I take on board Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s comments about the Homeowners Housing Panel, which I agree has done a fantastic job. There are problems at times with the two-thirds majority requirement and with absentee landlords, and it is important that we look at those issues. The committee received evidence to suggest that the Data Protection Act 1998 is not a barrier and does not prevent factors from giving out the names and addresses of other proprietors.</p><p>I welcome the minister&#8217;s comments and the Scottish Government&#8217;s move forward in that regard. The problem of absentee landlords is not just about repairs but about getting something done in a tenant&#8217;s property or wherever. It is important that everyone is told about the repairs that are to be done, how much they may cost and where things will go from there.</p><p>I want to comment on the situation of switching factors. I have many cases, as I am sure other members have, but for a particular one involving a property in the centre of Glasgow I have visited both factors and residents. Everything in that case has been done according to the legislation, but even though a new factor has been appointed the previous factor will not pass on information to them and has held on to floats and residents&#8217; moneys. I know that we can go to the Homeowner Housing Panel on the issue, but what do we do when a factor ignores residents&#8217; wishes? That is a very real problem generally and not just in that particular case.</p><p>On repairs issues, factors can be taken to the Homeowner Housing Panel and it can tell them that they are in the wrong and that the residents and home owners are in the right, but the factors can refuse to accept the panel&#8217;s recommendation. What recourse do home owners have in such cases? I ask the minister and the Government to look into that; real issues are taken to the Homeowner Housing Panel but factors ignore the panel&#8217;s recommendations.

I give credit to the present Government and previous Governments for the continued importance that they have attached to this very emotive subject. I am sorry that the debate is not consensual, but I hope that we can continue to focus on why we are here, which is to try to help. I agree with Jackie Baillie: I do not want to come back to another debate on violence against women; I want to eradicate it. I hope that we can do that.</p><p>We had debates on this topic last month. Jackie Baillie had one, and I had one on Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid&#8217;s 40th anniversary, in which I talked about the work that that organisation does to provide support and refuge for women, children and young people who experience many forms of domestic abuse. The continuing hard work and dedication of organisations such as Women&#8217;s Aid and others mean that people suffering in an abusive relationship feel confident enough to come forward&#8212;that is an important point to remember&#8212;in the knowledge that support is out there.</p><p>I note the Labour amendment. I want to quote Lily Greenan, the manager of Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid&#8212;I hope that Jackie Baillie and the Labour Party are listening. She said:</p><p>&#8220;We expect reported incidents of domestic abuse to continue to rise as the awareness of domestic abuse increases, professionals receive more training and as a result, women are encouraged to report the abuse they are experiencing to police ... We commend the high priority Police Scotland has given to tackling domestic abuse since its establishment in April this year.&#8221;</p><p>I think that we have to listen to the experts on that point.</p><p>It is also worth noting that, as the minister said, funding has increased by more than 60 per cent since 2007 to &#163;34.5 million for the period 2012 to 2015.</p><p>I welcome the proposed strategy, which is aimed at tackling all forms of violence against women. I look forward to the consultation and subsequent publication of the strategy next summer. I am very pleased that female genital mutilation will be part of the project and the consultation.</p><p>It might surprise Margaret Mitchell and the Conservatives to hear this, but I agree with the comments made by the leader of their party, Ruth Davidson, about the number of repeat victims, which continues to stand at around two thirds of reported domestic abuse victims. Members should listen for a minute. The fact that much of that abuse takes place in the home makes it very difficult for the abuser to be brought to justice, which leads to such behaviour being repeated. I think that we all agree that the cycle must be broken, but if we are to tackle the issue effectively, surely we have to look at corroboration, the requirement for which is preventing abusers from going to trial. Most incidents of domestic abuse, rape and violence against women take place behind closed doors with only the two people present. I agree with Ruth Davidson&#8217;s comments and I hope that Margaret Mitchell also agrees with them. If abusers get away with it once, they will get away with it many other times.</p><p>The abolition of corroboration is one of the big measures that will ensure that more of the cases we are talking about can be brought to court and that justice can be seen to be done.</p><p>I note Alison Johnstone&#8217;s amendment, which was not selected.

Indeed, many members have visited such individuals and the families and the groups that look after them and perhaps even those peoples&#8217; families, as Anne McTaggart mentioned. We should all pay tribute to their hard work in looking after and supporting families and those who suffer from substance misuse, particularly as they often do so voluntarily. I hope that members also agree that people who suffer from substance misuse need understanding and support, and that they endorse the expert group&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations while we continue to improve that support.</p><p>Scotland&#8217;s 30 alcohol and drug partnerships are vital in delivering those aims, and I welcome the minister&#8217;s announced consultation with the ADPs on the development of quality principles and, importantly, a strong commitment to human rights.</p><p>It is true that concerns have been expressed that, as Mary Scanlon mentioned, ADPs have not been as transparent as they could be. It is therefore encouraging to see new planning and reporting mechanisms agreed. However, it is also important that they are given the flexibility to develop local strategies as the level of substance misuse and underlying reasons differ widely across Scotland. Indeed, I am sure that members have many different stories to tell about what happens in their constituencies and regions.</p><p>David Liddell, director of the Scottish Drugs Forum, when commenting on the report highlighted the fact that</p><p>&#8220;significant income and health inequalities ... underpin much of Scotland&#8217;s drug problem.&#8221;</p><p>Anne McTaggart also mentioned that matter in her speech.</p><p>In Glasgow, the prevalence of drug misuse is still considerably higher than the national average, which is in part due to the inequalities that exist in that great city and the constituency that I represent. Although tackling the issue may fall outwith the remit of the report, it is important to remember those underlying reasons. I therefore welcome the minister&#8217;s comments on health inequalities and the public health minister&#8217;s involvement in the work. I encourage, if at all possible, joint working with other Scottish Government departments to tackle inequality at all levels.</p><p>The minister mentioned the recovery initiative fund and the unity recovery football club. That is a great example of a local initiative that not only supports recovery, but offers other healthy avenues that give people a new interest and focus. The fact that it also fosters a sense of community among those participating is, to my mind, an important aspect of such projects.</p><p>There are many other projects in Glasgow that take a holistic approach to treatment rather than adopting more mainstream methods. Just like us, which is based in Milton in Glasgow, is another great example. It offers a structured 10-week spiritual-based skills programme that focuses on empowering individuals to take control of their lives in a meaningful way and reduce their reliance on prescribed medication. There are plenty more examples of such an approach not just in Glasgow, but throughout the country. They are important to our overall perception and treatment of substance misuse. Perhaps the minister would look at including that approach in the Government&#8217;s future drugs strategy.</p><p>Another important aspect of support and prevention must be to help people coming out of prison to ensure that they do not simply fall back into substance misuse. Unfortunately, the transition from prison life back into society has seen a number of people go back to past habits, reoffend and be sent back to prison. As a member of the Justice Committee, I know only too well from prisoners&#8217; experiences and the evidence that we have heard that substance misuse is part of the revolving door back to prison. It is very much a vicious cycle that must be ended if we are to avoid further drug misuse.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s public social partnerships have been used in Low Moss prison to tackle that issue and offer the necessary support to individuals after they leave prison. I have an example to share. One user of the partnership said:</p><p>&#8220;There are so many wee things that you need to sort out. Housing, benefits, meds, and add all these wee things together and it feels like an uphill struggle from the start.&#8221;</p><p>After leaving prison, he went to his doctors but he had been deregistered and was told that he would not get what he called his &#8220;subbie&#8221; or, in other words, his prescription, as they had not received a fax from the prison about it. Faced with that, it would have been easy for him to slip back into substance misuse. However, in his case, the PSP spoke to the prison doctor and got the matter sorted out. That is not an isolated incident but, with the support of the PSP, it was much easier for him not to offend again. PSPs have been shown to work. Would the minister consider rolling the model out across Scotland?</p><p>I welcome the independent expert review of opioid replacement therapies in Scotland and the fact that, at its heart, it promotes person-centred recovery. The review also highlights the desire further to develop information, research and evaluation systems at a national level. I encourage the minister to include in that research the use of holistic approaches to drugs misuse and the use of public social partnerships in achieving the aims of the Government&#8217;s drugs strategy.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22768223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Expert Review of Opioid Replacement Therapies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We are all aware of the effects of substance abuse on the individual, those close to them and the wider community.

[Interruption.] Excuse me a minute, but Mr Smith should know that a lot of my constituents and family are affected by the announcement. If he would stop sniping from the sidelines, I could finish what I was saying.</p><p>I do not speak for the trade unions, but I speak for people in my constituency and people outwith it. They are not the only ones who talk to me and others. The Labour Party is not the only party that people go to to express their concerns. On Saturday, I was at a conference at Glasgow Caledonian University at which a debate on independence was held. Out of all the people at the conference, only two&#8212;one of whom was a member of the panel&#8212;said that they would not vote yes in the referendum. All the rest of them said that they would vote yes. Afterwards, we spoke to people individually about the shipyards. A person who works in one of the yards, whom I will meet next week&#8212;I will not give their name, just in case Johann Lamont happens to speak to others&#8212;does not think that it will close. It is not the case that everyone in the yard says that it will close if people vote yes in the referendum. Johann Lamont should not tell me that the Labour Party speaks for every worker in the Clyde shipyards. It does not, and I am sure that others&#8212;both inside and outside the chamber&#8212;will agree with me.</p><p>I was born in Govan and my family&#8212;my father, my brothers and my uncles&#8212;worked in the shipyards. They were vital to the livelihoods of people in the area. Many other families worked in the yards, from Kvaerner to Harland and Wolff to Stephen and Sons to Fairfields, so I know only too well about the heritage of the Govan shipyards. I also know only too well that, as members such as Chic Brodie have said, they have been run down for many years. We should be diversifying and looking to the future. That is what the shipyard workers are telling us.</p><p>When we talk about the here and now, what gets to everyone is the fact that Labour is decrying the skills of the shipyard workers. Instead of supporting those workers, as the Opposition should, Labour is using a red herring and saying to them that if they do not stick by the union or by what Labour tells them, they will lose their jobs. Labour is not saying that they have great skills, that they are fantastic workers and that, if the defence jobs do not come to the Clyde yards, it will do everything that it can to ensure that their skills are used elsewhere. That is what we should be doing. That is why I repeat what I said to Opposition members last week: you should be ashamed of yourselves for constantly scaremongering. It is a disgrace.</p><p>I want to pick up on something that Chic Brodie mentioned: the suggestion that, if we vote for independence, defence work will never come to Scotland. The fact that the MOD is working with Australia on the type 26 frigates has been mentioned.

Nevertheless, I will do my best to give some background information on the reasons for reform and the bill&#8217;s key aims.</p><p>The Tribunals (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 8 May to create the framework for a new structure and organisation for the devolved tribunals in Scotland. Once an act of the Scottish Parliament, it will provide for the establishment of a first-tier tribunal and an upper tribunal for Scotland.</p><p>The policy memorandum explains that devolved tribunals</p><p>&#8220;have been established in an ad hoc fashion, with no common leadership, appointments, practice and procedure or reviews and appeals&#8221;.</p><p>It notes that such a complex and fragmented system can lead to a &#8220;narrowness of outlook&#8221; and variation in standards and performance.</p><p>The bill creates a structure that will reduce overlap, eliminate duplication, ensure better deployment and allow for available resources to be shared more widely, as a number of members have mentioned. It is intended to create a system that will improve the independence&#8212;and the perception of independence&#8212;of the devolved tribunals.</p><p>The policy memorandum overview states that the bill</p><p>&#8220;will create a simple two-tier structure&#8212;a First-tier Tribunal for first instance decisions (into which most tribunal jurisdictions will be transferred) and an Upper Tribunal (where the primary function will be to dispose of appeals from the First-tier)&#8212;-under the leadership of the Lord President of the Court of Session.&#8221;</p><p>All the members who have spoken so far in the debate have welcomed that decision, as has the committee. The bill follows the Philip report and the Scottish Committee of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council&#8217;s 2011 report.</p><p>I turn to some of the issues that the committee raised. We considered the judicial system and the idea of judges being salaried, which has been highlighted by Elaine Murray, Rod Campbell and a number of other members. The committee said that we should look at that issue, and its report states:</p><p>&#8220;The Bill makes no provision for the appointment of full-time salaried judges in any of the tribunals envisaged by the Bill. A number of concerns were therefore raised regarding this perceived gap in the legislation.&#8221;</p><p>The report goes on to note that the minister&#8217;s reply</p><p>&#8220;was not entirely in favour of this suggestion, noting that &#8216;it would be difficult to justify the need for full-time permanent judiciary&#8217; as &#8216;you would be paying salaries to people who would not necessarily be&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>there all the time.</p><p>During the bill process in committee, I noted the knock-on effect for the financial memorandum of that particular recommendation. Perhaps the minister can go into more detail on that issue, because we need to know what effect the committee&#8217;s recommendation for salaried judges for tribunals would have in monetary terms and for the financial memorandum for the bill as a whole.</p><p>The committee recommended that the Government should resolve the delay in</p><p>&#8220;the production of rules for the Upper Tribunal&#8221;</p><p>as a matter of urgency, and a number of members have raised that point today. The committee also recommended that the Scottish Government should set out a definition of a tribunal in the bill in order to protect the character and nature of tribunals. It recommended that, where a tribunal proposes to introduce fees and expenses for the first time,</p><p>&#8220;consultation should be carried out with users and stakeholders of the tribunal&#8221;.</p><p>I concur with the concerns that my fellow member John Pentland raised in that regard, and I think that Alison McInnes also mentioned the issue of fees being charged.</p><p>I note the minister&#8217;s comments on those recommendations and others. They are most welcome, but if she feels that she wants to go into further detail in summing up, that would be welcome too.</p><p>As has been said, a lot of people go to tribunals but do not necessarily go to court. A lot has been said on that&#8212;Nigel Don mentioned that it is part of the legal system and that people who sit on the tribunals perceive them to be part of the judicial system. With regard to the recommendations on people being called judges or judiciary, I think that, as the bill goes through further stages, it will become easier for ordinary members of the public to understand the tribunals system. We are trying to set up a system with no duplication and to give ordinary members of the public who go to tribunals a better understanding and enable them to find out what they are all about so that they get a better service.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22732166", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Tribunals (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Last night I spoke in the second debate this week on women&#8217;s issues and suggested that the debate&#8217;s title should be taken from the popular song, &#8220;Sisters are doin&#8217; it for themselves&#8221;.

Perhaps that should be the title of debates this week.</p><p>I should thank the gentlemen who are here for coming along, too.</p><p>I fully support the motion and congratulate everyone who is involved in the campaign&#8212;members have mentioned various universities and so on. I do not want to repeat what other members have said and lots of things that I wanted to say have already been said. From the speeches, from the work that has been done in the background and from the evidence on the subject, there is no doubt whatever that sexualised images of women&#8212;whether we are talking about pictures of topless women on page 3 and in lads mags or indeed lap dancing and the general portrayal of women and young girls&#8212;objectify women.</p><p>We have talked about Women&#8217;s Aid and the objectification of women and I absolutely take on board what Sarah Boyack said about the problem going far, far deeper than we are led to believe. When I was on holiday I saw the T-shirts that she described on wee kids who were two or three years old, and there are stores on the high street&#8212;I will not say that they are upmarket stores&#8212;that sell bras for kids as young as six or seven. There is something pretty wrong with society if not just women but young girls think that the only way in which they can be successful is by looking like a page 3 model.</p><p>Christian Allard suggested that we should celebrate the activities and achievements of women. Sarah Boyack talked about teaching. Many women here are lawyers and so on. Why can we not celebrate those things in newspapers and magazines and give young women a positive image to look to? The issue lies not just in page 3 but in education. We must educate young women that women are better than that. They are not an object, a body to be looked at by men.</p><p>When I am on the train, subway or bus, and I am sitting next to a man&#8212;or sometimes a woman&#8212;who happens to be reading The Sun, if they turn to page 3 I feel not just embarrassed but angry, because someone might be there with kids, who are also looking at it. What does it say about our society that it is A-okay for somebody to read a newspaper, which is supposed to educate people, in which there is a picture of a topless woman? It says that women are objects. I think that it was Alison Johnstone who said that the women on page 3 tend to be young and white with nice figures. That says to young women that that is the only way in which they can be successful.</p><p>I make a plea to The Sun. It has a real opportunity here: it could be one of the first newspapers in the country to say, &#8220;No more page 3. We&#8217;ve moved beyond that. We&#8217;re in the 21st century and we&#8217;re going to dedicate a page to women&#8217;s achievements.&#8221; That would say something not just to young girls but to women. It would also say to the media industry that we can celebrate women for what they are and what they have achieved and not because they have breasts, can appear on page 3 of a newspaper and look what they might call sexy.</p><p>I would say to the editor of The Scottish Sun, as Jackie Baillie has done, that if he is smart and wants to do something, he should be the first to move things on and take page 3 away. He should celebrate the fact that page 3 is no longer needed and say, &#8220;Here we are, celebrating the achievements of real women. We will give a positive message to young women in this country that they do not have to be topless models to get on in the world.&#8221;</p><p>I congratulate Jackie Baillie once again on securing the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22727976", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: No More Page 3 Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jackie Baillie on securing the debate.

I say 160 people because there were two men there, so 158 women and two men attended that fantastic event.</p><p>The event had lots of things in it, including outreach and breakout participation, and music from SheBoom, which was proud and energising, and from Karine Polwart, with enduring melodies that had a powerful message. There was a wild women writing event, which had spellbinding poetry that was wonderful, inspiring and very moving. There was also a choir at the end of the event. I think that we all went home in great spirits, feeling very positive. I apologise to those whom I unfortunately do not have time to mention, but I thank everyone for their participation in a great day.</p><p>It is amazing to think how far Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid has come since its humble beginnings back in 1973, when the first refuge&#8212;a second-floor flat in the Gorbals&#8212;was handed over to Maura Butterly, a founding member of Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid. From there, weekly meetings took place with the volunteers and the women and children who were staying in the refuge. The next year, the flat next door was added, doubling the capacity, and then in 1975 a house with seven bedrooms was secured. In the same year, a parliamentary inquiry into violence in the family was launched, and that is when the issue of domestic violence became much more mainstream, with recognition that it existed and discussion about how best to tackle it.</p><p>In 1979, in response to a growing demand for information, Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid opened its first office, in the aptly named Hope Street. Now, it runs seven refuges and offers a wide range of other services. It provides information and support, supports children and young people, helps other support organisations, points people in the right direction, provides information on legal, financial and housing rights, and supplies interpreting services. It does fantastic work.</p><p>Last October, Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid and advocacy, support, safety, information services together&#8212;or ASSIST&#8212;launched the children experiencing domestic abuse recovery&#8212;or CEDAR&#8212;programme, which is a therapeutic group work programme that aims to help both women and children to come to terms with the domestic abuse they have experienced or witnessed. That highly innovative approach is, to my mind, a huge success, and I understand that funding has been secured to expand it over the next two years.</p><p>I hope that the Scottish Government will look to and learn from the CEDAR model in its approach to other forms of intervention. As has rightly been said, it is clear that using a multi-agency approach and sharing information and resources is a successful way of working and that better outcomes can be achieved for everyone.</p><p>All that cannot be achieved without the hard work and dedication of the staff. I welcome in particular Angela and Marie from Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid, who are in the public gallery tonight. I extend our heartfelt thanks for all the work that Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid and others do. As Angela has said, their innovative, creative, multi-agency approach helps them to form lasting partnerships.</p><p>Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid relies on donations to provide its services. As little as &#163;5 helps to provide the materials for a child to take part in a children&#8217;s group activity, which helps them to regain confidence and involvement with others, and &#163;10 provides an emergency pack for women who are fleeing domestic abuse. That seems a small amount to us, but it goes a long way. Donations help Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid to provide services for the 5,000 women and children who contact it each year.</p><p>Funding is important for refuge places and outreach work with schools and young children. It is important that young children learn from an early age what domestic abuse is. Prevention is one of the most important things, and I hope that, if we have people in schools talking to young children about domestic abuse, we can prevent it from carrying on from generation to generation. I ask the Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport to update us, if she can, on work that is on-going in that important area, which has been raised with me and Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid on numerous occasions.</p><p>There are issues in the justice system, which I have told Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid I am happy to raise with the Cabinet Secretary for Justice. I do not expect the minister who is here tonight to address this, but there are important questions about, for example, access to children and sheriffs&#8217; interpretations of the justice system. We have to talk about those things. Perhaps I will raise them in the near future while we are looking at the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill. I give the cabinet secretary a heads-up on that.</p><p>We are all aware of the issue of domestic abuse, but we sometimes underestimate its extent. One woman in four will experience domestic abuse at some point in her life, and on average two women per week are killed by a male partner or ex-partner in the United Kingdom. In Scotland, we have, unfortunately, seen a rise in the number of reported cases of domestic abuse. That could be due in part to victims being more willing to come forward. People have said that women feel more confident about coming forward, and I hope that that is why more cases are being reported. I am sure that the support that Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid and others offer is invaluable in ensuring that those who are suffering from abuse feel that they can come forward and report it and that they will be supported.</p><p>More work needs to be done to ensure that, where there is evidence of domestic abuse, the perpetrators are brought to justice. Recently, there has been much discussion in the Parliament about the requirement for corroboration and the need for it to be reformed, with one of the chief reasons being cases of abuse. There are arguments on both sides and the issue is contentious. However, if we are to send out a clear message to those who suffer from domestic abuse and those who perpetrate it, we have to have in place appropriate, accessible mechanisms to secure convictions and reassure victims that they will be protected.</p><p>Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid and others&#8212;I note that Edinburgh Women&#8217;s Aid celebrates its 40th anniversary some time this year&#8212;all do a fantastic job, for which I commend them. I look forward to the day when domestic violence and abuse are no longer tolerated in any society.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724850", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It was a great privilege to secure this debate and it was also a privilege to attend Glasgow Women&#8217;s Aid&#8217;s 40th anniversary celebrations on Friday in St Andrew&#8217;s in the Square in Glasgow, which was attended by 160 people.

This is a very consensual debate. I agree with everything that members have said so far.</p><p>For many years I have spoken about the disclosure system. It has been said that the 1974 act is complicated. Certainly, aspects of it are perceived to be complicated. For example, groups can put forward a disclosure in one person&#8217;s name which can actually cover 12, 15 or even 30 people. We must look closely at that. In one instance, which I will not give details of here, among a group of 30 there were several who had criminal convictions but that was not disclosed because the disclosure was put forward as one action. That has not been raised before but it may come out in the review process.</p><p>Through the Justice Committee I have visited prisons and, of course, we have constituents who come to us. Willie Coffey gave the example of a 20-year-old man or woman who has committed a crime and done their time but, as Mary Fee said, that hangs over their head throughout their life and may affect employment or family matters. We have to consider the disclosure process in the form of rehabilitation.</p><p>I will touch on two parts of the motion. The first is whether the 1974 act needs to be modernised and reformed. At the start of my speech, I said that this has been a very consensual debate and that we all agree that the act has to be modernised and reformed. There is no doubt about that. Christine Grahame said that it does not work properly, is perceived to be complicated and is poorly understood. Employers and ex-offenders do not understand it. That is a huge barrier to the employment of ex-offenders.</p><p>The second part of the motion&#8212;Rod Campbell touched on it&#8212;is that the legislation has a dual role: to protect the public and to help to reduce re-offending. We have to remember that dual role. Mary Fee also said that, in respect of re-offending, we have to consider not only the public but also the press and how it publicises certain issues; that affects all parts of people&#8217;s lives, particularly their families. It is important to remember the dual role for the public and victims, and for those who try to move on.</p><p>The Justice Committee has done a great job. I have not been a member of it for long, perhaps a year. Others have been longer on the committee. It did a great job when it considered the prison estate and how to stop the revolving door, how to stop people reoffending. Maureen Watt, in her contribution, said that there has been success in that respect and that the rate of reoffending is down. That is welcome.</p><p>We have also considered mentoring, which is fantastic. The whole Parliament welcomed that proposal. We have considered community service and community pay-back orders, all of which help to prevent people going to prison. In prison, people sometimes learn new things that will not necessarily help them outside.</p><p>I will touch on the fact&#8212;I think that this is the main point of the motion&#8212;that disclosure can have a devastating effect on people&#8217;s lives. If someone is convicted of a minor crime as a 20-year-old, that can affect their chances of getting a mortgage or insurance three years or six years down the line and it can obviously also affect their chance of getting employment.</p><p>Like other members, I have spoken to many young folk&#8212;either constituents or folk I meet in my role as a member of the Justice Committee&#8212;who are in prison. The one thing that they want to do is to get out and live what they would call a normal life. Having a job and having access to their family prevents people from reoffending. We must consider that issue.</p><p>I congratulate all the parties in the Parliament on having the vision to look at the subject of reoffending and disclosure orders, which are issues that we must touch on. I ask the cabinet secretary whether there is a timescale. Like Rod Campbell, I look forward to the matter coming before the Justice Committee&#8212;Christine Grahame has just come back into the chamber, so she will probably castigate me later on for saying that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697884", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rehabilitation of Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to take interventions.

The perpetrators must be punished and the victims must be protected. I am on the Justice Committee, which is currently considering the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill. It is concerned with putting victims at the heart of the justice system. That bill is still open to amendments at stage 2. I do not want to put the minister on the spot, but perhaps we could think about using amendments to that bill to do something about the abhorrent crime that we are discussing.</p><p>We must recognise that revenge porn is a new form of abuse and is something that we must tackle. We have heard examples of abuses and Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid has included examples in its briefing. There must be nothing more horrifying for someone than to find out that&#8212;sometimes years later, as has been said&#8212;someone with whom they have shared a loving relationship has posted on social media websites images such as the ones that we have been discussing. It must be terrifying and horrifying to see pictures that were taken in, as Christina McKelvie said, a private moment being posted where other people can see them. People do not only put these pictures up on social media websites; they send them in letters and they email them to the individual concerned and to their workmates, as we have heard. They also include personal information such as where the person works, their name, their age and their address. It is horrifying. It must be like being stalked through social media websites.</p><p>That brings me to some of the issues that are raised in Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid&#8217;s handout. Others have talked about the legal remedies, but I would like the minister to clarify the situation with regard to the Communications Act 2003, which I understand to be reserved, not devolved.

Perhaps we can fit an amendment into that act.</p><p>It is important that we support these women and that they are aware of what is happening with the campaign, but it is also important that we do something to protect these women legally.

That seems to be okay for an Opposition party, while the people of Scotland have to do as they are told. That is why I take great umbrage at the Opposition.</p><p>I will make more positive contributions than Opposition members have. I thank the First Minister for his announcements today. He set out a programme for government that was made in the Scottish Parliament for the Scottish people.</p><p>I give a positive welcome for the fact that the Scottish Government is still delivering 1,000 extra police officers. We must remember that police numbers in Scotland are unlike those in England and Wales, where police numbers and salaries are falling catastrophically&#8212;that is all because of the Winsor report. We must remember that we do not have that problem in Scotland.</p><p>I thought that the police figures would be welcomed across the chamber. The Scottish people want a Government and a Parliament that work together for them and welcome positive outcomes, and they want a Parliament that can hold the Government to account when that is required. I do not see a problem with welcoming that. As a back bencher, I uphold that approach and I welcome positive contributions from any member.</p><p>There is much to be welcomed in today&#8217;s statement, such as the community empowerment and renewal bill, which is great. The licensing bill, the housing bill, the ending of automatic early release and many more initiatives are all to be welcomed. It is high time that the Opposition parties put aside their opposition for opposition&#8217;s sake and worked with the Government to deliver what is best for Scotland and its communities.</p><p>Although it is not the only factor, the increase in police numbers has undoubtedly contributed to the lowest level of recorded crime for 37 years. We should all be proud of that. I hope that Opposition members would have the maturity to acknowledge that the legislative programme will go further to reduce crime and make our communities much safer.</p><p>Only last week, the Glasgow Evening Times ran an excellent article on crime in Glasgow. The headlines were staggering. Since 2007, the youth crime rate has almost halved and the number of knife assaults has fallen by 40 per cent&#8212;by the way, Glasgow City Council&#8217;s Labour leader has welcomed that. The reduction has been credited in part to the Scottish Government&#8217;s cashback for communities programme, which &#163;50 million has been put into. We should be proud of that, too. I thank all the people and organisations who have been involved in that not only for making their communities safer but&#8212;what is important&#8212;for empowering people in those communities to realise their potential. We should look towards that.</p><p>I have long championed the community empowerment and renewal bill. I echo Alison Johnstone&#8217;s comments; the bill has fantastic potential and I will follow its progress with great interest.</p><p>Like Mark McDonald, I welcome the licensing bill and in particular a new licensing system for airguns. It is a pity that Johann Lamont, the Labour Party leader, did not even have the decency to mention that important bill.</p><p>I also welcome the inclusion in the licensing bill of a provision to give communities the power to regulate adult entertainment. Some members might recall that I previously tried to introduce a similar provision but, unfortunately, Opposition parties did not support it and voted it down. Perhaps they will support the legislation this time.

Those skills reflected the vital importance of Scotland in Europe at that time and the enduring friendships that we had built up throughout the continent.

I also thank the Health and Sport Committee for its work. I am a member of the Justice Committee, so I did not take part in the Health and Sport Committee&#8217;s investigations, but I was involved with the petition that was lodged when I was a member of the Public Petitions Committee. I am pleased that things have moved so far, and I congratulate Duncan McNeil on his speech, which I must say was wonderful.</p><p>The bill aims to improve support for victims and witnesses as they encounter and move through the criminal justice system. That is to be welcomed. As the Justice Committee said on page 5 of its report, under the heading &#8220;Background to the Bill&#8221;, improvements in support have been happening</p><p>&#8220;against the backdrop of a growing public perception that the balance of rights is tipping in favour of the accused.&#8221;</p><p>That is why we need the bill and why it is so important that we talk about victims and witnesses.</p><p>Many people might think that the perception is not correct, but the evidence that we received certainly suggested that the public and witnesses need to be made more aware of court proceedings, enabled to have more involvement with key stakeholders and given access to information, support and protection. Above all, people need to be treated with respect. Many people who gave evidence felt that they did not receive such a service from the justice system.</p><p>The bill covers many areas, but I will concentrate on a couple of issues, because time is short. Much has been made of the definition of &#8220;victim&#8221;. Everyone who has spoken in the debate has used that word, and I remember that at one of our many committee meetings&#8212;I am sure that other members of the committee remember it, too&#8212;a lot of time was taken up debating the term and whether we should talk about a victim or a complainer.</p><p>I can only repeat what I said at the committee. If a crime is committed against me, I am a victim and not a complainer. I note&#8212;Jenny Marra raised this when I asked a question&#8212;that the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 uses the word &#8220;complainer&#8221;. However, most members of the public are not lawyers and, if a crime is committed against them, they are victims. That is why the bill is called the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill. I draw members&#8217; attention to that. I am pleased that the committee&#8217;s recommendation recognises that, and I take on board the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments and the clarity in that area.</p><p>Most people know that it is not just the victims of crime who are affected but their families and loved ones. I know that my colleague Willie Coffey will highlight that again. I have made the point about using the word &#8220;victim&#8221; rather than &#8220;complainer&#8221; more than once because, as I said, we discussed it for a long time&#8212;probably longer than any other aspect of the bill&#8212;and, given the time that that took, I am concerned about how long it would take to discuss a definition to be put in the bill.</p><p>I welcome the measures&#8212;particularly live television links and the use of screens and supporters&#8212;that are being taken to protect vulnerable witnesses and encourage them to take part in court procedures. I particularly welcome the inclusion of victims of sexual offences, domestic abuse, human trafficking and stalking, which will ensure that they are automatically entitled to use standard special measures when giving evidence. I ask the cabinet secretary whether he is minded to extend the powers in the bill&#8212;or will consider doing that&#8212;to include further measures to protect victims of human trafficking and particularly children who have been trafficked.</p><p>Jenny Marra and others have mentioned the letter from the victims organisation collaboration forum Scotland and Scotland&#8217;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, their objection to the provision that both parties have the right to object to special measures being used when evidence is given and their call for the removal of sections 9 and 13. I take on board what they say, but I believe that a balance has to be struck. Vulnerable witnesses should be and will be identified early and, if special measures are needed, they should and will be explained to witnesses as early as possible. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments on that issue in his speech.</p><p>I look forward to processing the bill through the Parliament. It has many good provisions. We have heard about them and we will hear more later. We will also hear concerns that other members raise. That is how it should be in debates, particularly at stage 1. The bill&#8217;s overall principle is to ensure that victims and witnesses receive support and feel able to participate in the justice system. The bill will give them that opportunity and enable them to do so.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22694151", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

I know how much work he has done with the credit unions. In a previous life, before becoming an MSP, I used to go to Ladywell, which is in my constituency, to ask John Wilson and others for advice on debt matters. Given that I know John Wilson from the Scottish Low Pay Unit, I am not surprised that he is pushing forward credit union issues.</p><p>I congratulate, too, ABCUL on winning the contract, which will enable credit unions throughout the country to expand, which is very important.</p><p>I admire Kezia Dugdale: her speech touched all the right issues and was delivered very well.</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary to say in his closing speech what the Government and the Parliament can do, not just to expand credit unions&#8212;they are very good at expanding themselves, as we will certainly see with the new contract&#8212;but to make more people, both outside and here in the Parliament, aware that credit unions exist. I know that there is a credit union here, but many people do not know about the credit union system. They may think that credit unions are only for people who do not earn a sufficient amount, so it is important that we get the message across that we can all benefit from credit unions by saving and putting money in.</p><p>I want to give a wee bit of background to credit unions. I remember that my dad, many years ago, belonged to a credit union and was able to save money and get money out at reasonable rates, without being ripped off by companies such as Wonga. I always admired credit unions for being financial co-operatives, owned by their members and operating under common bond criteria. Profits are distributed to members through dividends and members have a say in how the union is run. Credit unions are grassroots operations that are for the people and benefit the people.</p><p>It is not just about saving money and being able to get money back; it is also about training. Lots of people who began as savers in credit unions wanted to get involved in the voluntary aspect and were given training by their credit union on finance, budgets and financial management. That was a great tool for them, and some of them went on to get employment as a result. I admire that aspect of credit unions very much.</p><p>Glasgow Credit Union has been mentioned already and will probably be mentioned again. It was founded in 1989 for the employees of what was then Glasgow District Council, and has expanded greatly since then. Thirty thousand people are members of Glasgow Credit Union, and this year it became the first credit union to reach &#163;100 million in assets. That is a lot of money for a credit union&#8212;money that is helping all the people who have put money in the union, trained in it and learned from it.</p><p>Although it is called the Glasgow Credit Union, it is larger than some United Kingdom-wide building societies, which shows the greatness of credit unions. Regardless of what happens, I want to make a point about advertising credit unions: it is important that everyone is made aware of them. I also think that is rather crass of Danny Alexander to scaremonger by sending out press releases that say that credit unions would not be viable if there was a yes vote for an independent Scotland.

I know only too well how difficult it is for asylum seekers&#8212;for the adults, never mind the children&#8212;to work their way through and understand the system. A different approach was needed then and is definitely needed now; we need to look at that.</p><p>In my work, I was involved with a group, supported by Glasgow City Council social work department, that worked with unaccompanied asylum seekers. The concern about age always raised its head when I visited the groups and the children. I see that we have young people in the public gallery today; they have been listening very intently. For them and also for others I want to give a small case study of one of those disputes about age.</p><p>The study concerns Abdul, who arrived in the UK in 2011 and was referred to the service in June. Abdul believes that he is 14 years old; indeed, he was told his date of birth by his mother. However, when he came here he was assessed as being 16 years old, which caused numerous problems. The dispute about Abdul&#8217;s age meant that he was unable to attend school; he was told to attend college. Obviously, Abdul wanted to be with children of his own age and he refused to go to college. As a consequence, he has become socially isolated and increasingly withdrawn and his mental health has deteriorated.</p><p>As I said, I give that example because we have children and young adults in the public gallery today. Some of those young adults may be voting next year. They have the freedom to do that; yet here in our country we have unaccompanied young adults, trafficked from whatever source, who do not have the opportunity to have a say&#8212;or would not have if we did not have the unique Scottish guardianship service.</p><p>The Scottish guardianship service is, indeed, a unique partnership between Aberlour and the Scottish Refugee Council. It is funded by the Scottish Government, and I welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement of an extra three years of funding. It is also supported by many charities, including Barnardo&#8217;s. Like other members, I thank everyone who is involved.</p><p>The project was set up and developed with young people and for young people. It is little wonder that the UK Parliament&#8217;s Joint Committee on Human Rights has recommended that the UK Government should commission similar pilots in England and Wales with a view to establishing a wider system of guardianship. I hope that the minister will monitor whether that goes ahead and report back to us on whether the UK Government accepts that recommendation and looks at such a project, which would add to what we are doing in Scotland.</p><p>I thank Professor Crawley and Professor Ravi Kohli for their independent evaluation of the service. Annabelle Ewing mentioned some aspects of that. They found that the guardians advocate for all decisions by professionals to be taken in the best interests of the child, and that guardianship has worked within the principles of getting it right for every child. That is an important point, and it perhaps answers some of Neil Bibby&#8217;s questions about how we go forward with the service. Using the premise of getting it right for every child for unaccompanied children is a good start.</p><p>The evaluation also found that guardianship has lifted the overall quality of service provision by encouraging professionals such as legal representatives, social workers and residential staff to work together more closely, and it demonstrates the advantages for young people when they do that.</p><p>As I said, it is difficult for adults to cope with the asylum process, so we can only imagine what it is like for a child. Having guardians there to go through every single step with them gives them support and builds up not only their confidence but their capability to take on the things that are happening in their lives.</p><p>I am pleased that this fantastic service will operate for another three years. I would like it to be monitored, with more reporting back. However, we cannot have a debate on asylum and immigration without mentioning the UK Border Agency. I see that Liam McArthur has left the chamber, but I believe it is really important that we, as representatives of our constituents, have the same right as MPs at Westminster to contact the UK Border Agency and the Foreign Office. I have contacted the Red Cross, which is a fantastic organisation that can find the birth parents of unaccompanied asylum seekers back in the Congo or wherever it may be. It does not ask whether we are an MP or an MSP. If we have an interest, such as a constituent who is looking for their long-lost child, it will do that work for us.</p><p>I know that the minister will speak to the Minister for External Affairs and International Development, and I plead with the Government to speak to the UK Government once again. We can do what we can, but we desperately need the same powers that MPs have to find out, on behalf of constituents, exactly what is happening in the asylum system.</p><p>We have talked about unaccompanied children, but we also have young children who are with families who are seeking asylum in our country. I ask the minister whether there is anything that we can do to make their lives better. Can we extend the project to include the children of those families? Can we prevent them from having to go down to Brand Street in Glasgow to have their fingerprints taken just in case they are not the children they say they are? They are taken out of schools and away from doctors appointments.</p><p>I see that the Presiding Officer is asking me to wind up.

She worked long and hard to ensure that chronic pain was at the top of the agenda, so I thank her along with all the others who have worked tirelessly to bring the matter forward.</p><p>I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s announcement of the provision of residential accommodation and look forward to other ideas coming forward. I was taken by Fiona McLeod&#8217;s interesting suggestion of using the homoeopathic hospital. As one of quite a few MSPs who brought the plight of the homoeopathic hospital to the Parliament when it was under threat of closure and who worked with MSPs from all parties to debate the issue, I think that Fiona McLeod&#8217;s idea is a good one. It is a fantastic building on a fantastic site that is very easy to reach. It is in a good setting and offers fantastic treatments. A number of members may have visited the homoeopathic hospital. It has a relaxing feel about it and, as Fiona McLeod said, it has won awards. I would be interested in exploring that idea, and the homoeopathic hospital may support it in the consultation.</p><p>The cabinet secretary talked about integration, clinical networks, health boards and the creation of action plans by the health boards to improve the services that are available locally. Every one of us would agree that it is imperative that we have not just joined-up thinking but joined-up working. All the services must have that in order to ensure that the services that people suffering from chronic pain get are the very best. We have heard from practically every member who has spoken in the debate, regardless of their party, that the service that is provided by health boards is patchy in the extreme. My health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, seems to offer one of the best services, but in other areas people are not getting the service that they deserve. It is therefore important&#8212;as, I am sure, the cabinet secretary and the minister will take on board&#8212;to monitor the health boards to ensure that they produce plans. If they do not work together, the system will not work at all.</p><p>The service that local community pharmacies deliver has been mentioned on numerous occasions. In Glasgow Kelvin, they provide an invaluable outreach service. I ask the minister to say, in his summing up, exactly what role community pharmacies will play in the Government&#8217;s plans. Will their role be enhanced? Will they be involved in the consultation that is going out to patients and so on? What exactly will they be doing? I am sure that community pharmacies would also like to know that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692372", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I pay tribute to the many campaigners who have worked tirelessly to ensure that chronic pain is at the top of the agenda.

As Ruth Davidson said, regardless of politics, we should all stand together to commemorate and celebrate the strong women in our society.</p><p>The theme of strong and inspirational women runs through the debate. I know that Mary Barbour and the Independent Labour Party have inspired other members, but if members will indulge me, I will say who in my party my inspiration came from. Wendy Wood was my inspiration. She was probably not the most popular person, as she incurred the wrath of both Westminster and her own party, which was called the Scottish National Movement at the time. I am not saying that I am deliberately like Wendy Wood, but I admire her stance on many things.</p><p>I will mention two wee snippets of Wendy&#8217;s life. She had two spells in prison. Her first was in Saughton prison in Edinburgh after she attempted to disrupt a meeting of the Blackshirts at the Mound in Edinburgh and was arrested for a breach of the peace. Her second spell in prison came because she demonstrated against the conditions in women&#8217;s prisons in Scotland, and she was imprisoned for that. Once she left prison, she set to work on the prison commissioners and eventually got a letter saying that Duke Street prison was to be demolished and a new women&#8217;s prison was to be built at Greenock.</p><p>I was inspired by Wendy Wood as well as by Mary Barbour and what I was told by my aunt. We have had great women in our society, but do we honour them properly? I do not think so. At this point, I depart from what Ruth Davidson said as she called for a monument or statue in George Square. As I am a Govanite, I think that members will expect me to look for some form of monument in Govan. It does not have to be in Elder park, but it should be somewhere in the area where the whole thing started. For me, that would be an appropriate commemoration. It will be up to Maria Fyfe and others in the working party to decide where it will go, but as a Govanite I would like to see something in the Govan area to commemorate Mary Barbour and those many other women.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692086", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mary Barbour Commemoration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Anne McTaggart on securing the debate.

I congratulate Mary Fee on securing this debate. I know that she has a special interest in the issue and I pay tribute to her tenacity.</p><p>As I mentioned in last week&#8217;s debate, reoffending and rehabilitation are something that I, too, feel very passionately about. Mary Fee mentioned the throughcare service being piloted at Greenock prison. That is, indeed, a fantastically innovative project. I would like to quote from a meeting at which Mary Fee was also present, where the prison services said:</p><p>&#8220;It is widely recognised that offenders frequently find it difficult to successfully return to their communities and avoid reoffending when released from prison. The SPS is continually exploring ways to additionally support prisoners after their liberation, for the benefit of both offenders and the communities which they return to.&#8221;</p><p>That is very important: it is not just the prisoners but their communities and society as a whole who benefit from these fantastic, innovative ideas. The goal of HMP Greenock is to sustain the unique relationship between prison officers and prisoners, an important subject that I also raised in last week&#8217;s debate. I believe that they know each other best. That is what is stated in the innovative project&#8212;that prison officers get involved in the attempt to build the lives of prisoners when they are released into their communities. I am delighted that a number of the agencies mentioned by Mary Fee, in both the Government and the third sector, are working together on this fantastic project.</p><p>Mary Fee mentioned the mentoring service, which is something that I also feel passionately about. To tackle reoffending, &#163;7.7 million has been spent on a network of mentoring schemes throughout the country. I want to give an example from one of the projects, called Includem, in my own area of greater Glasgow. I will not give any personal details; just a couple of soundbites about what has happened.</p><p>This story is about a chap called Andrew and how for many years he had been in and out of prison, almost as though there were a revolving door. The first thing he said was,</p><p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t had Includem, I&#8217;d probably still be fighting and picking up charges.&#8221;</p><p>Andrew came from the sort of situation that Mary Fee has just described. I will not call his background dysfunctional, but he had a home life that was not the norm as we would probably see it, and his family relationships really suffered because of that and the young man got involved in gangs and alcohol and was on the wrong side of the fence and the law&#8212;whatever we would want to call it. Once he was in prison again, Includem became involved and involved him in a mentoring scheme. Since he has been released from prison, he has had no further charges; he has been in no trouble at all. His family have all been helped to get on with their lives. Andrew says now that he is really looking forward to the future.</p><p>We in this Parliament should be proud of the introduction of those innovative types of rehabilitation. As I have said on many occasions, we can lock everyone up, but it is no good for them or for society outwith.</p><p>I thank Mary Fee for lodging her motion and I congratulate her on her first members&#8217; business debate, which is very worthy. I hope that we can all work together, no matter what our political party. This is not about parties; it is about making sure that young people and others have a life when they come out of prison and that communities benefit from that life.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690657", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Reducing Reoffending (Prisoners&#8217; Assets)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

I take on board what everyone has said, but the more we discuss the community justice system, the better it is all round. I am sure that we will come back to a fuller debate.</p><p>I say that not only because I am a member of the Justice Committee but because I believe passionately in delivering a justice system that serves all the community and delivers a better outcome for victims, communities and offenders. It must also deliver positive outcomes for all, because that is what we are in the Parliament to do. It is difficult when we go out to communities and listen to the victims&#8217; stories, but it is also difficult when we go into prison and speak to prisoners who have experienced the revolving-door system and had a chaotic lifestyle, perhaps even from childhood.</p><p>It is important that we debate the redesign of the community justice system. It will be better for everyone in society, not only in our local communities.</p><p>A number of people mentioned the three options for the CJAs. Members will probably be glad to know that I will not mention those, but I will make a small point about CJAs. Perhaps it is a failing on my part&#8212;I really do not know&#8212;but I have never had any contact with my local CJA. No one from it has contacted me, and I could not tell anyone who the members are. Perhaps, if some other members tell me their experience of CJAs, I will be able to understand the options better. I am sure that we will get further into that.</p><p>I will raise two areas that a number of members have mentioned: throughcare and delivery, and mentoring.</p><p>Like other members of the Justice Committee, I recently went on a visit. I visited Barlinnie prison in Glasgow and, when I spoke to the officers, agencies and prisoners, one thing came through clearly: the need for joined-up thinking and throughcare in relation to housing&#8212;which has been raised before&#8212;health and financial support. The prisoners I spoke to told me that, although they were visited by agencies that could provide housing, they received no advice about housing until they were released. When they turned up, there was no housing for them and they had to go into hostels. As Graeme Pearson mentioned, in some cases they were given sleeping bags. The prisoners told us that they did not want to go into the hostels because that would mean that they were going back into a life of crime and would have to sleep on the streets.</p><p>That must be looked at. I hope that the redesign of the community justice system will examine that in particular. I hope that it will also consider the simple matter of what time people get out of prison and how they can access social work and finance. It became clear that, although there are a number of agencies that do a fantastic job, they do not seem to meet together. There is a desperate need to look at the number of agencies, the services that they provide and whether there is joined-up thinking in throughcare.</p><p>The cabinet secretary mentioned the &#163;7.7 million that has been given to extend the mentoring system. I am a great supporter of mentoring, as I have said in the chamber before. In particular, the extension of using prison staff and peer groups to mentor prisoners is a fantastic idea. That system provides support to vulnerable prisoners who lead chaotic lifestyles. It is not only about the prisoners but about the communities into which they are released and their families. Everyone in the Parliament should be extremely proud of the mentoring system and the fact that we are moving it on and delivering more.</p><p>Much has been said about reoffending. I take that on board, but we must also take on board the fact that progress has been made on tackling reoffending. The reoffending rates are at their lowest for more than a decade. Graeme Pearson mentioned the figures for 1999, which is more than 10 years ago. Recorded crime is also at a 37-year low.</p><p>We must also consider the fact that community payback orders, which members have mentioned, have been successfully implemented. Between April 2011 and March 2012, 10,228 orders were commenced. Although I realise that the system must be looked at, the whole-system approach for young people continues to be rolled out throughout Scotland, resulting in a decrease in the number of recorded crimes and offences committed by young people. There are positives, but we have to do something to move forward.</p><p>I think that we all agree that there is a revolving-door system and that, although progress has been made, we need to do something to stop that. As I said, I am pleased to speak in the debate, and I believe that the outcome of the consultation will go some way towards achieving proper community justice and stopping the revolving-door system, which is a blight not just on individuals but on entire communities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690163", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Community Justice System"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps I am the only one&#8212;I do not know&#8212;but I am pleased to speak in the debate.

As John Mason said, some kids that we took on the play scheme had never been on the subway and had never been on a train. I will not tell members exactly what happened when I got them to Kelvingrove art gallery and they saw the fountain there with the money in it; members can imagine what they tried to do. Those kids had never been outside that small place that they were born and brought up in.</p><p>When I was talking to Liz Buchanan and others at the meeting this afternoon, in particular some of the teachers from Sandaig primary, I was reminded of the fact that in some inner cities&#8212;in particular in Glasgow, but it probably happens all over&#8212;there is a territorial issue. Kids will not cross the road to go to another area, so therefore they perhaps do not see the sea or the grass because they are confined to that particular area. It is rather sad.</p><p>This holiday idea gets the kids completely out of such areas, and some of the examples that have been produced show how good it has been for the kids to be able to break away from what happens in their lives&#8212;the poverty, domestic violence in some cases, and other issues; for example, when someone in the family has passed away. It is absolutely fantastic to be able to offer&#8212;not just to the kids, but to their families&#8212;the opportunity to get away for a complete break.</p><p>Mary Scanlon and other members mentioned that such breaks help with mental health, which they do.

In addition to the recommendations that Mary Scanlon highlighted, I want to mention first the recommendation on the European Commission&#8217;s Calypso programme on social tourism. We are told that participation in the programme costs nothing, so I hope that the minister can look at that. As John Mason and others said, social tourism can help to boost the economy because it puts money into the economy and because those who work in the sector can be employed for longer. We should also remember&#8212;in case anyone from the press takes the wrong idea&#8212;that the proposal is about giving people holidays in their own country and not abroad, which makes it even better.</p><p>Secondly, given the recommendation about providing disadvantaged families with free tickets for venues in the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, perhaps the minister could speak to his colleague Shona Robison on whether we could do something like that for the Commonwealth games. That could kick-start this idea of social holidays.</p><p>Again, I am grateful to John Mason for bringing the issue to the attention of the Parliament.

Let us look at the numbers. The number of summary complaints registered at the sheriff courts has declined from more than 8,000 per month to less than 6,000 per month. The number of summary complaints registered at the sheriff and JP courts together has shown a continual and consistent decline. The number of High Court indictments registered has declined from just under 90 per month to just over 60 per month. Margaret Mitchell will admit that there is, perhaps, room for manoeuvre and, when we see the evidence, improvement.</p><p>One recommendation concerns using information technology to make the experience more effective. We all know of the huge advances that we have made in recent years and the opportunity that those advances present. A few years ago, not only I but other members would never have imagined that we would be able to talk directly to somebody in, for example, Malawi. In certain circumstances, as the convener of the cross-party group on Palestine, I have had videolinks with people in the West Bank, have been able to ask them questions and have heard them answer.</p><p>Every one of us would admit that we can develop such technology in the Court Service. Of course we must ensure that it is used only in specific areas of the Court Service, but we should certainly be looking into it. I think that it would benefit absolutely everyone.</p><p>Among the responses to the initial consultation, there was a very positive response to the increase in the use of technology, particularly in relation to the administrative side of things and the registration of cases. There was also a positive response to the idea of allowing certain court appearances to be made by live videolink.</p><p>As part of the Scottish Government&#8217;s making justice work programme in the north of Scotland, work is nearing completion on the introduction of a new secure live-link videoconferencing network covering six northern courts and four other locations. Very importantly for the justice system, that will give criminal justice organisations the opportunity to use the technology for some cases, instead of participants having to travel to court. Members would all agree that those are positive possibilities, which we should embrace.</p><p>As I said, we all recognise the need for reform. We all certainly recognise that the UK Government is making huge cuts in Scotland. We all have a responsibility to spell out how we will deal with them.</p><p>With that in mind, I must admit to being slightly confused by the Labour Party&#8217;s motion. It appears that Labour recognises the need for reform, and the motion highlights Labour&#8217;s opposition to the closure of some courts, but does that mean that it recognises the need to close the courts that the motion does not mention? That seems a wee bit odd. Perhaps the mover of the motion would like to take the opportunity to clarify the position&#8212;or perhaps not. I cannot thank Lewis Macdonald for any clarification; if he does not wish to intervene, he can perhaps ensure that the point is dealt with in the closing speech.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689343", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When we look at the results of the elections, it seems that the people of Scotland trust the Scottish National Party, rather than the Labour Party.

I remember a speech that the late, great Margaret Ewing MSP&#8212;not Margaret Thatcher&#8212;who did an awful lot of work on tackling violence against women, gave when she came back from the Congo. She said that she had spoken to women who had been raped in every orifice. The shock and the horror of hearing her say that has never left me. Rape is still being used as a weapon of war, with atrocities being committed against not just women but young children. There should be a special sentence for anyone who uses rape as a weapon of war.</p><p>It is important that we keep our eye on international events while we, in the Scottish Parliament, are tackling certain issues of violence against women. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities paper &#8220;Safer Lives: Changed Lives: A Shared Approach to Tackling Violence Against Women in Scotland&#8221; sets out all the things that the Parliament has done to tackle violence against women and domestic abuse. Those include establishing the domestic abuse task force, setting up domestic abuse courts, considering the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Bill, which we are doing just now, and addressing the issue of corroboration particularly in relation to sexual offences, which is still to come. Yes, we should be proud of those things, but there are lots of other things that we can do.</p><p>Like everyone else here, I am very interested in tackling the sexual exploitation of women. I have never appeared on page 3 of certain newspapers, but I have certainly been slated in many of those newspapers because of my stance&#8212;which is shared by others&#8212;against sexual exploitation in the many forms that it takes. We have heard about the need to address the educational opportunities for young girls and their belief that, if they say no to a young boy when they are a teenager, they deserve a slap in the face. That was a horrific report.</p><p>Sexual exploitation takes many forms, including the words of the music that is aimed at young girls. We see girls as young as five, four or even three&#8212;toddlers&#8212;gyrating about a stage and people think that it is fine because they are in one of those dance classes, but it is actually sexual exploitation of kids as young as three, four and five. We also see the clothes&#8212;I will not name the stores that sell them&#8212;with terrible slogans across the front. Not long ago, I saw a wee five-year-old wearing a tiny T-shirt that said &#8220;I am a mini WAG&#8221; on it. We have had bras and pants for kids as young as four and five being sold in shops. That is sexual exploitation. What can be done about that? People must be educated.</p><p>I know that many members have tried to take action. I proposed legislation on the licensing and control of adult entertainment venues, including lap dancing venues. Unfortunately, the legislation was not passed, because certain parties voted it down. I appeal to them to support my new member&#8217;s bill when it is introduced.</p><p>We must ensure that we tackle the sexual exploitation of young girls and the horrific crimes that are a consequence of that and the fact that women are looked on as sexual objects and not human beings. We must do everything in our power in this Parliament&#8212;and throughout the world&#8212;to ensure that women are treated as equals to everyone else on the planet.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688727", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: One Billion Rising Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Kezia Dugdale on her first members&#8217; business debate on such an emotive subject.

We know that increasing the number of people who live healthy lifestyles would cut that number and prevent bowel cancer. I know that some of my colleagues will use and speak about the facts and figures, but I want to keep my remarks to the bowel cancer&#8212;don&#8217;t take a chance, take the test screening, as this is a fantastic opportunity to bring that to the fore.</p><p>I attended the launch of the campaign at the Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow. The Scottish Government launched it as part of the detect cancer early programme, which is backed by NHS 24 and the Scottish cancer coalition.</p><p>It is true to say that the campaign has certainly raised some eyebrows. It features Ford Kiernan in a very visual situation on television and in a very good voiceover on the radio, and it does not leave a lot to the imagination. I am sure that members have seen it. I think it is absolutely brilliant. Some people have said that it is designed to shock, but certainly it brings to people&#8217;s attention exactly what bowel cancer is.</p><p>The campaign&#8217;s aim is to bring home bowel cancer, particularly to men and particularly to men on the west coast. As we know, men find it particularly difficult to talk about their health and certain illnesses. In the case of bowel cancer, many men do not just find it difficult to talk about it but are very embarrassed and would not take the time to go to the doctor.</p><p>Bowel cancer is the third most common form of cancer in men, so anything that makes people sit up, take notice and take the test can only be a good thing. When we announced the campaign and that I was going to lodge a motion on it, it was obvious that some people who had seen the video were quite embarrassed and shocked by it. However, as I said, I thought it was brilliant. If it makes people sit up and take notice, it is a very good thing.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I had a conversation with Jackson Carlaw about the test. A number of us in Parliament will have received the test and not used it, set it aside or put it in the bin. I am not saying that Jackson Carlaw did that, but we did have a conversation about it.</p><p>The test kit is aimed at 50 to 74-year-olds and I appeal to people: when the kit lands on their doorstep, they should please take the test. It comes through the door every two years, it is very effective and simple to use, and the diagnosis is excellent. People can start treatment if bowel cancer is caught early enough, and if people do not have signs of bowel cancer but are worried about it, those worries could be completely gone after taking the test. That plea is the reason why I lodged the motion&#8212;I am sorry about the pun. People have to take the test because it can save so many lives.</p><p>It is really important that bowel cancer should be caught early. With early detection, nine out of 10 people can survive bowel cancer. As the motion says, Glasgow has the highest rate of bowel cancer deaths in Scotland, so it is imperative that people take part in the screening initiative. I thank Beating Bowel Cancer, Bowel Cancer UK and Cancer Research UK for their work and the magnificent job that they have done of highlighting the issue.</p><p>At the launch at the CCA, I met Lynn Faulds Wood, a broadcaster whom many people know. She is Scottish but now works and lives in London and she is a survivor of bowel cancer, which she had in her early 20s. Not only older people get bowel cancer. Lynn is such a good ambassador for this campaign; she speaks very highly of the people who have worked on it and says how important it is that people take part in it.</p><p>I also spoke to other survivors and people who are receiving treatment. They are very positive in their outlook, while recognising the real challenges that lie ahead. I will not name the person, but not so long ago I lost a very dear friend and colleague to bowel cancer. Six weeks before he was diagnosed, he had been playing squash, running and leafleting up and down tenements in Glasgow. If he had thought about taking the test, he might still have been with us here today. There are many other examples.</p><p>The message that I want people to take out of the debate is that bowel cancer is treatable if caught early enough. Help is there: there is a website and a hotline that people can phone if they happen to have thrown their kit in the bin. I make a plea, particularly to men who think that they do not need to take the test because bowel cancer will not happen to them and who would be embarrassed to talk about it: they should listen to the radio campaign, watch the video on TV and take the test. If nine out of 10 people survive a positive diagnosis, one of those nine could be any of them.</p><p>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to debate the motion, Presiding Officer.

What I really like and admire about the organisation is the fact that it is very much a grass-roots organisation that is built from the bottom up and that listens to the people at the coalface, not necessarily the professionals who receive from the coalface. It mentions various issues to do with carers&#8217; experiences, which the organisation knows about from people writing back to it. It says that there needs to be greater understanding, particularly among professionals, of the national dementia strategy and the right to dignity and respect&#8212;an issue that Fiona McLeod raised. As she said, when someone is caring for a person with dementia it is difficult for them to get through the maze of paperwork and bureaucracy to find exactly what is right for them. The national dementia strategy offers that, but we need to push it out more to professionals, who are the ones that we need to speak to and tackle.</p><p>Mark McDonald talked about the amounts of money that carers receive each week through their benefits. As Claire Baker and others have said, it is not about the money, but if someone has a family with a couple of kids and they have to give up their job, they need something to support them&#8212;particularly with the increase in utility bills&#8212;and &#163;58.45 is not a lot of money. In some cases, people cannot take another job. I know that, unfortunately, benefits are outwith the scope of the Scottish Parliament, but we need to look at that situation.</p><p>I am the convener of the cross-party group on older people, age and ageing&#8212;Nanette Milne is the deputy convener, as Jim Hume was&#8212;and dementia has been raised on many occasions within the group. There are many fantastic organisations and individuals out there, including Alzheimer Scotland and Tommy Whitelaw, who give their all to ensure that people who have dementia are put to the forefront. We always look forward to someone coming along to give us advice on the best way forward.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is a fantastic opportunity to hear about individual cases. We did not realise that my mum had dementia until my dad died and, when we went to visit her, we found that the sink was overflowing, the pot was burned and the gas was left on. Similar to the case of Jim Hume&#8217;s parents, my dad had protected my mum from anyone knowing that she had dementia. Fortunately, as we are a big family, someone was able to stay with her every night&#8212;that is not the case for everyone&#8212;until she became so ill that she could not stay in her own home and, unfortunately, we had to put her into a care home. Such personal experiences, which come through the carers&#8217; voices, mean so much; it is about the grass roots and the people who have suffered.</p><p>We talk about suffering but, as Nanette Milne said, there are sometimes humorous moments or moments of great joy when the sufferers hear music that they remember or when they see kids, as Mark McDonald said. In my mother&#8217;s case, such moments were when she saw her grandkids and great-grandkids. However, at times, she thought that I was her sister and said that I was not to go out because I was bad or something like that&#8212;obviously, my auntie had done something wrong in her past life. For us, that time was joyful as well as sometimes sad.</p><p>I commend what is being done, which we have heard about in the debate.

It might take time to create a society that looks beyond economics, but issues such as those that we are discussing show clearly that we need to explore how to tackle such matters from a wider viewpoint than that of whether we can afford a particular approach.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685474", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Demographic change and an ageing population&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest as the convener of the cross-party group on older people, age and ageing.

The IMF&#8217;s view seems to be that we should not celebrate the fact that people are living longer, but those people contribute to society economically and in other ways. That is why we must adopt a different approach and take a wider viewpoint.</p><p>As the Finance Committee recognised, older people make a huge contribution to society, and not just economically&#8212;they benefit the people around them and the wider community. Many of those benefits might not be easy for an economist to quantify, but they are an essential aspect of a vibrant society.</p><p>Some have shone the political spotlight on provision such as free personal care and free travel entitlement, but in my opinion they have done so without giving proper thought to the positive impact that such policies have on older people and wider society. When those policies are discussed, mention tends not to be made of the elephant in the room&#8212;I am not referring to anyone in the chamber, but to the powers that we in Scotland need but do not have. Age Scotland&#8217;s document &#8220;Older People, Public Policy and the Impact of Devolution in Scotland&#8221; noted that a number of key policy levers that impact on older people, such as those to do with pensions, benefits and taxation, are still reserved to the UK Parliament. It concludes that, as a result, there are obvious limits on the Scottish Government&#8217;s capacity to develop an integrated policy approach. I think that that lack of real powers is hindering rather than helping our ability to tackle demographic change and other issues.</p><p>I pay credit to the Labour Party under the leadership of Henry McLeish, which did not buckle under the pressure from Westminster not to introduce free personal care, even when the UK Department for Work and Pensions disagreed that we should be able to rely on the continued payment of attendance allowance. As I mentioned to Jamie Hepburn, that added significantly to the cost of implementing free personal care. At the time&#8212;nearly 12 years ago&#8212;the cost of free personal care was &#163;40&#160;million per year. I believe that it has now gone up to &#163;60&#160;million per year. That equates to &#163;500&#160;million denied to our budget for older people. In the debate, we must acknowledge that, if we are to face the challenges that lie ahead, we need to have real powers to tackle them. It is no use simply attacking steps that have been taken without acknowledging what steps could be taken. That is an extremely important point.</p><p>That is not to say that we should not make every effort to come to terms with the issues that confront us. As the committee notes in the report&#8217;s conclusions, the Scottish Government and the main public services are doing a great deal of work to address some of the challenges that we face. The committee makes an important point about that work&#8212;namely, that it is not clear whether the many initiatives that have been mentioned are making real change&#8212;and suggests that an approach that is based on better partnership working is needed. Everyone has mentioned the partnership approach, which is particularly important in the context of community health partnerships.</p><p>I hope that the Government will take that main point on board when it looks at how best to deliver for our older people. I recognise that the cabinet secretary mentioned partnership working but, as we have seen in the past, it sometimes proves extremely difficult to achieve. My colleague Kenny Gibson mentioned that, throughout Scotland, partnership working is very patchy indeed.</p><p>In the past, I have raised the issue of having an older people&#8217;s assembly or parliament to discuss and decide on the best way forward. It seems clear to me that hearing older people&#8217;s views on the best way to tackle issues that affect them is a good idea, so I propose that idea as an appropriate next step to take in the general debate.</p><p>I mentioned the review of Scottish planning policy. I ask that the review looks at older people&#8217;s housing needs and councils&#8217; local development plans, which could include the identification of land and areas for the development of retirement housing of all tenures. I praise the City of Edinburgh Council, which as Malcolm Chisholm said has a 10-year plan. Many councils do not go as far as that. However, through Scottish planning policy, we have an opportunity for local councils and local development plans to consider older people&#8217;s housing needs.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685474", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Demographic change and an ageing population&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Certainly.

I am sure that I do not need to, but I suggest to Families Need Fathers and other groups that they take part in that consultation. I am sure that their participation would be more than welcome.</p><p>Families Need Fathers also makes a point about the courts that is similar to the point that John Mason made. In its briefing, it mentions contact orders, which are raised with me. John Mason explained the issue well. Contact orders should fulfil not just the needs of the mother and the father, but those of the child. That is an extremely important issue, which should be raised in the consultation on the proposed changes to court proceedings.</p><p>I hope that the recommendations that the strategy makes will go a long way to alleviating some of the difficulties that exist. One of the recommendations includes a</p><p>&#8220;Focus on fathers and male carers, including those who live away from their children&#8221;,</p><p>which is one of the issues that we are debating.

I would like to lay to rest the false claims by Gordon Matheson, the Labour leader of Glasgow City Council, Labour councillors, Labour MSPs such as Jackie Baillie and some people in the media with regard to how hard the council has it.

I thank Malcolm Chisholm and congratulate him on securing the debate. I also congratulate Zero Tolerance and the many other groups that have worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the truly horrific crime of domestic and sexual abuse.</p><p>The speeches have been excellent, although they have raised harrowing issues. As others, including Annabel Goldie, have said, it is not just the victims of domestic abuse&#8212;the women&#8212;who suffer; it is also the children who witness the abuse. I hope that the criminal justice bill, with its emphasis on the issue of corroboration, will be a positive move towards convictions for those horrific crimes.</p><p>I want to concentrate on one particular part of the motion&#8212;Malcolm Chisholm mentioned lap dancing clubs and adult entertainment&#8212;basically, the commercial side of sexual exploitation. It is something that I and others have worked to address for many years and I am grateful that other members have mentioned the bill that I tried to put through. Many of the members who are in the chamber will remember that before the 2011 elections I tried to put forward legislation that would enable councils to say that when it came to any form of sexual exploitation such as lap dancing clubs, pole dancing, adult entertainment venues and strip clubs, even one was too many. The councils would have the power to say that they did not want such clubs in their areas. I thought that it was a perfectly good piece of legislation. Unfortunately, as members will recollect, when it was put forward with Government support, the Opposition voted it down.</p><p>I am sorry about that, but I take heart from tonight&#8217;s speeches. It is a positive sign for the bill that I am proposing and also for the bill that has been proposed by Rhoda Grant. We should look at my bill and debate it and I hope that it will have cross-party support. I look forward to the debate on those members&#8217; bills.</p><p>I have been looking at the internet in relation to this topic and people have been sending me various newsworthy items as well. In the city of Aberdeen, there was a recent application for a new strip club. If it had been approved, Aberdeen would have had eight strip clubs&#8212;fortunately the application was thrown out. That would have been the largest number of such clubs in any city in Scotland. It would have been the same number as in central London.</p><p>I am reminded of the South Ayrshire application for a pole dancing club. The applicant was not going to apply but took heart from a change in council and also from the fact that Glasgow City Council was not allowed to stop such a club in Glasgow. The application was put forward and it was approved. Now we are looking at possibly four or five such clubs in the South Ayrshire area&#8212;not in a city. It is incumbent on us to say that legislation comes from the Parliament. It should be handed down to councils and they should have the right to say whether the local people want such a club.</p><p>As Malcolm Chisholm and others have mentioned, thoughts of sexual abuse and sexual violence start somewhere. Where do people see that? Graeme Pearson mentioned the internet and Hanzala Malik mentioned the television. Women are looked upon as objects and not human beings. That is where things start from. It is also about education, and we should consider that.</p><p>I am grateful for being allowed to speak in the debate and hope that people will support the legislation that will come through.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681105", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Zero Tolerance Campaigns"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful that the debate has been extended so that we can all make a contribution to it.

In the past 10 years, the total number of international migrants has increased from an estimated 150&#160;million to 214&#160;million. It is interesting that women account for 49 per cent of migrants worldwide.</p><p>After adoption of the convention, a first round of high-level dialogue on international migration and development took place in 2006. Participating member states affirmed a number of key messages. First, they underscored that international migration is a growing phenomenon that can make a positive contribution to development in countries of origin and destination, provided that it is supported by the right policies. Secondly, they emphasised that respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of all migrants is essential if we are to reap the benefits of international migration. Thirdly, they recognised the importance of strengthening international co-operation on international migration bilaterally, regionally and globally.</p><p>The next round of high-level dialogue will take place next year and will give member states and their partners a chance to discuss practical measures to facilitate labour mobility, to foster sustainable development and to protect the rights of migrants, especially women and girls.</p><p>As the secretary general of the UN said in his address to mark this year&#8217;s migrants&#8217; rights day:</p><p>&#8220;Attention to the rights of migrants is especially important at this time of global economic and financial distress. As budgets tighten, we are seeing austerity measures that discriminate against migrant workers, xenophobic rhetoric that encourages violence against irregular migrants, and proposed immigration laws that allow the police to profile migrants with impunity. During economic downturns, it is worth remembering that whole sectors of the economy depend on migrant workers and migrant entrepreneurs to help to create jobs.</p><p>When migration policies are developed without attention to vulnerability, marginalization and discrimination, millions of migrants become cheap, disposable labour, the scapegoats for failed economic and social policies, and even casualties in an ill-defined war against &#8216;illegal migration&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>It is a sad fact that in such difficult times, attitudes to migration harden. We must ensure that here in Scotland we continue to welcome migrants, who make a positive contribution to our society. It is perhaps timely, therefore, that only yesterday it was reported that Scotland&#8217;s population has hit a record high of nearly 5.3&#160;million people after a surge in inward migration and increased life expectancy.</p><p>As the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs has said, those figures represent a</p><p>&#8220;historic moment for our country ... A decade and more of devolution has delivered a growing and record high population. That is not simply a sign of the dynamic, attractive nation we are building. It is also a key factor in delivering economic growth in future years.&#8221;</p><p>Everyone in the chamber will have among their constituents many first-class migrant workers&#8212;people who came here not just to work within and help to boost our economy, but to help to enrich our country with their cultures and their attitudes. They should be praised for that. Instead, we sometimes see xenophobic comments in certain tabloid newspapers, and some politicians have a very wrong hard-line attitude towards migrant workers. It is important that we have this debate so that people in Scotland and throughout the world can realise the worth of migrant workers.</p><p>One organisation that is to be commended for its work in ensuring that migrants are welcome to Scotland and that they are able to become involved in the community is Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland. After setting up a separate organisation in Scotland in early 2010, it has supported migrants here in Scotland in a number of ways, including through the support of migrant community organisations, or MCOs. Without those volunteers, we would not know what was happening to migrants with regard to certain aspects of their experience, so it is incumbent on us to pay tribute to the workers in Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland for the hard work that they do to ensure that migrants have a welcome in our country. Also, as I said previously, the culture that migrants bring is greatly welcomed.</p><p>MCOs help migrants to share information and expertise while allowing them to become part of their local communities by putting them in touch with local organisations and encouraging them to get involved.</p><p>So far, the work that Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland has done has been hugely successful. However, there is much concern over recent changes to immigration policy by the United Kingdom Government. Those changes will have a detrimental impact on migration and even on migrants who are long-term British citizens. Undoubtedly the minister will be aware of those changes and how they will adversely affect migrants who already live here and those who wish to come here. What discussions has the Scottish Government had with the UK Government with regard to that?</p><p>The portfolio of experiences that is currently being compiled by Migrants&#8217; Rights Scotland on migrants&#8217; hopes and fears will be presented to the family migration inquiry at Westminster early in 2013. However, would the minister consider setting up a migrants conference here in Scotland, to hear from migrants who live in Scotland, in the hope that it would inform any future approach by the Scottish Government to the Westminster Government on the issue? I am interested to hear the minister&#8217;s response.</p><p>I draw members&#8217; attention to the reception that is being held after the debate in committee room 2 to bring together representatives of minority civic society groups, migrants and their families and MSPs to develop a deeper understanding of who counts as a migrant and of the issues that face real people as a result of immigration policy. I believe that the minister will be attending the reception. I ask members who are here, and others, to come along to committee room 2 to hear about the real experiences of the people there.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680273", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Migrants&#8217; Rights Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Christina McKelvie on securing the debate and I wish her a speedy recovery.

All of us in the Parliament should support them in doing that at this time.</p><p>When the 2012 act was passed, members of other parties raised the issue of political interference in the police force and wanted assurances that that would not happen. I agreed with that 100 per cent, and I still agree with it fully. That is one reason why I am a little confused by Lewis Macdonald&#8217;s motion, which clearly calls for a significant degree of political interference in the police force&#8212;something that he did not want when the act was passed. It would be confusing&#8212;or perhaps a little disappointing&#8212;if Mr Macdonald&#8217;s motion sought to make political capital out of a situation that we all want to see resolved.</p><p>It is worth noting the chief constable&#8217;s view on backfilling. He stated:</p><p>&#8220;there is no plan or strategy for reform that I am in charge of that is predicated on backfilling.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Justice Committee, 23 October 2012; c 1851.]</p><p>I welcome the chief constable&#8217;s assurances that backfilling will not happen on his watch. I also welcome the fact that both the chair of the Police Authority board and the chief constable have stated that they are focused on delivering the best police force possible for the people of Scotland. We should support them in that aim.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679000", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Policing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The issue might be the language that has been used by some, such as &#8220;dispute&#8221;.

It is a very good initiative and that might get across some of the concerns of members, the newspaper industry and our constituents.</p><p>I hope that the Presiding Office will indulge me if I widen the debate. The motion calls for a media panel. There has been talk about the newspaper industry, but I wonder whether the cabinet secretary, if she wanted to create such a panel, would widen it to include other aspects of the media, such as the entertainment industry, and look at the situation that it faces in Scotland as highlighted in the Equity make it in Scotland campaign. The campaign is supported by not just Equity&#8217;s branches in Scotland but all its branches in the United Kingdom and calls on the entertainment industry and Governments to invest in programmes that are made in Scotland.</p><p>A quote from the Equity website about the campaign says:</p><p>&#8220;Members are frustrated at not getting local opportunities, particularly because they believe there is a wealth of talent outside of London. &#8216;There&#8217;s a perception among the media elite that you can&#8217;t be any good unless you go to London, but why shouldn&#8217;t Scottish performers and crew be able to make a living in their own country?,&#8217; said actor Michael Mackenzie.</p><p>According to Ofcom, 61.8 per cent of spending by public service broadcasting channels in 2010 went to productions made within the M25. Productions in Scotland received 4.6 per cent of spending, Wales 2.6 per cent and Northern Ireland 0.4 per cent.&#8221;</p><p>The issue is clearly a live one.</p><p>I have spoken previously to Equity about the matter, and I went to Equity&#8217;s make it in Scotland reception that it held in the Parliament on Tuesday night. It basically said that some programmes that are not made in Scotland are labelled as being made in Scotland. Equity is not calling for all Scottish programmes to have only Scottish actors; it is just asking for justice and fairness.</p><p>I know that the powers to make some media regulations&#8212;such as those relating to Ofcom&#8212;are not delegated to the Scottish Parliament but, as others have said, the issue is not just about radio or newspapers. Margo MacDonald&#8212;she is no longer in the chamber&#8212;made the valid point that we must get the situation in Scotland sorted first. If we are losing talent, how can that talent be replaced?</p><p>I make the plea that if we are looking at having such a panel, we involve other parts of the industry, including the entertainment industry. We have Creative Scotland; we have had loads of fantastic films made, particularly in the Glasgow area; we have had Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt&#8212;to name just a few of the people involved, although I did not meet when they were in Glasgow.

I congratulate my colleague Linda Fabiani on securing the debate and on all the work that she has done on the issue. I also congratulate the members of the previous cross-party group on asylum seekers and refugees, the Refugee Survival Trust and the Scottish Refugee Council.</p><p>I start by commenting on the news that came through today or last night that 150 unopened boxes of applications for asylum in the UK have been found. They have been there for God knows how many months, or even years. That shows just how bad the system is in this country. We must highlight the fact that those applications are sitting there, unopened, while people are waiting for them just to be looked at, never mind put through the system. We really need to take that on board.</p><p>Zimbabwe, Iraq and Afghanistan have been mentioned as countries from which asylum seekers have fled. Those people absolutely deserve our help and security. What has not been mentioned is the fact that there are some people in this country who cannot go back to their own country. That is recognised by the UK, which tells asylum seekers who come from countries on a list that it holds: &#8220;Sorry, you can&#8217;t get asylum, but it&#8217;s too dangerous for you to go back to your own country so we&#8217;re going to make you destitute.&#8221; Those people have nowhere else to go and through no fault of their own have had to flee violence, yet the UK will not give them the succour that they deserve. We must remember that there are certain people in this country who are told that they cannot go back to their own country because it is not safe, but, because they will not be given asylum here, they can go out and sleep on the streets.</p><p>Linda Fabiani mentioned the gentleman who died on the bus. I met that gentleman. He got help, to an extent, as everyone else did&#8212;he had a sleeping bag from the Simon Community. He slept in a graveyard one night, in the winter time, and he was not a young man. Perhaps lots of people in Glasgow knew that gentleman pretty well, yet we could not help him in the end. That is a terrible indictment not just of us, but of humanity. That is what this is about&#8212;it is about humanity, and trying to help those people, because we are all human beings.</p><p>People have mentioned constituents. Whether or not people have a right to remain here, if they live in my constituency, they are obviously my constituents. I will tell members about two of my constituents. One is a gentleman who has leave to remain&#8212;he has a British passport. The other is a lady who is still awaiting a final decision, having been here for six or seven years. They applied to the UK Border Agency to get married&#8212;they were living together, having met at college, where they were learning English&#8212;and the UKBA said yes.</p><p>However, now the lady has been refused leave to remain, and they are looking at an appeal. She has been told to go back to her own country and apply from there, and that her husband should go back with her. I will not name them or say which country they come from, but I ask members to guess how old they are. They are 63 years of age, yet&#8212;despite the fact that the husband has a British passport&#8212;they are being told to go back to their country and that maybe they will be able to apply to come back in. What does that say about the UK as a whole? A 63-year-old couple, who are doing nobody any harm whatsoever and who bring great joy to the community that they live in, are being told that they cannot stay and that they must go back. That shows what an absolute disgrace the asylum system is.</p><p>I will finish on a wee point that other members will probably make. Those people are my constituents&#8212;but they are everyone&#8217;s constituents, too. We deal with such people daily and it is about time that the UK Government recognised that and recognised that we should be able to represent our constituents.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers (Destitution)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a great pleasure to speak in this debate.

Not a lot has been said about the involvement of the Scottish Parliament staff with Malawi through the CPA. I will name a couple of projects that went through the CPA&#8212;there were study visits by Malawi committee clerks to the Scottish Parliament, who learned from that experience, and Scottish Parliament committee clerks have held workshops in Malawi to show what we do here and to share their expertise. There has also been a successful internship programme when a Malawian clerk came over here and shadowed and worked closely with the Parliament staff. That is partnership working.</p><p>Engagement with Malawi has provided a direct international perspective for MSPs and Parliament staff and has allowed them to work with people in Malawi as equal partners&#8212;that is an important point&#8212;to share knowledge and experience.

First, I will touch on the proposed Scottish civil justice council. Having looked through the papers and read the Justice Committee&#8217;s report, I believe that the council will be an agent of change. It will have a much wider role than the rules councils for the sheriff courts and the Court of Session, which&#8212;as members have mentioned&#8212;it will replace. I believe that giving the council a wider role to advise and make recommendations on improving the civil justice system is generally a good thing.</p><p>Jenny Marra and other members raised the point about lay members of the new council, and I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s reply that he will address that issue in his speech.</p><p>I want to ask the cabinet secretary a couple of questions about the civil justice council, which will undergo changes throughout the years as the justice system changes. Does the cabinet secretary view the council as an evolving body?</p><p>Can he reassure members that, if the changes are to take place, they will be monitored and&#8212;as my colleague mentioned&#8212;checks and balances will be put in place to ensure that there is full transparency in the council and discussion at a parliamentary level or otherwise?</p><p>Part 2 of the bill refers to criminal legal assistance. I have respect for Malcolm Chisholm and I take on board what he has said. However, if we are to protect access to the justice system as far as possible in relation to civil and criminal cases, we must target legal assistance at those who need it the most.</p><p>It is right for those who can afford to pay towards the cost of their defence to do so, which is what happens at present with civil legal aid. The expansion of contributions brings criminal legal aid in line with civil legal aid and corrects a manifest injustice in the current system.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm and the cabinet secretary have both mentioned that issue. However, is it right that a victim of domestic violence must go to court to protect herself and be liable for a contribution to civil legal aid while the perpetrator of the crime can receive full criminal legal aid even if they have far greater financial resources? To my mind, that is grossly unfair and I think that most people would see it in that way.</p><p>Almost every member has mentioned the &#163;68 threshold. As I said, I have been reading through the papers as a new member of the Justice Committee, and my understanding is that the starting figure of &#163;68 per week is not&#8212;as Mary Fee mentioned in her contribution&#8212;gross income or even take-home income. It is what is left after deductions, and there is quite a long list of deductions. It includes housing costs, council tax, childcare costs, loan repayments, maintenance repayments, costs associated with disability&#8212;which have been mentioned and which I will pick up on&#8212;and an allowance for dependent spouses and children. On top of that, the board has the discretion to waive a contribution if it would cause undue hardship. We need to look at that particular issue, but we have had assurances that the &#163;68 figure can be reviewed.</p><p>Like others, I thank the cabinet secretary for what he said about DLA, which I regard as a positive step. I also thank Inclusion Scotland for its welcome briefing and positive comments on the subject of legal aid and benefits.

Of course, we cannot stop&#8212;and, perhaps importantly, some people would not want to stop&#8212;the growth of certain media and people&#8217;s access to it.</p><p>It is important to debate the role of the media in the justice system in order to listen to both sides of the argument, and I hope that we can move towards a consensus on the best way forward. Some argue that we need to look more closely at the juror system and even suggest that we should explore the possibility of having professional jurors. I take on board the minister&#8217;s comments on jurors, but I would like to touch on that aspect. The idea of professional jurors involves jurors being trained to understand the complexities of some cases and have expert knowledge, or being given a better understanding of the media and social media in particular.</p><p>A recent&#8212;unintended&#8212;case of expert jurors in America springs to mind. In a patent dispute between two very well-known companies over the use of software, one juror was revealed to have expert knowledge of software. In his words, he was quickly able to see that copyright had been infringed. In an interview after the trial, he said that he was able to inform the other jurors of his knowledge, and the reasons for his decisions helped the jury to reach a verdict much more quickly than it might have done without him.</p><p>In that case, having a juror with expert knowledge of a complex issue seems to have helped in reaching a verdict, but I am still to be convinced that moving towards a system in which all jurors are professionally appointed is the way to go. The professionalisation of the jury service could raise a number of questions about its impartiality, which is of serious concern, although I take on board what the minister said.</p><p>We all know that our jury system is intended to represent a broad section of society and to involve people of many differing backgrounds, professions and opinions, who can reach some form of consensus. However, I admit that, given the complexity of some criminal trials, many jurors may feel somewhat overwhelmed&#8212;other members have mentioned that. In such cases, it would be a good idea to explore the possibility of offering impartial expert advice on the issue and on points of law that are being discussed.</p><p>On broadcasting criminal trials, I have sympathy with the idea of having wider access, transparency and therefore oversight of trials in general, but it is important for any move towards more coverage to ensure that the principle of protection for the victims and the accused is paramount. Many witnesses expressed concern to the Justice Committee about the need to protect victims and witnesses from any undue stress as a result of the media&#8217;s role. Going to court can be a difficult experience for many, as they have to relive the crime that was perpetrated against them and face the accused. That can be traumatic, as Lewis Macdonald said.</p><p>As was mentioned in the committee&#8217;s evidence session, it is true that many witnesses come forward reluctantly. However, if they did not come forward in the first place, we might not get a conviction for many crimes, especially those of a violent or sexual nature. That issue is of paramount importance in informing any proposals.</p><p>Conversely, it is also important to protect those who are accused. Many people have mentioned Aamer Anwar. In his evidence, he noted that it is important to protect the rights of the accused who are subsequently acquitted. I agree that that is important. We have all read about cases&#8212;some have been mentioned&#8212;in which the police have released the name and details of their suspect, only for that to be the wrong person. In the time that it has taken for the mistake to be corrected, the media have seized on that information and, in the process of reporting, put the suspect and their family under considerable stress.</p><p>That can also be the case with trials, which are highly publicised. Even if the accused is acquitted, they may find themselves having to live with the public perception that they are somehow guilty by association for many years to come.</p><p>If reform is needed&#8212;and I say &#8220;if&#8221;&#8212;it must be done as carefully as possible to ensure that people have the right to a fair trial by their peers and that those who are involved in the criminal trial are protected at all times.</p><p>The genie cannot be put back in the bottle, but&#8212;as in many stories involving genies&#8212;we must be very careful about how we deal with the issue once the genie is out of the bottle.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of the Media in Criminal Trials"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will try to be as speedy as I can be, to allow everyone to speak.

Unintended consequences could arise in relation to the treatment of victims in domestic abuse and rape and sexual assault cases; removal of corroboration, particularly in rape cases, would likely place a greater emphasis on their testimony, character, sexual history, medical history, etc, with the defence arguing that questioning has to be more &#8216;robust&#8217; and probing.&#8221;</p><p>I know that the proposals are out to consultation, but those important points must be kept in mind.

It is a pity that that was not part of the amendment, which certainly did not read that way to me. The bill is all about what the member says&#8212;giving people more powers to be involved in their communities.</p><p>Members have talked about local government. The concordat between the Scottish Government and local government has its detractors&#8212;we have heard from a few of them today&#8212;but its real aim is to devolve more power over decision making to local authorities so that they can decide what their priorities are. Surely that is a good thing. Although we may debate that in another sphere, it must be a good thing to be able to work together to give real power to local communities.</p><p>The Labour Party&#8217;s amendment seems entirely reasonable. The community right to buy, which Sarah Boyack mentioned, is one of the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s landmark achievements. Like Sarah Boyack and others, I hope that the experience of rural communities will generally inform the process to be followed in urban areas. For instance, in Glasgow&#8212;in my constituency and in others&#8212;we have often looked on enviously as communities in rural areas have been able to take forward a real vision of what they see as a local asset and have been able to provide it to the community, being able to take over public assets. It would be fantastic if we could do that in inner cities as well.</p><p>Members have cited examples from their areas. There is a fantastic building at the bottom of Byres Road, in my constituency, which used to be the old Church Street baths. When I have been walking around my constituency, people have asked me on numerous occasions whether we can turn the building back into swimming baths, but I do not know. They have also said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a great building. Can we turn it into a market?&#8221; I do not know, although I have written letters about it. If we can get a commitment to turn it into something that people would dedicate themselves to, that would be absolutely fantastic. It would also be fantastic if the bill could give us the necessary tools to do that.</p><p>Since the consultation opened, I have sent out loads of messages to my contacts to ask them to respond, and I know that they have done so. People are very excited and energised about what the bill could do for them, and local communities will certainly use the opportunities that it provides.</p><p>Community planning partnerships, community councils and local groups are working together, but they sometimes feel that they are hindered by current legislation and the lack of devolved decision making at a local level. I ask the minister and encourage the Government to work closely with those groups, local authorities and others to facilitate the devolution of more power to local communities.</p><p>We can learn from what has already been achieved. One example of good practice is the Glasgow Woodlands Community Development Trust, which was set up in 1985 by local residents with support from Glasgow City Council and, later on, from the Scottish Parliament. It has gone from strength to strength, involving local nurseries and schools, and it is a fantastic community asset. The climate change fund, zero waste Scotland and&#8212;as I said&#8212;Glasgow City Council have all helped in taking it forward.</p><p>Another example is the SAGE&#8212;sow and grow everywhere&#8212;project, which is in the middle of Glasgow city centre, not far from where I live. I have an allotment there, although I must admit that I should get my green fingers out and do some work. The project has been taken forward with Government funding and help, and we need to look at that type of thing.</p><p>It is important that we give local communities a say, and the provisions in the bill will enable us to do that. I look forward to further consultation and to examining the ideas that come in, and&#8212;I hope&#8212;to another debate to scrutinise the consultation results.

I would love to have a tea in Gina&#8217;s cafe, although I am not auditioning at the moment. I have met Gina on many occasions, particularly at Queen&#8217;s Cross Housing Association events in Maryhill&#8212;I know that Patricia Ferguson knows her well, too&#8212;where she does a lot of charity work.</p><p>&#8220;River City&#8221; is fantastic&#8212;look at the dedication of those involved and the talent and expertise that it has produced over the years. It has raised issues pertinent to Scotland. It encapsulates all that is good in Scottish broadcasting.</p><p>The motion mentions the 10th anniversary of &#8220;River City&#8221; in September 2012. I remind the chamber&#8212;and perhaps Jackie Baillie in particular&#8212;about the fact that in September 2011, the BBC was trying to close down &#8220;River City&#8221;. I have a copy of a press release about that. Notable figures such as Andy Murray and Lorraine Kelly signed a petition to keep &#8220;River City&#8221; going. So just last September, the BBC was talking about axing &#8220;River City&#8221;. It is apt to raise that.</p><p>Jackie Baillie touched on certain aspects of BBC Scotland, although perhaps not in the way that I will touch on them, and John Finnie raised the issue of BBC Scotland job losses during First Minister&#8217;s questions today. There are various issues around the BBC&#8212;issues that I have raised&#8212;to do with cuts to programmes and to funding for Scottish broadcasting. The First Minister, in his reply to John Finnie, said that that was absolutely disgraceful&#8212;and I think so, too. Unlike Jackie Baillie, I think that we should be pushing for more broadcasting powers to come to Scotland in order to ensure that programmes such as &#8220;River City&#8221; are not axed and people do not lose their jobs.</p><p>A 16 per cent cut in funding from the BBC will have terrible adverse effects. It is not just the people who petitioned last year who are concerned about that. I have a letter from a member of the Scottish committee of Equity, which states:</p><p>&#8220;Equity is launching a campaign calling for more television drama to be made in Scotland using the talent that lives here.&#8221;</p><p>It is a very good letter and I will be happy to pass it to the cabinet secretary. It goes on to say that, in recent years, too many jobs have been moved down to London,</p><p>&#8220;employment prospects of technicians in Scotland&#8221;</p><p>are being lost and the performers in these fantastic programmes</p><p>&#8220;have been ignored&#8221;.</p><p>I would like the cabinet secretary to take that on board.</p><p>Annabel Goldie said that the programme is relevant to Scotland&#8217;s social issues, and she is absolutely right. Most recently, the obesity situation with Big Bob has touched the hearts of many people&#8212;not just men, but women as well&#8212;including people who did not realise the adverse effects of obesity, such as diabetes. The issue of trafficking was covered recently as well, and I thought that the way it was handled was fantastic. The programme has also raised the issues of drugs and alcohol, death, marital break-ups, problems within the family&#8212;all issues that are pertinent not just to Scottish society, but to society as a whole.</p><p>As I said, I have been a fan of &#8220;River City&#8221; for many years, during which I have watched it develop. Even in the past nine months, it has changed its tune slightly, if members will pardon the pun, because there is certainly more music in it. In focusing on certain issues, it has really touched the hearts of the Scottish people and reflected what they are going through. We had the situation in which the doctor went over to Liberia to help people there, and the programme showed a pan shot of Glasgow in which poverty was rife. That was very touching. It certainly touched me, and I imagine that it touched many other people. The doctor was going to another country to help people there, but we saw a pan shot of the real poverty in Glasgow.</p><p>&#8220;River City&#8221; is a fantastic programme and a fantastic production. I praise everybody who takes part in it, but I also want to raise the issue of the funding cuts. Let us not forget that, exactly a year ago, in September 2011, the BBC was going to axe the programme. If it was not for the campaign that was run by a newspaper and people such as Andy Murray and Lorraine Kelly and the many others who signed the petition, we might not be having this debate today. I ask people to remember that, and the fact that the forthcoming cuts to the BBC could still lead to the axing of the programme.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671634", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;River City&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Annabel Goldie on securing the debate.

Neil Bibby and other members were correct to mention the consensus in the debate. We all feel exactly the same way&#8212;we want to do something positive and work together.</p><p>I will expand on the benefits changes that the Westminster Government has proposed, and which Maureen Watt touched on. Under those changes, claimants who have drug and alcohol problems will be forced into accepting treatment. Otherwise, their benefits will be cut. Kezia Dugdale has talked about people with chaotic lifestyles being forced into treatment. It is difficult for such people to cope with bureaucracy. Conservative members should let their counterparts in Westminster know what we are doing in Scotland and tell them that the proposals will be counterproductive to the work that is being undertaken in Parliament and throughout Scotland. The changes are the worst thing that could happen to drug users. The demands that will be made on them will do more harm than good.</p><p>Christine Duncan of Scottish Families Affected by Drugs said:</p><p>&#8220;Proposals from the UK Government to link benefits with accessing drug and alcohol treatment are quite worrying as this would have the impact of adding pressure to someone&#8217;s personal attempts at recovery which can only impact even more on families and carers. We support the Scottish Drugs Forum call to the Scottish Government to maintain the thrust of the Road to Recovery.&#8221;</p><p>I accept what Nanette Milne said about recovery and relapse, but we need to look at the benefits system, because the changes will do more harm than good.</p><p>I pay tribute to the many groups and individuals who face every day the reality of drug abuse and its tragic consequences. For example, Glasgow North United Communities provides fantastic support to families and individuals whose lives have been affected and, in many cases, completely destroyed by drug abuse. As Neil Bibby and other members have, I have visited many such groups and individuals in the Glasgow area and know of situations in which grandparents look after their grandchildren, sometimes while still looking after their grown-up children who have drug problems. There are individuals who have reached rock-bottom and if it was not for the support of families and support groups, they simply would not be here today. I take my hat off to those grandparents. I will not recount individual constituents&#8217; stories, but some of those stories would have you on your knees. They are people who are just trying to get through life.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale and others have referred to the stigma of drug abuse. We talk about families in terms of grandparents, mothers, brothers, sisters and fathers, but there is a bigger family out there and people with drugs problems have to spend a long while in recovery mode before they can get back into the family group as a mother or father, for example. I pay tribute to the effort that such people make. They sometimes do not have support at the start, but they tend to find it. However, it can still take them many years to recover.</p><p>Members may think that I am not being consensual in terms of the debate, but I believe that we need to look at the UK Government&#8217;s benefits changes. I hope that we are trying to ensure that people with drug problems are on the road to recovery and will not relapse, but if they are forced into getting treatment that may not be suitable for them, they probably will relapse and all the good work will be wasted.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Kezia Dugdale for her informative speech&#8212;I will certainly visit the cafe that is just around the corner from here.

As a previous member of that committee, I am proud to say that it lives up to its name and I commend its work.</p><p>Research has concluded that, in developed nations, there are clear links between higher rates of women&#8217;s employment and lower rates of child poverty. As Mary Fee said, Sweden and other small countries lead the way on that, while in Scotland there are much lower rates of maternal employment and much higher rates of child poverty. As Malcolm Chisholm said, there are certainly many lessons to be learned from other countries, particularly the Nordic countries.</p><p>I welcome the minister&#8217;s announcement that the women&#8217;s jobs summit will take place on 12 September. Among other issues, it will discuss childcare, which has been raised by almost every member so far; indeed, Ken Macintosh says that is his number 1 priority for getting women back into work. Although I welcome the increase in free nursery education for three to four-year-olds and looked-after two-year-olds, responsibility for children does not end when they reach a certain age. We have sometimes overlooked that when we have considered the various issues of nursery care.</p><p>We need to provide affordable childcare for the age group that is not in nursery school. Many women prefer not to go back to work when their kids are at nursery, if they are fortunate enough, but they want to go to work when their kids start school and the problems sometimes start there. They cannot re-enter their career and cannot re-enter the workforce.</p><p>A number of members mentioned the proportion of women in particular jobs. I will give members some of the stats that I looked up. In health and social care, 85 per cent of workers are female, yet in construction, 99 per cent of workers are male. In early years care and education&#8212;a very important career&#8212;98 per cent of workers are female, yet in vehicle maintenance, 98 per cent of workers are male. We must ask ourselves something here&#8212;it is a basic issue that every member has raised. Is that to do with gender stereotyping or cultural attitudes, and what can we do about it?</p><p>One of the things that we can do about it&#8212;and the Government can perhaps raise this issue at the jobs summit&#8212;is a positive attitude, which goes a long way. Obviously, having more female representation in the Scottish Parliament promotes a positive attitude to young women. Politicians can go out to schools and speak to young women&#8217;s groups to tell them where they can go, what we have achieved and how they, too, can achieve it. The media, teachers and parents can all put forward a positive attitude towards women.</p><p>Are the jobs and careers that have predominantly women employees undervalued? Is enough emphasis put on jobs such as teachers, nursery teachers, hospital workers and nurses, which are very important jobs? They seem to be undervalued. As Malcolm Chisholm said, it is about the economy. If women have the money, they will spend it, and their kids will be taken out of poverty. Perhaps the Government&#8212;possibly at the summit&#8212;will look at the undervaluing of those jobs. Perhaps it will take the lead by looking at the modern apprenticeship scheme to see where the money is going&#8212;whether it is to construction or to social care, as well.</p><p>I am grateful for being able to take part in the debate.

That is entirely different from my experience at school.</p><p>I do not know whether other members had the same experience as me, but the only language that was available to me and others at that time was French. Basically we learned by rote and sometimes through song, but mostly through verbs, grammar and many hours of writing down conversations. It was not an enjoyable experience, which is why I am so pleased when I see the difference now in schools, where kids learn languages conversationally. They are interested in the language. They learn names, colours, flowers, books, magazines and films&#8212;Linda Fabiani mentioned watching a television programme in black and white, which I can also remember. All those things encourage kids to learn and keep their interest.</p><p>Kezia Dugdale said that she did not have an ear for learning languages, but that she wishes that she had done, because it would have been useful in later life. Similarly, when I was 16 I decided that I would go and learn German. I went to Jordanhill College. I had never learned German in my life before, but I wanted to do something even though school had not encouraged me, or others. Perhaps if we had had the type of learning that we have now and which we will have in the future, we might not have been quite so frightened to learn other languages.</p><p>There is a fantastic opportunity now and we are giving kids the chance to learn languages. Liam McArthur and others mentioned the economic benefit of learning languages and that is fantastic for Scotland as a whole. However, it is not only about the economic benefit; it is about the confidence that kids get from learning languages and the fact that it opens up a whole new world to them. In fact, my granddaughter was born in Barcelona and by the time that she was two she could speak Catalan. The extent to which kids can absorb information like sponges and pick up a language is unbelievable.</p><p>That is why we should all welcome the Government&#8217;s forward programme. I am sure that the minister agrees that there may be issues that we have to look at; Elizabeth Smith and others picked up on some of those issues. However, it is worth looking forward to ensure that our kids have a great opportunity.</p><p>The working group&#8217;s recommendation 18 states</p><p>&#8220;that SQA keep under review the suite of languages offered&#8221;.</p><p>Recommendation 19 states</p><p>&#8220;that there be further engagement with the FE and HE sectors&#8221;.</p><p>Recommendation 23 states</p><p>&#8220;that universities work together as a consortium of university providers to support delivery&#8221;.</p><p>Finally, recommendation 27 states</p><p>&#8220;that Scottish Government and Universities work with Local Authorities&#8221;.</p><p>I highlight those recommendations because they mention universities, the SQA and others but, as far as I can see, there is no mention of the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council. Will the minister pick up on that when she sums up the debate? Without the Scottish funding council, the moneys to deliver languages in universities are not there. What role does the funding council have in the process?</p><p>Maureen Watt and Kevin Stewart both mentioned the teaching of the Polish language. There is a fantastic course at the University of Glasgow in Czech, Polish and Slavonic studies, but its funding is being ended. The Scottish funding council is obviously involved in that situation, too. The centre for Russian, central and east European studies is the only one of its kind in Scotland. If the centre closes, people who want to continue their studies in that subject will have to go to London; that will be the only option left in the UK. It is imperative that the Scottish funding council considers the situation and ensures that the centre continues, given the good work that it does. Polish has been mentioned and there is also Russian. All countries should be involved. Kids should be encouraged to learn all languages.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667521", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Languages (Improving Opportunities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was going to begin my contribution in parliamo Glasgow, but I thought that I had better not, as even I have trouble understanding it.

The health issues, which are extremely important, have been covered, but I want to focus on two specific issues: overconsumption of alcohol and availability of cheap alcohol, and the problems that they give rise to.</p><p>As the constituency member for Glasgow Kelvin, I represent an area that has the greatest concentration in Glasgow&#8212;possibly in Scotland&#8212;of pubs, clubs, theatres and entertainment venues, which stretch from Byres Road in the west to Sauchiehall Street and the merchant city in the city centre. The area is the hub of Glasgow&#8217;s night life, where thriving businesses attract thousands of visitors&#8212;tourists and locals alike&#8212;at the weekend. They are what makes Glasgow famous and so vibrant.</p><p>However, it would be remiss of me not to say that in some&#8212;but not all&#8212;areas we have problems that are caused by overconsumption of alcohol. Overconsumption causes problems not just for the consumer of alcohol, but for the police, medics and the public in general. The issue must be tackled. Although, as the cabinet secretary said, minimum pricing is not a panacea, we must do something to ensure that we no longer see people lying on pavements or in gutters absolutely drunk. We must do so not just for health reasons, but for the sake of the economy and of the people who visit Glasgow and other parts of Scotland.</p><p>The pubs and clubs are not solely responsible for the problem; it is mainly a result of the so-called pre-loading of cheap alcohol that has been bought in supermarkets. In some cases, it is cheaper to buy a litre of alcoholic drink than it is to buy a litre of water. I have spoken to many people in the licensed trade in Glasgow. Paul Waterson of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association says that we need minimum pricing because there is no control over the drinking of people who buy alcohol from supermarkets at knock-down prices. He believes that some people drink for drinking&#8217;s sake. Pre-loading of cheap alcohol has become endemic. People who go to licensed premises drink in a controlled environment, but if they drink at home, there is no control. When people go out after getting tanked up on cheap supermarket booze, it is the pubs and the clubs that have to deal with them. We should listen to the SLTA.</p><p>The Deputy First Minister mentioned the fact that the pub trade is struggling, and she is absolutely right. Once-thriving pubs, many of which used to be hubs of their communities, are indeed struggling because supermarkets are selling cheap booze. Local pubs that were once social meeting places for many people are closing. I think&#8212;I know that the licensed trade does, too&#8212;that the balance has shifted too far, so we need to look at restoring the balance.</p><p>At one time, people would go out to pubs to enjoy the sociable atmosphere, but with the availability of cheap booze, that is no longer the case. I have some figures that illustrate that. Off-trade sales increased by 52 per cent between 1994 and 2010, whereas the on-trade experienced a fall in sales of 29 per cent. I am talking about the city centre of Glasgow and other areas that I represent; I am talking about pubs that are hubs in their communities and are social gathering places. It is time we listened to the licensed trade. I hope that we can resurrect some of those local pubs, which do so much for communities.</p><p>As I have said, minimum pricing is not a panacea, but it is a start, and we should all fully support it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667845", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am grateful to be able to speak in the debate, given that I am not a member of the Health and Sport Committee.

I was most impressed by the vitality of the people and the resilience that they showed through the blockade by America.</p><p>We must be honest about the fact that the blockade obviously affects Cuba&#8217;s economy. However, as I toured the educational establishments, including universities and colleges, and visited hospitals&#8212;the service there is excellent, particularly in the eye hospitals, which are renowned around the world&#8212;I was impressed by the facilities. As Elaine Smith said, Cuba is a world leader in its health service and its education establishments. We can all learn from that and we must tell the rest of the world that the blockade is absolutely insane, not just for Cuba but for the rest of the world and America in particular.</p><p>I spoke to many officials in Cuba, who took me on tours of official establishments while my husband enjoyed the sun, sea and salsa. I was struck by the fact that, although Miami is only a couple of miles from Cuba, people in Cuba must get dried milk from Australia. That is unbelievable.

It would be remiss of me not to mention that four out of five of the national companies are based in Glasgow; indeed, three of them are based in my constituency of Glasgow Kelvin. The upgrading of the Theatre Royal and the Royal concert hall is welcome, but I make a plea for the Pavilion theatre in Glasgow, which is very short of funds and does not get any public funds at all.</p><p>I agree entirely with the sentiments that are expressed in Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s amendment. I am glad that we have accepted her amendment. I welcome the fact that the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring the widest possible participation throughout Scotland, as shown by the fact that NPCs must meet certain criteria set out by the Scottish Government. One criterion is that, to be eligible for central funding, NPCs must ensure that they perform to a wide and diverse audience in Scotland, that they have community education programmes and that they work with other NPCs.</p><p>I have a revelation to share. I have discovered a composer through someone in my constituency and Creative Scotland. Last week, I had a meeting with Creative Scotland, which works closely with the national companies, to look at digitising the work of one of Scotland&#8217;s greatest composers, Thomas Wilson, who produced more than 100 works in a range of different styles, including orchestra and ballet. I met Mr Wilson&#8217;s widow to discuss her late husband&#8217;s work and the digitisation of his manuscripts. During a very pleasant afternoon, Mrs Wilson told me about the many requests and visits that she had received from people from outside Scotland seeking her husband&#8217;s work. Indeed, she told me about a Spanish teacher who had introduced schoolchildren to Mr Wilson&#8217;s work. I heard a small piece, which was a delight. The point that I am trying to make is that, as well as the national performing companies, organisations such as Creative Scotland and others can work together to help to produce great artists who some people have not heard of.</p><p>That discussion led us to discuss the great effect and importance of widening the appeal of the performing arts to schools, communities and individuals that may previously have had little or no experience of them. The national and international importance of the national performing companies is undoubted, but it is equally important&#8212;if not more important&#8212;to use them to get as many people as possible involved in the arts.</p><p>The Royal Scottish National Orchestra, which is based in Kelvin, does a huge amount of outreach work, such as its monster music concerts, which are aimed at three to five-year-olds. The cabinet secretary and other speakers mentioned those concerts, which involve well-known songs and nursery rhymes, encourage the kids to join in in whatever way they can, introduce them to basic musical concepts&#8212;high and low, fast and slow&#8212;and give them an initial interest. I hope that they will get some enjoyment out of that interest as they continue to enjoy music. That work is followed up by mega music concerts for primary 5s to primary 7s and maestro music concerts for secondary school kids. All those concerts give kids the opportunity to learn more about music. The orchestra also provides teacher training sessions and packs to be used in class.</p><p>Although that programme of events is fantastic, I cannot help but think that there is something missing: what about kids in primary school up to primary 5?

They have done an excellent job. As many members have said, we have been looking for such recommendations for a number of years, so I welcome the report.</p><p>Women make up 5 per cent of the overall prison population. The vast majority are reoffenders who have addiction issues and mental health problems and have experienced terrible social circumstances. Most are certainly not a threat to society; as the cabinet secretary said, most of them are, unfortunately, a threat only to themselves. That is why I believe that the recommendations in the report&#8212;radical though they may seem to some people&#8212;are correct. Alternative treatment must be explored and offered to women who would benefit from that.</p><p>When I was a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee in the previous session of Parliament, I visited Cornton Vale along with other members&#8212;others have mentioned that visit&#8212;and saw at first hand the conditions in the prison. There was a lack of privacy: the women had to queue up for a shower, and the shower curtains were missing; and they had to ask to go to the bathroom, which had a half door that gave no privacy and was very demeaning. That issue is covered in the report. Sports facilities were practically non-existent and were unfit for anyone who wanted to get in any form of exercise. Unfortunately, the situation is still the same.</p><p>We were also concerned by the lack of family visiting facilities and the very poor space where families could come to visit. We must bear it in mind that Cornton Vale is a women&#8217;s prison and that the women&#8217;s children visit them. That is the only contact that some of the women have with their school-age kids. That issue must be explored. Unfortunately, as others have said, very little support has been forthcoming from the Scottish Prison Service. I implore the SPS to create a visitor centre&#8212;perhaps the cabinet secretary could also implore it to do so. We obviously hope that Cornton Vale will not continue as it is now, but in the meantime some improvement would be excellent for the women.</p><p>Many members have mentioned statistics and so on, but I will concentrate on the visit to Cornton Vale that the Equal Opportunities Committee undertook in the previous session of Parliament. The issues that I have raised were of concern, but of more concern were the women themselves and the experiences that they had gone through. We were, rightly, not allowed to ask what their crimes were, but the women were anxious to speak to us, individually or in groups, and tell us about their experience of life inside and outside prison.</p><p>The majority of the women were in prison for low-level crimes. Margaret Mitchell mentioned the revolving-door situation, and many of them spoke about that, too, saying that they could not find a way out. Most of the women had suffered from domestic abuse and other forms of abuse, mental health problems and addiction.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell and others will remember the woman who was in what I believe is called a silent cell&#8212;Alison McInnes mentioned that&#8212;with just a mattress on the floor. She was very much suffering from mental health problems. She could tell us all the medication that she was on and all the medical terminology for her condition, yet she was sitting on a mattress in a bare cell. She should never have been in prison; she should have been in a hospital, getting care.</p><p>I was chilled to the bone when I spoke to a woman who would not be out of prison in time to see her four kids at Christmas. She had reoffended but what really got me was that she felt safer in prison than outside, because of the environment that she lived in. She was willing to risk not having Christmas with her four kids because she was terrified of what awaited her outside. That was chilling.</p><p>We have to think about new ways of treating women in prison. Some of those women were institutionalised. It is quite chilling to think that someone felt safer in prison, with its lack of amenities, than they would feel outside. That is a damning indictment of the society that we live in. I endorse everything that is in the Angiolini report. I would have thought that anyone would rather be outside, enjoying Christmas with their children, than in prison, queueing up to go to the toilet or have a shower, yet those women said that they felt safer in prison. That is institutionalisation, and we have to do something about it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665994", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Women Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that members will all agree that this is an important debate.

We asked the people in what is now my constituency exactly what they wanted from transport. I know that we are concentrating on buses, but the motion is entitled &#8220;Transport&#8221;, so I could perhaps widen the debate out a little bit.</p><p>People certainly wanted decent buses running at the proper times with a decent bus fare, but they also wanted joined-up thinking. I think that we have sometimes lost the point about the importance of joined-up thinking. If my memory serves me right, this is the third debate that the Labour Party has held in Parliament on transport and buses, in particular, as there was Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate and there have been two other debates since then.</p><p>I welcome the debates, but I do not welcome the people we represent being used as political footballs because a council election is round the corner.

I remember listening to Radio Luxembourg, Radio Caroline and one that was quite close to my heart and possibly the hearts of others in my party: Radio Free Scotland, which was broadcast from under a pull-down bed in a single end somewhere in Glasgow. I will not tell the chamber whose house it was broadcast from. Those pioneers were very popular in their day, and I am so glad that we got round to giving such stations a licence and calling them community radio instead.</p><p>A number of stations have already been mentioned, but I would like to mention two in my Glasgow Kelvin constituency. Radio Awaz is absolutely fantastic; in fact, I should give it a plug and say that I have just sent a letter of support for its licence to be continued for the next five years. It does an excellent job not only on cultural diversity but in tackling other serious topics. For example, only a couple of weeks ago, it tackled forced marriage and got Nicola Sturgeon on to discuss the issue.</p><p>The other station in the Kelvin constituency that I want to mention is the fantastic Celtic Music Radio&#8212;[Interruption.] That was a slip of the tongue&#8212;I meant to say &#8220;Keltic&#8221;, not &#8220;Seltic&#8221;. They might well get some calls about that. The station broadcasts aspects of our culture as well as other serious issues, including politics. In fact, during the 2010 general election, it broadcast a programme on political protest songs with the suggestion that, instead of singing a protest song, people should just get out and vote. These two fantastic radio stations work very closely with the community.</p><p>I cannot finish without mentioning Sunny Govan Community Radio. As Annabel Goldie will know, having appeared on it herself, most of us from the area affectionately call it &#8220;Sunny Go-Van&#8221;. It is very close to the hearts of the people of Govan and does fantastic work not only in broadcasting to and serving the community, but in creating opportunities for people by training them and steering them perhaps towards a career in radio. Indeed, Elaine Murray, Nigel Don and Jim Hume made the same point about the community radio stations in their areas. I am not sure, though, whether the people of Sunny Govan get to chase after lost dogs and reunite them with their owners.</p><p>Finally, on opportunities, our Liberal Democrat colleague said that he knows a lot about radio&#8212;indeed, he does.

As colleagues have said, however, it is a short-term plan and we need a long-term plan. I hope that this debate will go some way towards helping to bring that to fruition.</p><p>I want to concentrate on the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding as people flee Syria to many of the middle eastern countries, Lebanon in particular.</p><p>Jim Eadie mentioned the Lebanese and Syrian people in the public gallery tonight. I met them earlier today, and they told me in couched terms about what is happening to the Syrian refugees who are in Lebanon. It has been said that something like 100,000 people have fled Syria. Some reports put the figure at 200,000. They have gone to other middle eastern countries apart from Lebanon, including Turkey and Jordan. From speaking to the Syrian people and some people who have had direct contact with Syrian refugees in Lebanon, I know that the problem is compounded by the fact that many of those who are fleeing are unwilling to register as refugees, so they are not counted as refugees. They are unwilling to register because they are frightened of being identified and of reprisals being carried out, not just against them, but against relatives back home in Syria. That is a real problem that we must look at.</p><p>In Lebanon, where some 20,000 people have fled to, the situation has been exacerbated by the failure of the Lebanese authorities to recognise the rights of the refugees, which is leading to many of them being unable to access medical treatment or food and water. Even if they are treated in hospital, they are discharged in a day or two. They do not have basics such as shelter.</p><p>As I said, I met some members of the Syrian community earlier. I feel that, alongside their efforts and the diplomatic efforts that are being made by our Government and others, we need to do something else to secure a peaceful solution to the current situation. I remind the cabinet secretary that, in the past, Scotland has always been ready to recognise when other people have needed our help. An example of that is our response to the Palestinian situation, when many organisations, MSPs, pharmacies and health boards got together to send medical aid to Palestine; I am sorry, but I get quite emotional when I think about what we did. I am talking about out-of-date prescription medication, tablets, equipment and so on, which we collected and sent to the Palestinian people. Perhaps we could show our solidarity with the Syrian refugees in Lebanon and elsewhere by starting a similar campaign, and I ask the cabinet secretary for her advice on that.</p><p>Among the charities and voluntary organisations in Scotland is Aid4All, which has just been set up. It wants to help to establish a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of humanitarian aid. Perhaps a meeting could be arranged with the cabinet secretary to talk about what it would like to do.</p><p>We need peace in the middle east.

Much may have changed in 60 years in Scotland and around the world, but the Commonwealth&#8217;s enduring principles, such as the promotion of democracy, human rights, liberty and world peace, are as relevant now&#8212;if not more so&#8212;as they have been at any time in the Commonwealth&#8217;s history.</p><p>This year&#8217;s theme&#8212;connecting cultures&#8212;also resonates with the times. In a world of increased globalisation, increased communication through news and social media and increased awareness of the world around us as a result, it is essential that we gain a comprehensive understanding of and a healthy respect for the wide variety of cultures in the Commonwealth and beyond.</p><p>The Queen&#8217;s message for Commonwealth day talks of the</p><p>&#8220;extraordinary cultural tapestry&#8221;</p><p>that makes up</p><p>&#8220;this unique gathering of nations&#8221;.</p><p>Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma talks of connecting cultures as encouraging us to</p><p>&#8220;explore how we can use culture to build bridges of exchange and understanding.&#8221;</p><p>In a world in which, each year, there are new challenges and new uncertainties, by celebrating our cultural diversity while building on basic rights such as equality and freedom, we can turn those challenges into opportunities and overcome our uncertainties. The Commonwealth is an ideal vehicle for achieving those aims. During the past 60 years, Commonwealth countries have worked together to improve the rights of many of its members across the world.</p><p>The changes have come about as the result of a collective approach and they have come about through the Commonwealth&#8217;s many programmes in a number of areas, such as women&#8217;s rights, democracy, education, and youth empowerment, amongst others. As we look to the future to see how such a collaborative approach can continue to deliver further positive change, CPA Scotland is playing its part.</p><p>The convener of the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Public Petitions Committee was recently invited to visit South Africa to address a conference about our positive committee. Many members and people in Scotland take the Public Petitions Committee for granted, but in many countries it would be unimaginable that people could write to Parliament and have it investigate and, where possible, offer solutions to issues, or that members could call Government ministers to account and bring debates to the floor of the Parliament. That is truly a wonderful achievement and we should share it. When I think about it, it sounds incredible, but the system works and many countries&#8212;not just those in the Commonwealth&#8212;want to replicate it. We should be proud of the positive contribution that we in the Scottish Parliament and the Scotland branch of the CPA make to the Commonwealth and beyond.</p><p>Sarah Boyack MSP is currently in Bangladesh, speaking about our world-leading climate change legislation, which I hope will be used to inform and shape other nations&#8217; responses to climate change. Scotland, and the CPA in Scotland, is sharing its knowledge and aspirations with many nations. Although they might have different cultures, they have at their hearts shared goals and a common purpose, and they are playing their part in connecting cultures.</p><p>I have mentioned MSPs. They might be the ones who are getting out and about and talking to people, but I also thank all the staff at the CPA Scotland branch in Parliament for their hard work and dedication. Without them, the branch would not be as dynamic and successful as it is. I give a special mention to Margaret Neal, CPA Scotland&#8217;s secretary, and congratulate her as I believe that she became a gran at the beginning of this week with the birth of baby Sam.</p><p>Special mention must be made of Malawi. We know that Malawi is experiencing difficult times at the moment, but the Scotland branch of the CPA retains a special relationship with Malawi, and we continue to work alongside elected members and members of the public there. Two interns from the National Assembly of Malawi are currently working in the Scottish Parliament. We continue to work with people in Malawi, and with elected members, with the help of the CPA Scotland branch secretariat.</p><p>The 2014 Commonwealth games in Glasgow must have a special mention, and not just because I am a Glaswegian and I represent the Kelvin constituency.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22663142", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Week 2012"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a privilege to open the debate to celebrate Commonwealth week 2012.

I am also grateful to be able to speak in the debate. As the cabinet secretary said, how we care for our elderly and vulnerable people is a reflection of the society in which we live. If we cannot care for our older people, that says something about our society.</p><p>The speeches that we heard from Duncan McNeil and others were excellent and raised some very good points. Malcolm Chisholm raised issues from his constituency and talked about the Elsie Inglis nursing home. However, I was disappointed in Jackie Baillie&#8217;s speech, as she seemed to use the committee debate as a political stage instead of trying to get to the nub of the committee&#8217;s report, which I understand was supported by all the parties that are represented on the committee&#8212;I commend them for that. Committee debates are important, and I look forward to the next one, in which I will also speak. It would be great if committee debates in the chamber were a regular feature so that committees had the opportunity to put forward what they have been looking at and the inquiries that they have been pursuing.</p><p>I am the convener of the cross-party group on older people, age and ageing, and the issue of care homes&#8212;their treatment of people, their staffing and the frequency of inspections&#8212;is raised often in that group, not just by members of the group but by individuals. I go out into my constituency and try to visit care homes, not just as most MSPs do, but as the convener of the cross-party group.</p><p>I am pleased that the Scottish Government has taken on board most of the recommendations in the committee&#8217;s report, particularly the recommendation on the frequency of inspections of care homes, which is an issue that individuals have raised on many occasions. It is important that visits are unannounced and that people know exactly what to expect.</p><p>Duncan McNeil mentioned whistleblowing, and that is something that we have to look at. Many staff desperately want to tell people what is happening in some care homes and the nastier aspects of it, but they are terrified to say anything. That is an important point and we need to look into it.</p><p>The training of staff is an important issue, and Mary Fee mentioned the need for fair wages. If we want decent staff, we have to give them a decent wage. We have to look at that also.</p><p>As we all know, the percentage of older people is growing, unfortunately. Perhaps we will get more younger people in, particularly with immigration, but we know that the propensity exists for older people to form the biggest population group in Scotland, so it is incumbent on us to ensure that our older people are looked after and cared for properly. After all, we will all be old one day. That is why it is important that the care of elderly people is properly regulated, that care homes are properly inspected, and that the legislation is in place to provide what older people want. After all, they are the ones who have to live with the consequences.</p><p>It gives me no pleasure to say that members would not want to live in, or even visit, some of the care homes that I have visited. We need to ensure that the regulations are watertight so that our older people can live in dignity. That is where the human rights issues come into the debate.</p><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate.

I think that the time has gone from seven minutes to eight minutes, but I have made a couple of additions to my speech, so I hope that I can look forward to taking eight minutes.</p><p>It has been an excellent debate. Like the previous debate this afternoon, it illustrates the breadth of issues and experiences with which parliamentary committees are involved. I congratulate the petitioner, Andrea MacArthur, on her tenacity in pursuing the issue and I thank the members of the Public Petitions Committee and the committee staff, as well as members of other committees, for their help and contributions.</p><p>Vitamin B12 deficiency has become a serious issue that deserves our attention and action by all agencies. Like Nanette Milne, Dr Richard Simpson spoke on the issue, and I bow to his knowledge of it; his speech was excellent. Vitamin B12 deficiency is closely related to pernicious anaemia and is an illness that has confused many GPs, largely because its signs and symptoms are often linked to a number of other illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis.</p><p>I commend John Wilson for raising in his speech the connection between MS and pernicious anaemia, the inconsistency of treatment and the fact that one size does not fit all patients. We need to consider that issue. Some health boards might produce a plan for a patient, but that does not necessarily mean that it will fit or suit all patients.</p><p>We must highlight the fact that the testing for vitamin B12 deficiency has not been as accurate or effective as it should be. A number of members made that point in their speeches. As I indicated, the testing frequently results in misdiagnosis. The minister said that the Scottish Government wants diagnoses of pernicious anaemia to be made as quickly as possible. I welcome that view and I will return to the minister&#8217;s closing speech later.</p><p>As the committee&#8217;s report indicated, the rates of vitamin B12 deficiency are far too high throughout Scotland. As the minister and Nanette Milne outlined, a number of groups are particularly at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, including those over the age of 60, people with an auto-immune condition and those with a family history of pernicious anaemia. Such people may be in need of medical treatment for the condition. In Northern Europe in total, one in 10,000 people is at risk of suffering from vitamin B12 deficiency. Such an incidence is far too high, so we must strive to promote awareness of the illness and work towards a credible solution for dealing with it.</p><p>As has been mentioned, a first step was taken in that regard by the debate in the Public Petitions Committee in November 2011, when Andrea MacArthur presented her petition on the issue of vitamin B12 deficiency and its treatment. Mrs MacArthur alerted me and a number of my colleagues to the issues regarding the identification and prevention of the disease. She has been a champion in the fight against vitamin B12 deficiency.</p><p>In the committee, we touched on many topics to do with vitamin B12 deficiency. The convener of the committee has already mentioned the lack of attention that is paid to the issue. Mrs MacArthur stated:</p><p>&#8220;Treatment of the condition is ... consistently bad&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Public Petitions Committee, 15 November 2011; c 228.]</p><p>The convener of the committee also raised that issue. Such a statement brings to light the fact that there really is a problem that demands our immediate, utmost attention.</p><p>Members have said that the committee received mixed responses from various health services. The response from NHS Highland&#8212;I think that Kenny Gibson mentioned it&#8212;was basically entirely different. It agreed that the issue deserved attention and that reform was needed, but Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board did not seem to sense the need to change the testing or medicine for vitamin B12 deficiency. It is rather strange that two NHS boards reached two different conclusions on a very important issue.</p><p>I want to touch on something that Kenny Gibson and Nanette Milne mentioned&#8212;I think that another member mentioned it, too. The lack of testing and misdiagnosis are important. People can have multiple illnesses, but they can be misdiagnosed. In his closing speech, the minister mentioned people who suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency and pernicious anaemia and have to go outwith their doctor&#8217;s surgery and access vitamin B12 injections from another source. That is worrying and telling.</p><p>The lack of acknowledgement from national sources prevents information from getting into the public domain and slows the spread of awareness about B12 deficiency. That is one of the key problems. As I mentioned to the committee&#8212;John Wilson raised a similar issue&#8212;one of my friends suffers from B12 deficiency. I do not think that she was aware of what was happening to her body and to other people. This debate is a fantastic first step in raising the issue of B12 deficiency and pernicious anaemia.</p><p>I have much more to say, but perhaps only a minute and a half in which to say it. I will therefore touch on the Schilling test, which Dr Richard Simpson mentioned. He said that the test was mentioned on the website of the Royal College of General Practitioners, but that it should have been taken off because it is no longer used. No accurate test has been used as a replacement. I think that Dr Simpson also mentioned the active B12 test. We could use that, and it is much cheaper. NHS Highland said that that would be a better way of going forward and acknowledging the problem with the current testing process. It accepts that</p><p>&#8220;the diagnosis of B12 deficiency is not foolproof&#8221;,</p><p>but that we should use the active B12 test. It said:</p><p>&#8220;The Active-B12 Test ... is clearly an interesting diagnostic test&#8221;.</p><p>I want to pick up on some of the issues that the minister raised in his closing speech. I welcome his comments, the fact that the chief scientist office would look forward to having input into more research&#8212;the petition proposes that&#8212;and his comments on the Pernicious Anaemia Society taking part in that. Patients should be at the centre of treatment&#8212;I have mentioned that before&#8212;although some patients have worries about that. The minister raised that issue.</p><p>I look forward to the updated guidelines. The minister mentioned that he would produce updated guidelines and speak to the Pernicious Anaemia Society. There is also the involvement of Healthcare Improvement Scotland.</p><p>The petition urges the undertaking of a review of the current situation. The minister has answered some of the questions. On behalf of the committee, I ask him to consider the petition further, and I look forward to the review of the current situation.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662509", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pernicious Anaemia and Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Understanding and Treatment)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

From television to radio broadcasting, they do a great job with what we have come to learn is very little. I make special mention of the poor souls at &#8220;Democracy Live&#8221;, who have the unenviable task of sitting through and sifting through every meeting of the Parliament and its committees. Our thoughts are with them.</p><p>I cannot say it too clearly: the work that BBC staff do is terrific. That is why the proposals, how staff are being treated and what they are being asked to do are a huge kick in the teeth. The delivering quality first project&#8212;that is true Birtspeak&#8212;aims to cut &#163;1.9&#160;million, or 16 per cent, from BBC Scotland&#8217;s news and current affairs budget over five years. In the first tranche of the cuts, a third of BBC Radio Scotland production staff will lose their jobs, which is staggering.</p><p>On top of that, programmes such as &#8220;Scotland at Ten&#8221; and &#8220;Newsweek Scotland&#8221; will be axed, which will lead to a reduction in overall quality, if not in the amount of politics coverage on Radio Scotland. The proposed cuts look bad enough, but the public are not being given all the facts. Four editorial posts have already been lost, which has led to a situation in which the programmes that we are told will replace &#8220;Scotland at Ten&#8221; and &#8220;Newsweek&#8221; are already seriously understaffed.</p><p>We are told that the rationale behind the cuts is the licence-fee freeze that the Westminster Government imposed, and that Scotland is just shouldering its share of the overall cuts. That is simply not true; Scotland is being singled out for deeper and faster cuts than will be made anywhere else in the UK, which is worrying. BBC Radio Scotland&#8217;s budget is due to be cut by 6.6 per cent and the budget for the Gaelic radio service is due to be cut by 6.7 per cent.</p><p>However, BBC Radio 4&#8217;s budget will not be cut, but will remain at &#163;99.5&#160;million. The budget for BBC Radio Wales will be cut by 3.2 per cent and for BBC Radio Ulster it will be cut by 1.6 per cent. BBC local radio in England will have a 4.2 per cent cut. I simply cannot understand why BBC Radio Scotland should receive larger cuts than BBC radio in any other part of the United Kingdom, especially at this time of unprecedented political debate on the future of our country. Although the political parties are unable to agree on which way to vote in the 2014 independence referendum, they all agree on the need for a full and frank debate on what independence will mean for the people of Scotland. The cuts will simply not help that.</p><p>The way in which the BBC is carrying out the cuts is equally troubling. It has announced changes, but it has not said what the changes will look like, and has given no details on the new two-hour Saturday &#8220;Good Morning Scotland&#8221;. There are fears that other programmes will be scrapped or downgraded because of the reduction in resources. There is also concern over the fact that the cuts are being rushed through on day 1 of what is a five-year strategy that is inappropriately called delivering quality first. It is no secret that the National Union of Journalists believes that the cuts to BBC Scotland&#8217;s radio news are fundamentally at odds with the BBC Scotland management&#8217;s stated aims to</p><p>&#8220;protect and enhance the quality of our core News and Current Affairs output across all platforms&#8221;</p><p>during what we could call the &#8220;delivering quality second&#8221; process.</p><p>I have received many letters from constituents asking the Scottish Government to make representations regarding the proposals and to ask the BBC to reconsider its current approach and proposals. For example, many people have questioned how axing a one-hour weekly show such as &#8220;Newsweek Scotland&#8221; could save much money when the proposal is to replace it with a two-hour &#8220;GMS&#8221;. Those questions are from listeners&#8212;the consumers&#8212;who are the very people that the BBC should listen to and serve.</p><p>As John Boothman, the head of news and current affairs for BBC Scotland, proudly pointed out when he gave evidence to the Education and Culture Committee in January, the corporation&#8217;s radio news coverage has an audience of 450,000 listeners, which is up 30,000 over five years. &#8220;Scotland at Ten&#8221; is listened to by 100,000 people each week, but what thought has been given to the provision of public broadcasting for that large amount of listeners? The BBC has a duty to provide for those 100,000 listeners. By removing the programme, it is failing in that duty.</p><p>To avoid further challenges, the BBC needs to issue clear evidence, at the earliest possible opportunity, of how the change does not contravene the guidance. At that meeting, Mr Boothman went on to laud the fact that BBC Radio Scotland broadcasts 63 hours of news and current affairs a week, which is well above the quota that is set by the BBC trust of 43 hours a week. For the life of me, I cannot see where those 63 hours come from, as that is a staggering nine hours a day. If Mr Boothman is tuning in or watching today, I would be grateful if he could let me and others know about that.</p><p>My colleague Joan McAlpine, who will speak later in the debate and who is a member of the Education and Culture Committee, had some pertinent points for the head of news and current affairs.

I was absolutely dumbfounded to hear that. It speaks volumes about how broadcasting in Scotland is viewed by senior executives in the BBC. To put it in context, what is being said is that, as Scotland has only a tenth of the population, programmes can be roughly a tenth of the quality. If I were to go to hospital or to access social services or any other public service, I would want the same service, no matter how much of the population there is in Scotland.</p><p>Staff are concerned about their future, because cuts have been announced but they do not know who the cuts will fall on.

As other members have done, particularly my colleague John Finnie, I put on record my concerns about the withdrawal of funding for the three specialist UKBA officers at Stranraer, which, as he eloquently said, is a strategic point. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s announcement of the close working among other agencies on the issue.</p><p>The Palermo protocol to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime states:</p><p>&#8220;&#8216;Trafficking in persons&#8217; shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs&#8221;.</p><p>The removal of organs has been mentioned. Although the public and media perception of trafficking perhaps centres on sexual exploitation, it is clear from the convention&#8217;s definition that trafficking encompasses a wide range of exploitative practices.</p><p>Trafficking is not a new phenomenon. For centuries, we have been blighted by the barbaric practice of slavery, which many people have put their lives on the line to stop. It is often mentioned as one of the great success stories of the modern era that, as a society, we confronted the issue and put an end to the practice. Unfortunately, as with many things in the modern day, that is simply not true. Perhaps we have done away with state-sponsored slavery but, more than 60 years after article 4 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights banned slavery and the slave trade worldwide, there are more slaves than at any time in human history. Conservative estimates put the figure at around 30 million, but many sources put it at 10 times that amount, which means a staggering 300 million people are being exploited in one way or another.</p><p>Until we send a clear message to those who are involved in any form of human trafficking or slavery, the numbers will continue to rise and more people will have to endure that truly horrendous crime. That is why the Equality and Human Rights Commission&#8217;s report is a wake-up call in the fight against human trafficking. It is disappointing that, as my colleague Roderick Campbell said, despite the fact that we have specific legislation that is aimed at tackling trafficking, when the report was produced, there had been only one successful prosecution in Scotland, while in England and Wales there had been more than 150.</p><p>In June last year, I asked the Lord Advocate why that was the case. He replied that, although there had been few prosecutions that were directly related to human trafficking, there had been other connected convictions for offences such as living off immoral earnings and fraud and for offences under the Identity Cards Act 2006 and the Immigration Act 1971. Although I do not doubt that any prosecution is to be welcomed, like my colleague John Finnie, I would like the prosecution service to give far more priority to gaining convictions for trafficking.</p><p>We will begin to win this battle only through making it clear to those involved that trafficking is unacceptable and that they will face the full force of the law for their crimes. The report states that Scotland should</p><p>&#8220;make it clear that it has established an environment which is totally hostile to trafficking and that&#8221;</p><p>all bodies</p><p>&#8220;are geared up to stamp it out.&#8221;</p><p>I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s announcement of a summit to bring together relevant agencies to consider the policy and its delivery. Mary Fee, Jenny Marra and Graeme Pearson all mentioned the Commonwealth and Olympic games. If there is any movement towards trafficking at either of those games, will the summit address what we can do about that?</p><p>I do not doubt the resolve and commitment of all those involved in the fight against human trafficking, but we must do better. We must do everything that we can to send out the clear message that Scotland does not tolerate any form of human trafficking and will use all the power at its disposal to convict those responsible. If that requires further legislation, as suggested by the report, I will welcome that legislation. I note the Scottish Government&#8217;s response that any bill would have to be considered alongside a wide range of other potential legislative priorities. I genuinely welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s announcement that the Lord Advocate will consider bringing in a statutory aggravated criminal offence for trafficking. I hope that it is recognised that that should be a priority. We need to act now.</p><p>Human trafficking is the fastest growing organised criminal activity in the world. The stories are horrific and harrowing, and it is happening here, today, in Glasgow and throughout Scotland. Legislation is the best way to tackle this crime and bring justice for the victims, and I would be happy to support, sponsor or introduce any consultation or legislation that might be required, should the Government be supportive of that approach. I will certainly support the Government on any legislation that it introduces to bring an end to this horrendous crime.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662015", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Human Trafficking"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate and I pay tribute to all those who are involved in the fight against the truly horrendous crime of human trafficking.

As the cabinet secretary said, Glasgow is designated as a UNESCO city of music and Edinburgh is designated as a UNESCO city of literature. Scotland is the only country to have two UNESCO-designated creative cities, which is a unique and fantastic feat for which we not only in the Scottish Parliament but in Edinburgh and Glasgow should pat ourselves on the back.</p><p>It is apt that, as we speak, musicians across Glasgow are tuning up their instruments and readying themselves for the start of Celtic Connections, which kicks off today. More than 200 artists from around the globe will come together at more than 300 events across the city. Celtic Connections has been very successful for more than a decade, and the key to its success is effective collaboration in different genres of music. An analogy can be applied to the Government&#8217;s approach. If we stretch the analogy, we could look at the Scottish cities alliance as a band with the Scottish cities knowledge centre, the action teams, the cities investment network and the leadership group all being members that feed into the final production, or the delivery group.</p><p>The cabinet secretary mentioned the make-up of the Scottish cities alliance and the interactions in it to foster innovation and collaboration and drive economic growth. I think that all members would endorse her comments.</p><p>Framework 2 in the cities strategy identifies the crucial role of capital investment in achieving sustainable economic growth. Central to that aim is the need to improve the ability to secure finance. The document goes on to state:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Cities Alliance, supported by the Cities Investment Network will&#8221;</p><p>work to</p><p>&#8220;create and promote strong investment propositions aligned to distinctive City Visions&#8221;.</p><p>It will also be charged with packaging and marketing those</p><p>&#8220;in a coherent Scotland wide way that is clear and accessible for international investment funds&#8221;.</p><p>Both of those points are undoubtedly welcome. That is a great example of the joined-up approach that I have already mentioned. We need to ensure that it runs through the Scottish Government&#8217;s strategy for cities.</p><p>The Scottish Government proposes using innovative funding mechanisms to secure further access to finance. It proposes using mechanisms such as the national housing trust and tax increment financing&#8212;or TIF, as we normally call it&#8212;which I would like to concentrate on</p><p>As a mechanism, TIF secures funding against future business rate income that will be generated by the resulting development. It was developed in partnership with the Scottish Futures Trust, and Scotland&#8217;s local authorities have estimated that it could be worth hundreds of millions of pounds and could generate more than 17,000 new jobs. I am sure that we would all welcome that.</p><p>In Glasgow, a current example of TIF funding under consideration is the ambitious project for the Buchanan Galleries, which will see new retail companies and restaurants and vast improvements to Buchanan Street bus station and Queen Street station, all the way down into Buchanan Street. Things will be joined together all the way along to Cathedral Street. I know that concerns have been raised about that TIF and the proposal that has been put forward.

I am probably one of the people she referred to when she mentioned people who play hockey or netball at school and then give it up. I used to do that many years ago, but I do not think that I could do so now&#8212;although perhaps we could set up a Parliament team.</p><p>I recently had the pleasure of visiting the new Commonwealth house in Glasgow&#8217;s merchant city, which is in my constituency of Kelvin. I was extremely impressed by the dedication and professionalism of the staff there and by the building itself, which, as well as embodying the ethos of the games, with its beautiful portrayals of all the 17 sports, is a great example of how the games will help ordinary people and businesses.</p><p>It is a great testament to the organisers that they made extensive use of Royal Strathclyde Blindcraft Industries, a social enterprise that employs disabled people to make high-quality furniture. They are also to be commended for employing veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to work on the renovation of Commonwealth house. The veterans were recruited through Glasgow City Council&#8217;s helping heroes campaign, which assists former soldiers in finding work. In addition, more than 40 young apprentices were employed as part of the renovation of Commonwealth house. As the minister said, on top of the physical legacy of the games, there will be an economic regeneration and job creation legacy.</p><p>Glasgow has a long history of events that have been intended to deliver a lasting legacy to the people of Glasgow and the city itself. Many members&#8212;with the exception, perhaps, of our younger members&#8212;may remember the Glasgow&#8217;s miles better campaign back in 1983, which was the year in which the internationally acclaimed Burrell collection opened. The Glasgow&#8217;s miles better campaign was one of the best and most successful promotions ever launched, and it won a New York international film and television award no fewer than four times between 1983 and 1987.</p><p>The campaign was launched in response to a lingering negative stereotype of Glasgow as a dangerous place that tourists did not want to visit, which ordinary Glaswegians were not particularly proud of. I remember the campaign well and the amazing effect that it had on perceptions of the city. Almost overnight, there was a tangible new buzz in Glasgow, as local people began to feel proud of their city and, internationally, people began to look at Glasgow as a vibrant modern city that embraced the future rather than looking to the past.</p><p>The campaign acted as a launch pad for a lot of rejuvenation in Glasgow and a new confident outlook. The garden festival that followed built on the campaign&#8217;s success and enhanced Glasgow&#8217;s reputation internationally. That was not the festival&#8217;s only legacy. The site, which is known as Pacific Quay, now houses the Glasgow science centre, the IMAX theatre and the BBC&#8217;s headquarters. Two years after the festival, one of the city&#8217;s most transformational events took place&#8212;Glasgow was named European city of culture 1990. Those celebrations showcased the very best of what Glasgow had to offer the world. Glasgow had been transformed and the recognition that it received throughout the world was phenomenal.</p><p>The 2014 Commonwealth games are the next step on the road. Once again, Glasgow will showcase itself to the world and deliver a lasting legacy for areas of the city that have not always benefited much from previous projects. The minister said that Glasgow 2014 will bring benefits not just for sport but for the economy. I am pleased that she announced an extension of sports hubs, in particular in the school estate. Such an approach is long overdue. People have constantly said, &#8220;We have school playing fields on our doorstep that should belong to the community, but we cannot access them.&#8221; The minister&#8217;s announcement is positive.</p><p>There will also be benefits from the building and renovation of sports grounds and buildings&#8212;I talked about Commonwealth house. I commend the partners who are involved for their collaborative approach to projects, but I ask them to reflect on the improvements that can be made to the surrounding areas. The minister is looking at me, so I will give a couple of examples. Thousands of visitors will travel through Kelvingrove underground station, in the west end, because many events will take place at Kelvingrove park and in the Kelvin hall. The station is in dire need of a significant facelift. Its entrance is in a bad state of repair, but that will be the first view that visitors get of the west end.</p><p>Partick, which is also in the west end of Glasgow, was the site of the first international football match, which took place between Scotland and England. The event could be celebrated during the Commonwealth games, perhaps by erecting a plaque&#8212;or whatever commemoration the community would like.</p><p>George Square is another example. Thousands of people will pass through the square and, to my mind&#8212;and to many Glaswegian minds&#8212;a makeover for the square is well overdue. A while back, the Glasgow Evening Times ran a competition to redesign the square, and readers submitted their ideas. Perhaps the paper will run the competition again.</p><p>I applaud the joined-up approach that agencies are taking to delivering a legacy for Glasgow and Scotland, which is paramount. Perhaps the minister will take on board and report back on some of my suggestions. We have a fantastic opportunity in Glasgow and in Scotland as a whole. We can go for gold, but in Glasgow we always reach further than people say that we will. With the Commonwealth games, Glasgow can reach for the stars.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657777", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games (Delivery and Legacy)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Patricia Ferguson on her new post and wish her well.

My concerns in that regard are well documented, so I will not reiterate them, but I will give an example of what happened to one of my constituents. I am sure that other members can talk about similar examples from their constituencies. An elderly gentleman was taken into hospital and it was decided while he was there that, because care services could not be provided for him, he could not go back to his home and should go into a care home. The family and others duly rallied round and looked for a suitable care home near them that met the gentleman&#8217;s needs, but it took months to find a suitable one. Not even a letter from the doctor, stating that the man&#8217;s health was deteriorating while he was in hospital, helped in getting the local authority to reach a decision on finding him a place in a care home.</p><p>Last week, Richard Simpson referred to a charter for whistleblowers. I found out that Glasgow City Council had a moratorium&#8212;or, I should say, ran a quota&#8212;on admissions to care homes every month only because someone in the health service told me about it. It is really important that we look at integrated care services and I entirely agree with Hugh Henry, who made an excellent speech, and other members that the biggest challenge that we face with the proposed health and social care partnerships is getting rid of the attitudes at the top. People at the bottom desperately want to help and integrate social care and hospital services but the problem lies with those at the top. The various partners have to work together because we simply cannot allow people to languish in hospital; that is costing the health board a fortune and it is happening only because some local authority wants to save money from its budget.

I think that this is the third motion that I have had debated in the same number of weeks.</p><p>To be ranked number 1 in any shape or form is always of great satisfaction, but to be ranked number 1 in the UK by students from around the world is a truly great result. Indeed, when it comes to numbers, the University of Glasgow, in my Kelvin constituency, is hard to beat. It is the fourth-oldest university, having been established in 1451, and is currently ranked among the top 100 in the world.</p><p>The University of Glasgow is also a member of Universitas 21, which is an international network of universities that was established as an international reference point and resource for strategic thinking on issues of global significance. The vision of Universitas 21 is indeed an ambitious one as it seeks to be the leading international network of research-intensive universities, working together to foster global citizenship and institutional innovation through research-inspired teaching and learning, student mobility, connecting students and staff and advocating internationalisation.</p><p>It is only fitting that the University of Glasgow should be a member of such a forward-looking and influential group, because the university was at the forefront of social change in the past as a major centre of the Scottish enlightenment in the 18th century and a pioneer in the 19th century in extending education to those outwith the upper classes. Not only should we be proud of that tradition, we should not lose sight of it and should ensure that it is at the core of not just the University of Glasgow&#8217;s values but those of other universities as they strive to grow in the 21st century.</p><p>Being part of the Universitas 21 group gives the university worldwide reach and appeal, as evidenced by the results of the international student barometer. Indeed, 96 per cent of international students agree that Glasgow is a good place to be, which is something that I, as someone who comes from Glasgow, could not agree with more. The university was also voted as having the number 1 online library in the UK and the number 1 sports facility. The University of Glasgow is also a member of the Russell group, which is a collaboration of 20 UK universities, of which 18 are in the top 20 in terms of research funding. In addition, in the international student barometer the university was voted as having the best learning experience in the group and was ranked first in terms of quality of lectures.</p><p>Taking all those figures together, we see that the University of Glasgow is number 1 in the United Kingdom and third across the globe. That is something of which we should be proud&#8212;and something which, of course, brings clear economic benefit not only to the city of Glasgow but to the whole of Scotland and the UK.</p><p>Such success not only brings economic benefit but adds to Glasgow&#8217;s diversity and cultural richness. The west end of the city has always been viewed as a diverse area, playing host to events such as the west end festival&#8212;which, with 600 events, is Glasgow&#8217;s largest&#8212;and the largest mardi gras outside London. Byres Road was shortlisted as a finalist in the greatest street in Britain awards&#8212;and I am sure that we will win that award next year. That success is partly due to the role that students and, indeed, international students play in making the area so vibrant, so rich and so cosmopolitan and we must do everything we can to ensure that it remains so.</p><p>I now wish to raise a few issues to which I hope the minister will respond in summing up. Although I believe that the future of Glasgow&#8217;s&#8212;and indeed Scotland&#8217;s&#8212;universities remains bright, I am concerned about the actions of the UK Border Agency and the effect of its changes to tier 4 visas on international students and, in turn, Scottish universities&#8217; hard-won reputation as centres of excellence. It has been estimated that the placing of restrictions on foreign students could be costing universities &#163;1 billion in fee income alone. To make matters worse, the UKBA, which advises the Home Office on how to impose the restrictions and cap such immigration, is itself deeply critical of the figures on which it relies, estimating that net immigration is probably more like half the figure stated in the international passenger survey. We need to look at that issue because those ill-thought-out and ultimately erroneous plans are harming Scottish universities&#8217; ability to attract and retain international students and Scotland&#8217;s economy, and I ask the minister to address that issue in summing up.</p><p>Higher education in Scotland is worth &#163;1.9 billion, employs 35,000 people and exports more than &#163;400 million-worth of services. It is, therefore, one of Scotland&#8217;s biggest service sector exporters. People do not realise that fact; we talk about universities as places of excellence and learning, which they are, but we should also be proud of the fact that they are one of our biggest service sector exporters&#8212;and exporters of knowledge, at that.</p><p>Given their rich history and contribution to Scottish society throughout the centuries, Scottish universities must be protected and enhanced to ensure that they continue to deliver for Scotland and help to shape future learning throughout the world. That is what Scotland&#8212;and the University of Glasgow in particular&#8212;is renowned for and I am very pleased to have secured this debate in Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657763", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: University of Glasgow"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have just noticed that the number of the motion is 1223.

It provides young people between the ages of 11 and 26 with information, ideas and incentives to become confident, informed and active citizens. I congratulate it on its work and its undoubted success as an organisation. The breadth of the information and help that it offers people is truly staggering&#8212;it ranges from how to set up a band, to advice on housing, relationships, getting a job and knowing legal rights.</p><p>The organisation is a great resource. The national entitlement card for young people, which offers them discounted travel and other discounts at more than 1,400 outlets throughout Scotland, has of course been popular. The card is part of the European youth card network, which provides more than 100,000 discounts in more than 40 countries. That is also popular.</p><p>Much of Young Scot&#8217;s work is about empowering young people, providing them with the necessary information to make informed decisions and choices and giving them the necessary tools to turn their ideas into action and to take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them. All that together helps young people to grow into confident and aspirational young adults.</p><p>Members might remember that we debated youth unemployment last Thursday. In the debate, I was keen to stress that many of the young people whom I meet in my constituency of Glasgow Kelvin are aspirational, ambitious, passionate about what they want to do and keen to participate fully in their communities and larger society. However, they sometimes feel that, rather than being listened to, they are pigeonholed at a young age, which has a negative impact on their confidence and outlook.</p><p>If we are to tackle some of the issues that young people have to deal with&#8212;be they unemployment or a feeling of being pigeonholed&#8212;we need to engage the young people, listen to them and help them to achieve what they want. The truth about youth project sets out to do exactly that. It aims to engage young people in highly practical activities in their communities that will make a great difference to those communities and to the young people involved.</p><p>Truth about youth is run by Young Scot and supported by the Co-operative Foundation, which I congratulate on and thank for its support. The project focuses on challenging negative perceptions of young people. It is being undertaken in Glasgow, but the negative perception that people sometimes have of young people is certainly not confined to Glasgow.</p><p>The project sets out to challenge such perceptions by supporting workshops that are created and delivered by young people, in which young people and adults can come together to gain a better understanding of the positive things that young people do. The workshops have been highly successful in bringing together young and old to gain a better understanding of one another through identifying stereotypes, encouraging understanding between generations and sharing stories of positive involvement in the community.</p><p>A blogging site called The Patter&#8212;&#8220;patter&#8221; is a good Glasgow word&#8212;has been set up to give everyone the opportunity to blog and share their thoughts on young people. A recent entry by Anon&#8212;a media studies student at Cardonald College&#8212;hit the nail on the head. Anon said:</p><p>&#8220;One common word used to describe young people nowadays is &#8216;lazy&#8217;. I bet you, if you are young, will have been called this word one time or another by older folk. But the question is, is it the truth or a complete misconception? For one, it is slightly unfair, as although there are a fair many young people who are genuinely lazy, a lot of them just have nothing practical to do. With the lack of jobs and lack of social activities in towns (e.g. ruined football pitches, closed sport or entertainment facilities etc), the only thing in my opinion which is available to young people now is chatting to each other on the internet, such as Facebook, or playing their games consoles all day. Or resort to becoming a NED which is sadly becoming more commonplace. So, while a lot of us are lazy, many of us are still called &#8216;lazy&#8217; very unfairly. If we have nothing to do, what can we do?&#8221;</p><p>That young person feels that young people are being painted in a negative light and the blog identifies the fact that we need to provide more opportunities for social and other activities.</p><p>I would like the lessons that have been learned and the experience that has been gained by the project to be extended across Scotland, and the Scottish Government to work with Young Scot to see that that happens. Perhaps the minister will look favourably on my request in summing up, as I believe that he understands the challenges that face younger people. Angela Constance once said:</p><p>&#8220;I probably didn&#8217;t really engage with education fully until I was about 14. Prior to that, I was a little disengaged. Not problematic, but disengaged.&#8221;</p><p>That probably sums up the feelings of some young people today.</p><p>I ask the minister to look favourably on Young Scot and its projects. As I said in my opening remarks, it is time for someone to stand up for the youth of this country against the negative publicity that they always get. A lot of good young people are out there and we should be praising from the rooftops Young Scot and what it brings to young people. If anyone from the media is in the gallery, I hope that they will pick up on that and engage with young people.</p><p>Perhaps the minister will tell us whether he will meet representatives from Young Scot and its projects in Glasgow, particularly in the east end, and look to rolling out that experience across the country. We want positive, aspirational and confident young people. We have such young people, but we just have to ensure that other people know that young people are not all lazy.

I can sum that up in one word.&#8221; Members can all guess that that one word is &#8220;independence.&#8221;</p><p>The issue that is being debated is complex. The motion is quite right to point out that all parties must work together to put forward the best solutions available to us at this time.</p><p>The Scottish Government has to an extent recognised this important issue and it is taking positive steps to address it. I welcome the First Minister&#8217;s announcement of a minister for youth employment. That is absolutely fantastic and I look forward to meeting and working with that minister.</p><p>As has already been said, provision was made in the spending review for a record 125,000 new modern apprenticeships over the next five years. We are committed to delivering 25,000 a year. It is important that, as the First Minister said, those apprenticeships will be linked to jobs.</p><p>At the SNP conference in October, the First Minister announced&#8212;I think that Iain Gray raised this point&#8212;that any new Government contract or grant will have an apprenticeship or training plan attached to it. We should all welcome that as it is essential for the future success of Scotland and its young people.</p><p>Chic Brodie mentioned the opportunities for all initiative. That is the commitment, which the First Minister mentioned, that every 16 to 19-year-old in Scotland who is not in a job will be offered a place in education or training or a modern apprenticeship. It is important to recognise that.</p><p>The Smith group began its report by welcoming the initiatives that the Government has put in place. It said:</p><p>&#8220;education and training must only be viewed as a means of gaining the skills that take a young person nearer to fulfilling employment.&#8221;</p><p>We must acknowledge that important point. The report suggests that we should not just consider statistics, temporary outcomes and piecemeal initiatives but have a fully joined-up approach. When we offer a training or college place or other initiative, we tend to forget that it might not necessarily suit the young person. We need to remember that one size does not fit all and that a young person might not want to go down a particular road. We should listen to what young people tell us about what they want to do.</p><p>I feel positive about the future, because the Scottish Government&#8217;s curriculum for excellence is designed to enable young people to identify what they want to do and to develop at their own pace the knowledge, understanding and skills that will meet their needs and aspirations. Members on the Opposition benches said that some young people who leave school at 15 or 16 do not have the necessary skills. That is perhaps a failing that the curriculum for excellence will address. Many young people do not want to stay on at school; they want to take a different direction, and that is up to them. The curriculum for excellence is in its infancy, but I think that it will be hugely successful if we listen to the right people&#8212;that is, to young people themselves.</p><p>For too long, many young people have not been given the opportunity to explore their potential. They have been pigeonholed and written off at a young age. That is sad, and it cannot be allowed to happen.</p><p>Members of the Opposition talk about a &#8220;lost generation&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Unemployment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I commend the Opposition for highlighting an issue that we all see as very important.

We must consider regeneration optimistically, as we can regenerate areas. We all know where those areas are, and a real change would benefit their communities. They want change, and it is up to us as elected members to give that to them.</p><p>I want to touch on a couple of issues that are obviously important, particularly in the Glasgow area.</p><p>The Commonwealth games will be a real catalyst for regeneration, not only in Glasgow but across Scotland. I hope that the minister will say something in his closing speech about community benefit clauses, which are being inserted into public contracts to ensure that local communities benefit from them. I fully support that interesting and innovative approach, but I would like to see more meat on the bones in relation to how it will work in practice.</p><p>As the minister knows, because I have raised the issue on numerous occasions, I am particularly interested in the community empowerment bill. I agree with him that community empowerment must come from the bottom up, not the top down. I heard what Alex Johnstone said, and, yes, we all need to work together. However, if communities are not involved and engaged, regeneration will not work. For too long, things have been thrown at communities&#8212;such as the sunshine industries that Duncan McNeil mentioned&#8212;without anybody asking the people on the ground what they wanted and how they would get involved.</p><p>The community empowerment bill is one of the most important bills in this session of Parliament. I look forward to seeing more meat on the bones of the bill and to working with the Government and with local communities on it.</p><p>Tax increment financing provides a golden opportunity for cities. The Glasgow Kelvin constituency, which I represent, covers the city centre, the merchant city and the vibrant west end area of Glasgow. It could really benefit from that finance. Glasgow City Council is putting forward a business case&#8212;I think it is for &#163;80 million&#8212;for such funding for the Buchanan quarter. I do not say this lightly, but there have been some concerns about that TIF scheme. I plead with the council to listen to those concerns. I also hope that they will have no adverse effect, regardless of what the council proposes to the Government, because we desperately need such finance to be put into city centres, as it will raise areas up.</p><p>Duncan McNeil mentioned Inverclyde docks; I would like something to be done about the waterfront area on the Clyde as well. We should bring such derelict areas back into use so that all the communities can use them and businesses can locate there. I would like that to be considered for a future TIF scheme, if not the one that Glasgow City Council is proposing now.</p><p>I am pleased to speak in the debate.

My colleague Bill Kidd will concentrate on the nuclear aspect and I will concentrate on the humanitarian and human rights side.</p><p>It is a great honour and sadness to bring the motion before the Scottish Parliament. It is an honour to highlight the enormous courage and conviction of a man who put aside thoughts of his own personal safety to expose to the world the true extent of Israel&#8217;s secret nuclear arsenal. It is a sadness to note that 25 years have passed since Vanunu&#8217;s conviction for treason, in which time he was held in solitary confinement for 11 years, and that he still suffers persecution in Israel today, not being allowed to speak to anyone outwith Israel. Obviously, the present restrictions on him were put in place simply because he happened to speak to someone who was not an Israeli citizen.</p><p>Since his release, Vanunu has been subjected to harassment, intimidation and restrictions on his freedom that Amnesty International has described as cruel, inhuman and degrading and that have been condemned by not only the European Union but the United Kingdom Government. His treatment breaches his fundamental human right to freedom of expression and movement. It also breaches the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which includes the right to leave one&#8217;s country, alongside the right to freedom of expression. Let us not forget that the state of Israel is a party and signatory to that treaty.</p><p>It is our duty, not only as members of the Scottish Parliament but as honest, decent people, to support those who have suffered a breach of those fundamental rights and those who have been persecuted, and who continue to experience persecution, regardless of where they are or the state that is persecuting them.</p><p>Scotland and its people have a proud history of standing up against injustice and speaking out without fear in defence of those who need to be defended. The people of Scotland want those traditions and values to be reflected in this, their national Parliament.</p><p>Although what we say may not immediately lead to an end to the persecution of Vanunu and others, it will reinforce Scotland&#8217;s empathy with those who suffer and our long-held traditions of equality and justice very far into the Parliament&#8217;s future. If some of us&#8212;perhaps those who are not in the chamber&#8212;were not to recognise that fact and to believe erroneously that, as a devolved Parliament, we cannot speak out on such matters, it would be a great shame and a disservice to those whom we represent, who firmly believe in equality, human rights and freedom of speech.</p><p>We cannot reserve or devolve the right to speak out against injustice, and no one body has the moral authority on what is right or wrong. It is for us all to be guided by what we know to be right and to speak out when we know that something is not right. It is right for Vanunu to be allowed to leave Israel and live peacefully in one of the numerous countries that have offered him residence. It is also right for us to speak out against his treatment.</p><p>As the motion says, Mordechai Vanunu has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize 17 times. His only desire is to be allowed to leave a country where he is being persecuted and to live a peaceful life free from persecution.

However, like all members and the public, I believe that it is important that we take forward the issues of attainment and confidence in our young people. Early intervention starting from a very young age is important.</p><p>I hear what Ken Macintosh says about the nurture groups that Glasgow City Council has provided. I agree that they are fantastic, and I know that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning has also praised them. We do not always disagree on aspects of work that is done by councils. We did disagree with Glasgow City Council when, while other councils were reducing class sizes, it was the only council in Scotland that did not do that. I was disappointed about that, because nurturing and educating the kids of our country is one of the most important duties that we have as elected politicians. I agree with Mr Macintosh on certain aspects, but I cannot agree with him on others.</p><p>Both the minister and Derek Mackay mentioned parenting, which is critical in influencing how children approach not just education but their later years in life. I think the minister has got it right. She mentioned all-encompassing parenting classes. It is not a question of interfering, because it is a fact that many parents want to be looked at not as separate entities but alongside their kids, and to be helped to educate their kids.</p><p>I reiterate Derek Mackay&#8217;s point about early intervention. As far as I am concerned, early intervention is the key, particularly in the earliest years. That point has been made by John Downie of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and by Sally Ann Kelly of Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland, who said:</p><p>&#8220;It is only through effective early prevention work that we can avoid poor outcomes for Scotland&#8217;s children and young people in later life.&#8221;</p><p>If the acting director of Barnardo&#8217;s Scotland says that, I think that we are doing something right.</p><p>Statistics from the Scottish household survey show that parents&#8217; satisfaction with their children&#8217;s education is high. When people were surveyed about schools and the attainment of their kids, more than 90 per cent of parents said that they were very satisfied with the education that schools provide. We may criticise certain aspects, but in some areas we are getting things right. I am not saying that everything is perfect, but things are improving. We have to work harder to push forward, but we are getting there and we are getting on with it. I am not asking for praise, but the Minister for Children and Young People and her team are working hard to push forward the education system in our country.</p><p>I want to veer away from the education aspect and look at other forms of attainment and ambition in a slightly different way. We could do with more positivity and encouragement, particularly from the Labour benches. I do not particularly want to be political, but I have to agree with my colleague George Adam. It is important that we encourage our kids, but if all that we get from politicians is negativity, it does not do much to encourage attainment and positivity. Perhaps members on the Labour benches should look at themselves&#8212;not just members who have spoken in this debate, but those who spoke in last night&#8217;s debate, as well. If we want to encourage our kids to be positive and to do well, we must lead by example. Constantly running them down does not work at all.</p><p>Of course, it is not just politicians or Opposition parties who are to blame; the media play a role in this respect. Not all young kids are bad; in fact, many contribute greatly to society. For example, I am proud to say that Glasgow is the only part of Scotland to have picked up the cudgel of the Co-operative Foundation-funded truth about youth programme, which aims to challenge people&#8217;s perceptions of young people and to make it clear that not everything about young people is negative and that they actually make a positive contribution to society.</p><p>Education is, of course, very important, but we must consider how young people are perceived in the media and by the general public. Indeed, more emphasis should be put on that in, for example, the good citizenship programme. Nevertheless, the fact is that young people sometimes get bad press. We are doing our best through education to ensure that young people can meet the challenges that face them, but perhaps certain people in the media and elsewhere should be educated in the good things that young people do. It is not all bad.</p><p>The debate has generally been good. Of course, we will never agree on everything, but it is important that we work together to ensure that our young people are encouraged to attain their full potential. If they cannot look to elected members for that, I do not know where else they can look.</p>", "hdate": "2011-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22653253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Raising Attainment and Ambition (Young People)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not a member of the Education and Culture Committee, although I know that a number of members in the chamber are.

He was absolutely correct. There are certainly challenges in further and higher education. There are particular challenges at the University of Glasgow and the University of Strathclyde, in my constituency of Glasgow Kelvin. I will concentrate on the situations at those universities. The cabinet secretary is aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the institutions and I thank him for the work that he has done and is doing on the matter. He has met me on numerous occasions and he has met students and staff. I think that we are moving on and things are happening, but I hope that we can push on and that the cabinet secretary can update me on what is happening.</p><p>I sincerely welcome today&#8217;s announcement, which came as a real surprise, of a wider package of reforms in higher education&#8212;in particular, the very welcome setting up of a panel to review governance in universities. The issue has been at the forefront of all my discussions with university students, staff and principals at Glasgow, Strathclyde and elsewhere. I ask the cabinet secretary whether the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council will be involved in the review. I know that I have sprung that question on him, but I think that the funding council has a great role to play in the courses that the higher education sector offers and I would like to know where it fits into the review.</p><p>On the situation at the University of Glasgow, I have met staff, students and the principal and I think that we are making some progress. However, there is still great concern about courses in Slavonic languages. The university court will sit on 22 June, when it will make a decision. I know that it is not in my remit or within my power to demand that courses not be axed, but I make a plea to the court to listen to all the concerns that have been expressed, not just by me but by staff and students, and to consider sincerely any changes that it is thinking of making in relation to Slavonic languages. As Scotland pushes ahead in the world with an international outlook, and given that we are one of the worst countries in the world for learning languages, it seems to be perverse that the university is talking about cutting a course that is held in high esteem. The only other such course is in London. I cannot make this plea to the cabinet secretary, but if members of the university court are listening I urge them to give serious consideration to all the issues that have been raised and not to axe the courses about which concern has been expressed.</p><p>Members have mentioned the University of Strathclyde. I have met all concerned parties&#8212;staff, students and the principal&#8212;on numerous occasions. I felt completely educated last week, because I had a meeting at the University of Glasgow on the Monday and at the University of Strathclyde on the Tuesday. As is the case with Glasgow, I think that things are moving on at Strathclyde and that partnership is developing. I sincerely hope that we move in the right direction. However, there remain concerns about proposals to cut courses; geography and sociology were mentioned, and the faculty of humanities and social sciences is under threat, as is the community education department, which reaches out to the more deprived areas of Glasgow and beyond. We really need to look at that.</p><p>Maybe I am putting the cabinet secretary on the spot, but I wonder whether he can give us an update on what is happening at Strathclyde. As I said, I have spoken to everyone involved and we are moving in the right direction, but it would give comfort to people who are taking or applying to take courses to know what is happening.</p><p>An area that has not been covered in the debate is the situation to do with visas for overseas students, which has a direct effect on funding for our universities&#8212;I think that Liz Smith mentioned that. The UK Border Agency&#8217;s actions are having a detrimental effect on the ability of overseas students to come to our universities.</p><p>As I represent Glasgow Kelvin, which contains more universities and colleges than any other constituency in Scotland, I ask the cabinet secretary whether he has had any talks about the matter with the UK Border Agency or the relevant UK ministers. The principals have told me on many occasions that they are suffering because of the position of the UK Border Agency and Westminster, which means that some foreign students cannot get visas to study here.</p><p>I hope that the cabinet secretary can respond to the questions that I have raised when he sums up.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648601", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Education and Lifelong Learning"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The cabinet secretary started by talking about the current challenges and the need to work in partnership.

I also congratulate you, Presiding Officer, on your new position.</p><p>It is good to be here making my maiden speech as the constituency member for Glasgow Kelvin. [Applause.] Thank you. I intend to make a positive speech, but I must say that I was pretty disappointed by Jackie Baillie&#8217;s speech and, to an extent, by Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s speech. Perhaps the Labour Party should remember that it did not win the election, and perhaps there should be a label that says, &#8220;Labour is bad for your health.&#8221; It was Labour&#8217;s negative campaigning that lost it the election. I pay tribute to the SNP&#8217;s team and I pay tribute to the cabinet secretary for her commitment and positive attitude to the wellbeing of the people of Scotland.</p><p>The cabinet secretary said that she is new to her role as cities minister, so perhaps she has not got round to looking at some of the issues that I will mention, but I hope that she will pick up on some of my suggestions in the debate that we will have on the cities strategy.</p><p>As I said, I am the constituency member for Glasgow Kelvin, which is a hugely diverse area. It includes Glasgow city centre and areas that continue to grow and flourish, bringing improvements in health and wellbeing, as many members have said. Alongside those areas are areas that perhaps have not had the same opportunities, and I look forward to working with the cabinet secretary to improve those areas and to bring them up to the level that should be achieved, not just in Glasgow Kelvin but throughout Scotland.</p><p>We have heard about tangible issues to do with health and wellbeing, which we can measure, such as waiting times and alcohol abuse, but there is more to health and wellbeing than that. It is about having flourishing communities in which local businesses can grow and in which people can take pride in their neighbourhoods and have a say in the future direction of the community. That is important for people&#8217;s health and wellbeing.</p><p>The question is how we achieve such flourishing communities. One of the most powerful ways of doing so is through community empowerment. The Scottish Government proposes to introduce a bill on community empowerment and renewal, to achieve just that. The cabinet secretary said that the details are still to be worked out, but will she tell us whether the bill will play a part in her strategy for the regeneration of our cities?</p><p>In &#8220;Building a Sustainable Future: Regeneration Discussion Paper&#8221;, the Scottish Government said that as a priority for 2011-12 it will</p><p>&#8220;Continue to support our Urban Regeneration Companies&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;Continue to invest in vacant and derelict land&#8221;.</p><p>Such investment is fundamental to improving communities and thereby improving health and wellbeing.</p><p>I am sure that if I asked members around the chamber whether they could think of a piece of land in their constituency that is underused or derelict and could be put to better use, they would immediately be able to think of a number of examples. I can certainly name a number of them, but I will not do so because of time constraints. However, there is an example in my constituency that some people may know of, particularly Patricia Ferguson&#8212;the old public baths building at the bottom of Byres Road, which has been raised as an issue on many occasions. It is in a well-known area of the west end and has been left to fall into a disgraceful state of disrepair. That has had a huge adverse impact on people and small businesses there&#8212;not just on older people who remember it as the baths&#8212;because it is a small part of the bottom of Byres Road that is lying derelict.</p><p>I undertook a survey during the election period and afterwards to see whether we could do something about this eyesore, because it is driving away investment in that area of Glasgow Kelvin. Businesses and people in the area say that they would love it to be regenerated, perhaps for housing or a community facility. People also ask why they cannot have a huge market there, with fresh food and vegetables, and so on. People all say that the building detracts from that area of the community. The bottom line is that people there desperately want something to put in its place. I wonder whether the cabinet secretary, who is responsible for cities strategy, can let me know in her summing up speech whether communities could take ownership of such buildings or land.</p><p>In May, Scotland&#8217;s six cities&#8212;we hope that there will soon be seven&#8212;signed a joint statement of their shared vision for Scotland&#8217;s success. It pointed to the fact that our cities need innovative finance and investment models&#8212;I think that Patricia Ferguson touched on one of them&#8212;such as tax increment financing and social impact bonds. We will hear more about the borrowing powers in the Scotland Bill when it is debated. I hope that such areas will be looked at. I think that Bob Doris also mentioned the JESSICA fund.</p><p>I want to be positive about this issue; I do not want to make negative comments about it. All parties must work together and recognise, as Patricia Ferguson said, that our cities, particularly Glasgow, are the powerhouses for generating the economy and employment. We need to ensure that we get extra monies, such as tax increment financing and social impact bonds, into our cities to ensure that they create employment for the people who live there and that not only Glasgow but Scotland as a whole flourishes.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jim Eadie on and thank him for his excellent and informative speech, which got to the nub of the debate about health and wellbeing.

I in no way want to dilute or take anything away from the bill but, like Ted Brocklebank, I believe that the bill could be a precursor to legislation on other matters.</p><p>I want to raise the issue of common good funds, on which the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee took evidence. Paragraph 79 on page 16 of the committee&#8217;s stage 1 report states:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee received a small number of submissions suggesting that the Bill offered an opportunity for Scottish Ministers to legislate to provide for the establishment of a common good asset register.&#8221;</p><p>That mentions &#8220;a small number&#8221; but, at a meeting that I attended in Glasgow city chambers, a large number of community council representatives&#8212;about 200&#8212;were present from throughout the region. On all their lips was the point that they cannot find out anywhere exactly what common good assets their councils have or which assets have been disposed of. There was overwhelming anger at that meeting regarding common good funds and the lack of accountability or information on common good assets.</p><p>It is not only community councillors and members of the public who are saying that; members of all parties have raised the issue in the Parliament. I have raised it, as has Robert Brown of the Lib Dems. Mary Scanlon has raised it on numerous occasions. Her most recent contribution was to ask about guidance that has been issued to local authorities on common good records and funds. The answer that she received from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth stated:</p><p>&#8220;the Scottish Government wrote to all local authorities in 2007 to remind them of their responsibilities under accounting codes of practice, best value guidance grant conditions and statute in respect of their management of common good funds and assets.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Written Answers, 12 February 2010; S3W-31278.]</p><p>Even today, people still do not know what assets are held and what has been disposed of.</p><p>Paragraph 83 of the committee&#8217;s report states that the bill is not the proper place to deal with common good funds, but it also states:</p><p>&#8220;The Committee would expect, however, that local authorities&#8217; RMPs established under the Bill would include information on how existing records relating to common good assets were to be managed.&#8221;</p><p>I ask the minister to consider that recommendation. Do ministers intend, as part of the process of the bill, to issue further guidance or even to monitor the RMPs that are established under the bill, in relation to common good funds and assets that are held by local authorities?</p><p>I have received a huge list of the assets that local authorities have declared, although they do not have to declare them. It is amazing&#8212;it includes streets, shops and bailies&#8217; chains. Every year in Glasgow, we have a pensioners Christmas party, which is paid for out of the common good fund. I found that out only because I asked, but most people do not know that. It might be simple, but the public want to know exactly what common good assets their councils hold, what they have disposed of and how much money is held in common good funds.</p><p>I do not want to dilute the bill in any way and I fully support what it stands for. However, I want to put down a marker regarding common good funds.

As everyone else has said, science centres are fantastic. All the science centres that have been mentioned&#8212;Dundee Science Centre, Our Dynamic Earth, Satrosphere in Aberdeen and the Glasgow Science Centre&#8212;do a wonderful job of not only ensuring that science is available to school children, the general public and tourists but making science interesting and fun. That encourages young people, in particular, to attend classes in the science centre.</p><p>As Willie Coffey said, Glasgow Science Centre does outreach work, and I know that other science centres do the same. Many a time I have wandered through George Square when Glasgow Science Centre has been doing outreach work and it has been queued out with young people wanting to see the experiments. That is an important part of the work that science centres do. The staff show great enthusiasm when the schoolkids and others come along. Given such enthusiasm, I hope that the young people who visit Glasgow Science Centre&#8212;some are from schools, and some are so young that they are from nurseries&#8212;will look upon science as a career.</p><p>Pupils and teachers who recently travelled to Geneva to visit CERN&#8212;the European Organization for Nuclear Research&#8212;to see top scientists in action said that they found it very rewarding. I mention, in particular, a pupil, Alison Tully, and Clare Hayes, the head of the faculty of science at Hyndland secondary school in Glasgow, who were fortunate enough to attend CERN along with eight other pupils and Mike Russell, who thought that it was a fantastic opportunity for them. Alison is now going to go on to study physics at university. That tells us something about the joy that they got from not only the science centre but the outreach work that science centres do. I also praise Mike Russell, who has been very good at pushing science forward.</p><p>I have often visited Glasgow Science Centre with my family and friends, and I have to concur with everything that Willie Coffey says. The centre offers a unique experience and is very welcoming. He is very knowledgeable on the subject, and will know that Glasgow Science Centre works closely with Ayrshire. Indeed, Glasgow&#8217;s &#163;50,000 share of the science centre transport fund has a caveat that 50 per cent of it must go to Ayrshire to ensure that people from that area are brought into Glasgow Science Centre. The caveat also states that some of the rest of the fund has to go to deprived areas. Willie Coffey is right that it is important that everyone gets the opportunity to visit the science centre. It cannot just be for people with money; everyone must be able to get involved. I believe that the transport fund may be increased to &#163;80,000 now that the budget has been passed. I look forward to the minister confirming that&#8212;perhaps not today but later. Every school-age child should be able to visit a science centre, so I urge all local authorities, science centres and the Government to get together to ensure that every school-age child has a chance to do so.</p><p>I will raise a couple of issues with the minister and perhaps she can get back to me on them. This is not the case at the other science centres, but Glasgow Science Centre has responsibility for the cost of the quay walls in the Clyde and for opening up the Millennium bridge. Whenever a boat needs to go under it, the science centre is called and has to open it up. Those anomalies have existed for a number of years, and I would like someone to have a look at them. I raised the issue with the previous Government and have done so with the current Government. I spoke to the people from Glasgow Science Centre today and those two anomalies, which cost time and money, still exist.</p><p>I do not want to end on a negative note, because the science centres do a fantastic job&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2011-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22644207", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Science Centres"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Joe FitzPatrick for securing this debate.

It has been noted. I also pay tribute to my colleague Bashir Ahmad, who felt strongly about the issue&#8212;I think that we all know that&#8212;and who led a Government debate on the subject in this very Parliament in 2008. He was clear in his speech in that debate and in the many conversations that I had with him about the issue that arranged marriage with the consent of all is not to be confused with forced marriage. That message has come across well in today&#8217;s debate.</p><p>I congratulate the Equal Opportunities Committee, of which I was a member for a number of years, on its work on the bill. As other members have pointed out, the issue is very emotive. It is not always easy to put emotions to one side when considering legislation, but the Equal Opportunities Committee has managed to do so very successfully.</p><p>One thing that we must remember is that although, as the minister has said, the problem predominantly affects women, it can also affect men. Indeed, I was reminded of that fact by a number of young men who spoke to me after a debate on the subject in which I participated in Glasgow city chambers.</p><p>Abuse in forced marriages can take many forms: rape, domestic violence, beatings, forced slavery and the victim&#8217;s inevitable feeling of helplessness. Perhaps the worst aspect is that the helpless people who are subjected to that continual violence and abuse are also cut off from the outside world and from help; basically, they have been abandoned by the vast majority of the community. I simply do not know how they manage to cope with having to live in such a terrible atmosphere. Anne McLaughlin was very articulate in highlighting the situation that was faced by one of her constituents, but there are many more such people out there.</p><p>We need to get what is a very forward-looking bill right for the victims. I sincerely hope that it gives people the courage to come forward to get the help and guidance that will be provided. I note and welcome the minister&#8217;s comments in that respect.</p><p>The UK forced marriage unit has stated that in 2009 it dealt with 375 actual forced marriage cases. Up until 2009, approximately 10 per cent per year&#8212;or, under the 2009 figure, 40 cases&#8212;involved people from Scotland. As Malcolm Chisholm and others have pointed out, that might not seem like a huge number, but given the population differences between England and Scotland, that 10 per cent is quite a large number for a country the size of Scotland. As a result, I ask the minister whether during the bill&#8217;s passage and when it comes to fruition, the number of cases, which I hope will not rise, will be monitored.</p><p>Finally, with regard to section 2(3)(g), the Law Society of Scotland has said that,</p><p>&#8220;given that forced marriage legislation is already in place in England and Wales it would suggest substituting &#8216;United Kingdom&#8217; with &#8216;Scotland&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>Is the minister seeking to amend the bill to follow that recommendation or will it be up to members to do so?</p><p>I think that we all agree that we need to do something about forced marriages, and I welcome the contributions that have been made by members of all political parties.

I have long campaigned for and supported the tightening up of HMO licences, as other members have done. Like other members, I deal with a great number of cases relating to the granting of HMO licences and the problems that that causes. Pauline McNeill eloquently set that out.</p><p>Glasgow has a vast proportion of HMOs, particularly in the Hillhead area and in other parts of the west end, so we desperately need to deal with the issue. Page 11 of the Scottish Parliament information centre briefing on the bill mentions that three quarters of HMOs are concentrated in four local authority areas&#8212;Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow. Those are all university cities. The city that I represent, Glasgow, has three universities and numerous colleges and it has many HMOs and private lets.</p><p>I will return to that issue, but first I will mention the tenancy deposit scheme, which John Wilson talked about and which will come into effect in March this year. That is welcome, and I know that the National Union of Students welcomes it very much. I have had many representations&#8212;as have other members, I assume&#8212;from tenants who have had their deposits withheld by letting agents but have been given no good reason for that. We have challenged that head on. I hope that, in future, such tenants will get their money back. I have long campaigned for such a scheme. Away back in the 1999 election and in the election preceding that, I and other members who are present campaigned to get a tenancy deposit scheme. I thank the minister for pushing forward the scheme, which I am sure will be welcomed in various areas.</p><p>Some members have criticised the bill for not going far enough. I agree that we have to consider it at stage 2, and I am sure that amendments will be made. As members have said, the landlord registration scheme is to be welcomed. However, other members, including Mary Mulligan, representing the Labour Party, have said that the bill does not go far enough and is not good enough. Mary Mulligan will have a chance to lodge amendments at stage 2. I certainly look forward to seeing the amendments that she lodges. We should not completely rubbish the bill at stage 1.</p><p>The debate has been consensual and the speeches from members have been good. Basically, we are trying to work together with all parties, so perhaps Mary Mulligan was a wee bit out of synch with the other members who have spoken. The bill should be welcomed. After all, the current Government has not been in power for long, but her party was in government long before that and did not propose various measures. I am not being disingenuous, but the member should think carefully when we are having a consensual debate. The bill is the right move and members can lodge amendments at stage 2. I look forward to seeing those amendments&#8212;I might lodge some, too.</p><p>To return to the subject of HMOs, all members will have visited such properties. I certainly have, and I have seen good ones and bad ones. We need new legislation to tighten up the link between planning and licensing of HMOs. I have met councillors in Glasgow and officials in the council planning department. As Pauline McNeill said, we need an assurance that councils that do not grant an HMO licence will not be taken to court. Will the bill tighten up that link? Will potential HMOs need planning permission before they become HMOs? We also need to look at how we deal with HMOs that were granted a licence previously. We need assurances on that.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson and Pauline McNeill mentioned the petition. I add that some properties cannot be partitioned viably. I have been in a property that we in Glasgow would call a room and kitchen, but which is being advertised as a two-bedroom flat simply because the main room has been partitioned down the middle to make space for two bedrooms. What I would have called, many years ago, a hole-in-the-wall bed, has been turned into a kitchen. The landlord is charging &#163;600 or &#163;700 a month for what is basically one room rather than a two-bedroom flat.</p><p>We have to look at situations such as that in order to protect not just the tenants who move into HMOs, but the other residents of the buildings. We have heard about numerous complaints&#8212;Jim Tolson mentioned Hillhead community council, charities and others. Sometimes people&#8217;s lives are made absolute hell when an HMO is right next to them and that property&#8217;s kitchen is next to their bedroom. The occupants of the HMO might be cooking, or up all night, when their neighbour is trying to sleep.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson mentioned building control, which is an important part of the picture. We need building control, planning and the licensing teams of local councils to work together to ensure that tenants have a decent home to live in and that residents can also live in peace.</p><p>As others have mentioned, we need to look at making enforcement robust.

That is very telling because, as has been mentioned, the issue is one of human rights.</p><p>Before I discuss the issue from a Scottish perspective, I want to draw to members' attention some chilling facts in relation to violence against women on a global scale. One third of women are affected by violence globally, in some cases on a scale that is simply unimaginable.</p><p>Violence against women encompasses all forms of violence, not only domestic violence. It is perpetrated, especially in the form of rape, to destroy communities, discourage any form of resistance and&#8212;as in the war in Yugoslavia&#8212;to conduct ethnic cleansing.</p><p>In Liberia, it is estimated that a staggering 75 per cent of women were raped during the conflict. In Rwanda, between 250,000 and 500,000 women were raped during the genocide, and a decade later, 67 per cent of the survivors are HIV positive.</p><p>A number of members have raised the issue of trafficking, which is another form of violence perpetrated against women in which there has <place-holder colnum=\"31930\"/> been a huge increase in recent years. The harrowing stories of women who have been trafficked and forced into prostitution and servitude are truly horrific.</p><p>Although we are doing something about that, I do not believe that enough is being done to tackle trafficking. We must do more to educate people not only in this country, but in the countries from which the women are trafficked. We must inform society that the trade in human suffering cannot be allowed and is not acceptable.</p><p>Violence against women has many different forms and origins, but the perpetrators share a similar perception: that violence against women is in some way acceptable. The aim of many campaigns is to change that perception, and Johann Lamont touched on that in her contribution. If we are to change that perception, we need to have a serious debate about how it is formed in the first place and tackle it at the root, before it manifests itself in violence.</p><p>The Scottish Government states in \"Safer Lives: Changed Lives\" that its approach is informed by the definition that was developed by the national group that was set up after the United Nations declaration on the elimination of violence against women. It defines violence against women as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a function of gender inequality, and an abuse of male power\".</p><p>As a result, the definition encompasses</p><p class=\"indent\">\"actions that result in physical, sexual and psychological harm or suffering to women and children, or affront to their human dignity\".</p><p>Interestingly, the definition includes sexual exploitation through prostitution and pornography and acknowledges that activities such as prostitution, stripping, lap dancing, pole dancing and table dancing are forms of commercial sexual exploitation. I and others have raised those issues time and again in the Parliament and we will continue to do so.</p><p>Many believe that such activities do not lead to direct violence against women, but that is not borne out by the facts. In a UK survey of 240 prostitutes in Leeds, Glasgow and Edinburgh, 50 per cent of those who work outdoors and 26 per cent of those who work indoors reported some form of violence by clients in the six months preceding the survey. It might not be good to say this, but it is the truth. Among prostitutes who work outdoors, 81 per cent had experienced violence by clients. Of those women, 33 had been beaten, 30 per cent had been threatened with a weapon, 25 per cent had been choked, 27 per cent had been raped in a form or manner that I do not want to mention in the chamber, and 9 per cent had been slashed or stabbed. It is horrifying to think of that.<place-holder colnum=\"31931\"/></p><p>Any debate about the roots of violence against women needs to examine those activities and understand how they contribute to the way in which women are viewed and how that relates to violence against women. The national group's definition goes on to state:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"These activities have been shown to be harmful for the individual women involved and have a negative impact on the position of all women through the objectification of women's bodies.\"</p><p>We must remember that.</p><p>I welcome the fact that we are here today to take forward the national strategy to address domestic violence in Scotland and to look at the progress that has been made, but today's debate must also serve as a wake-up call to look more deeply at the reasons behind violence against women and, if necessary, to tackle the issues that we have been reluctant to look at in the past.

I have visited kinship carers and I know that they hold her work in great esteem. I take this opportunity to recognise the invaluable work that kinship carers do in some of the most trying of circumstances. I also recognise the great work of the many support groups that do their utmost to provide advice and assistance to kinship carers. Recently, I visited one such group&#8212;the Family Addiction Support Service, based in Glasgow. I put on record the fact that the service is doing a fantastic job. Some of the stories I heard&#8212;especially, but not only, from grandparents&#8212;at that meeting were absolutely harrowing, but they showed people's great desire to ensure that their families are kept together. We should all be eternally grateful for that.</p><p>The benefits system has been highlighted in my meetings with kinship carers. Other members may raise that issue. We must look at it. I do not want to be political about the matter, but in some instances people are worse off if they can access kinship care. I hope that the Minister for Children and Early Years will speak to his Westminster counterpart about the benefits system.</p><p>The overarching theme of the meeting was the clear need for information and guidance to maximise the effectiveness of current Scottish Parliament legislation. As Johann Lamont said, that theme is reflected in the motion. It is also reflected in petition PE1365, which calls for a meeting of all parties that are involved in the legislation for and provision of kinship care. Johann Lamont has already mentioned what a postcode lottery kinship care can be. All members of the Public Petitions Committee, from all parties, were supportive of the petition. I understand that the committee is continuing the petition, with the aim of facilitating a meeting between stakeholders. I hope that that approach will be successful in addressing carers' concerns and the concerns that are expressed in the motion. I invite the minister in his summing up to provide us with an update on whether meetings not just with kinship carers but with local authorities and other authorities that deal with kinship care have been arranged.</p><p>Some of the accounts that I heard were harrowing. Johann Lamont has already alluded to some of the issues that are involved. For one reason or another, grandparents have had to take in their grandkids. They may get kinship care <place-holder colnum=\"31807\"/> support for one grandkid but not for another. That anomaly should not be allowed to continue. Johann Lamont mentioned the issues that arise in relation to payment. I was struck by the differences in access to services. If a child is looked after&#8212;for example if they are in foster care&#8212;they will have access to facilities such as child psychiatrists; if a child is in kinship care they are not denied access to such facilities, but they are nonetheless unable to access them. That issue, along with anomalies in payments, was highlighted to me in my meeting with kinship carers.</p><p>Neither the postcode lottery that has been identified nor the other difficulties that people face should be allowed to continue. People open their houses to look after not just grandchildren but nieces, nephews, brothers and sisters. They put their family first, but it is difficult for them to cope with young kids who have some horrifying backgrounds. Sometimes, people have to give up their beds or to move out of the house because they do not have not enough room.</p><p>Johann Lamont mentioned the political aspect of the issue. I do not want to go into that as I agree that we really need to work together, no matter what political party we belong to, and to put the interests of carers and children first. They deserve no less from us.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145723", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Support for Children (Kinship Care)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Johann Lamont on securing this evening's debate.

That is the honest truth, which we must get on the record.</p><p>I pay tribute to the many groups and individuals who have worked tirelessly to ensure that we have the knowledge and expertise to deal with asylum seekers and refugees. Without that knowledge and expertise, we would not have been able to point them in the right direction or to help them get the right lawyers. They would have been floundering and so would we.</p><p>Glasgow is a beacon. The work that it has done is held up by other areas of Great Britain as something that other people should emulate and follow.</p><p>I seriously wonder if UKBA decided to send out the letters because the integration of asylum seekers and refugees in Glasgow is so great. They have great community spirit. They are welcomed in Glasgow and people work to help them. I seriously wonder if that is why the letter was sent out.</p><p>We are talking about human beings and human rights. For someone to receive a letter that informs them that they will be forced to move within three days and with no idea where they will be moved to is unacceptable, no matter who the person is. To be told that they cannot take any possessions is barbaric, and I have already talked in a previous debate about people being told to take only two pieces of luggage. It is quite harrowing; it brings up memories of a darker era in European history. It is appalling that a UK Government agency should act in that way, but unfortunately it is not surprising.</p><p>The way in which UKBA has operated under the previous Labour Government and now under the Con-Dem coalition means that it has been out of control for many years. Successive UK <place-holder colnum=\"31716\"/></p><p>Governments have sanctioned the illegal detention of children and dawn raids, used every means to circumvent the law and denied many asylum seekers their basic human rights.</p><p>The way in which the UKBA interacts with elected representatives and local government is equally revealing. It does not want to speak to Glasgow City Council, other groups that I have referred to and elected members. As an elected member, I have dealt with hundreds of asylum seekers. I challenge the Westminster Government and the UKBA to say what I should do if someone comes to my office who desperately wants help, and I have to say to them that I cannot help them. They are constituents who have arrived in the country and are staying in Glasgow, so they are entitled to the representation that we can afford to give them.</p><p>We have built up expertise: why should we lose it? We have built up so much expertise that I, and other elected representatives, can pick up a phone and get people housing and some kind of money and put them in touch with groups or expert lawyers who can help them. It has taken years to build up that knowledge and, all of a sudden, we are now being told that we cannot act. I used to be able to phone the immigration office in London and get direct contact, but in the past few years, we have needed a PIN number.</p><p>I have to ask what the Westminster MPs are doing. Why are they not saying that we should be treated as equally are they are? It is as if they are protecting something and they do not do any work on it.</p><p>If an asylum seeker, refugee or whoever comes to me for advice or help, I for one am going to give them it, regardless of what Westminster says.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21145429", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Kingdom Border Agency"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Anne McLaughlin on securing an extremely important debate.

I join with other members in thanking the committee clerks for all their hard work in preparing the report. I thank the convener and admire her tenacity in pushing the subject and securing this welcome chamber debate.</p><p>Irene Oldfather mentioned in her opening speech that the committee&#8217;s recommendations look to the Government taking a much more proactive approach&#8212;having an early-warning system, if you like&#8212;to identify legislation that has a direct effect on the Scottish Parliament. It is important to get that right. </p><p>I turn to some comments that were made in the debate. In her first speech, Fiona Hyslop raised the issue of subsidiarity, as did Ian McKee, albeit that his comments were in a different vein. Subsidiarity is important. Like other committee members, I believe that it allows the Scottish Parliament greater opportunities to become involved. That is why we must have in place a system to ensure that we monitor the memoranda that come forward and other European areas that affect Scotland. I also welcome the recognition of the need for closer working with Westminster and the revised explanatory memoranda management system. The minister also referred to that in her first speech. Pauline McNeill spoke about what the EU means to the public. I agree with her on the light bulb issue. I also know where to buy old-style light bulbs. I can give her the name of the shop where I have just bought about 40 old-style light bulbs. I wanted to do that before they were taken off the shelves. Pauline McNeill made an important point when she said that we may talk about light bulbs and other such issues, but the key point is what the general public takes out of Europe and what the Parliament can get across to them. As parliamentarians, we must ensure that the public <place-holder colnum=\"31489\"/> knows exactly what is happening in Europe and how Europe affects them. That important point may have been missed by some.</p><p>Pauline McNeill also mentioned freedom, security and justice, as did Helen Eadie. They were absolutely right to mention the uniqueness of the Scots law system and why it must be protected. We have to be very vigilant on the issue.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank outlined many areas of the treaty. Like other members, he reiterated the need for vigilance, in particular on the CFP, in which he has a special interest. That is probably why he has been on the European and External Relations Committee for so long. He is absolutely right to say that we have to keep an eye on that one.</p><p>Iain Smith was right to remind us that the treaty is about reforming the institution of Europe. That point was well made, because it is sometimes missed.</p><p>As ever, Chris Harvie brought new insights to the debate. In particular, he highlighted the significance of energy to the European Union and the importance and uniqueness of Scotland&#8217;s position and development in the area. We must monitor and pay close attention to that issue.</p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is about the Lisbon treaty, but Frank McAveety mentioned Lisbon in another context. He made an important point about the influence that the Scottish Parliament should have in Europe. That issue had not been mentioned before, although it has been thought about. He referred to our relationship with MEPs, which is an important point and is discussed in the committee&#8217;s report. The committee was right to raise the issue. Neatly, the member finished on the subject of sport, as he had begun.</p><p>Bill Kidd reminded us that the Lisbon treaty has had a rocky road. I am pleased that Pauline McNeill and others recognised the late Professor Neil MacCormick as a great proponent of Europe and a very good statesman.</p><p>Having participated in an earlier debate with Jackson Carlaw, I can say only that his summing up was as entertaining as ever; I will leave it at that.</p><p>Iain Smith and Pauline McNeill made positive contributions when summing up and reiterated the need for co-operation. That is what it is all about. It is important to stress that, if we co-operate, we can get things right. Sometimes when we talk about Europe, people do not quite understand what we are talking about. It is our duty to ensure that they do. I have been a member of the European and External Relations Committee for between 10 months and a year, but I must admit that I am still getting my head around <place-holder colnum=\"31490\"/> some of the acronyms that it uses. We are Europeans, so we should behave like Europeans and engage with the European Community.</p><p>It is a good move for the Scottish Parliament that recognises that Europe plays a huge part not just in the lives of Scots but in the Scottish Parliament.

Jackson Carlaw basically said that, if we want to blow up millions of people and spend billions of pounds, we must remain a member of the UK, so I am glad that I am a member of the SNP. I look forward to a nuclear-free independent Scotland. I have never been called an anarchist before. Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s speech was the best recruitment message for the SNP and I hope that he will make more such speeches.

Some people might look on the zones as a grass-roots initiative and might be a little sceptical&#8212;Jackson Carlaw is obviously more than that. I will put the situation in perspective. We have heard that nuclear weapons-free zones have been established throughout the world. Wales, which has been mentioned, was declared a nuclear weapons-free zone in 1982, after all 22 of its local authorities announced their support for the measure. We should pursue the initiative. I suggest that we write to ask all our local authorities about it, and publish their answers, with the aim of registering Scotland as a nuclear weapons-free zone.</p><p>In the USA, some native American nations&#8212;they are not states&#8212;such as the Shoshone have declared their land to be a nuclear weapons-free zone because they objected to it being used for missile bases or radioactive waste dumps. That is the grass roots for us. Cities such as New York, Chicago, Oakland and Berkeley have joined the <place-holder colnum=\"31437\"/> growing movement. More than 17 million Americans live in nuclear-free zones. That is people power again.</p><p>The continent of Antarctica is a de facto nuclear weapons-free zone under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. The earth&#8217;s orbit and the moon and all other celestial bodies are also de facto nuclear weapons-free zones under the 1967 outer space treaty. The list goes on&#8212;more than 4,300 nuclear-free zones exist in 37 countries. Let us be clear that, although the initiative might have started at the grass roots, it is a global movement that is gathering momentum hour by hour and day by day. It is time that we aspired to join it.</p><p>One inspirational aspect of many of the movements is that they have gone from the bottom up, as I have said, rather than from the top down. That process has been achieved by people working on the ground with grass-roots movements and listening to what people want. People want nuclear-free zones and no nuclear weapons in their countries.</p><p>We as representatives of the people should listen to that growing voice and do everything that we can to support the initiative. We as parliamentarians should do everything that is in our power to help Scotland to join the growing movement, to add our voice to the global desire and to declare our country nuclear weapons free, in the hope that we will one day live in a nuclear-free world.</p><p>I was going to say that we all share the aspiration, but we have heard otherwise from other members and, unfortunately, no Lib Dems are present.

As one of the original signatories to the bill proposal, I am pleased to speak in this debate and to support the bill at <place-holder colnum=\"31307\"/> stage 1. Like other members, I have no doubt that some&#8212;not all&#8212;factors do not give a good service. We have heard from many organisations on the issue. David McLetchie mentioned the Office of Fair Trading, which carried out a study of factoring that revealed that a substantial number of people were not satisfied with the service that they received.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson gave the example of a case that she has encountered. All of us deal with a huge number of cases that relate to factoring. As someone who stays in a factored property, I know at first hand just how difficult it is to get any service from factors, although I will not name any of the factors that were involved.</p><p>I will give some examples of issues that I have encountered. Duncan McNeil mentioned cases of light bulbs costing &#163;30, but I will highlight one issue that is raised with me and, I think, all other members. People get really frustrated, upset and angry when they receive a bill that is not detailed; when they phone the factors to ask for details, they are told that they must pay the bill as it stands, although they do not know what they are paying for. There is a particular problem with factors using preferred contractors. Even when tenants and residents look for contractors that can do the job more cheaply, factors will not accept a quote from them; basically, they go for the highest price. In some cases&#8212;not all&#8212;a percentage of the costs goes to the factor and not to the contractor.</p><p>Another issue is competitive tendering. When people ask their factor whether it has sought tenders from three contractors, they are told that it has not, because it has its preferred contractor. However, when people look around, they may find that the contractor that they wanted could do the work for half the price that their factor's contractor is offering. Issues of that kind really frustrate and annoy the people who are required constantly to pay such bills.</p><p>As has been said, people may be sent letters with a charge of &#163;30 or &#163;35 to say that they are two days behind in paying their factor's fees. There is absolutely no understanding of how people have to live and of how angry they get when they are trying to get repairs done. When people have bought flats in properties that include residences that have been let privately, it is very difficult for them to get the factor to contact the landlord, to ensure that they pay their share of any bills.</p><p>Although I am very supportive of the bill, there are some issues that I want to raise. Patricia Ferguson will understand that my points are not intended as a criticism of the bill. However, like other members, in the limited time that I have I would like to explore some issues further.<place-holder colnum=\"31308\"/></p><p>The most important section in the bill is that which provides for a code of conduct. I am pleased that the minister and Patricia Ferguson have agreed that we must get that right and that a lot of work has been done on the issue. I look forward to seeing that, because if we get the code of conduct right we can move forward in the proper manner.</p><p>I have some concerns about the registration charge of &#163;750 to &#163;1,000 per factor. In the bill as drafted, it is not clear how that will apply. Will houses be banded by council tax or will the charge apply to groups of properties? Clearly, it will affect private factors, but will it also affect social factors, which have been mentioned and include councils and housing associations? Will there be checks and balances to ensure that the charges that factors pay to register are not passed on to tenants? I would like us to look at that issue at stage 2, as the current provisions in the bill on registration do not address it.</p><p>The issue of dispute resolution has been raised. The bill will establish a home owner housing panel and home owner housing committees similar to the private rented housing panel and private rented housing committees. I do not know how much that will cost, as it is not costed in the financial memorandum to the bill. I would like more information on that provision to be provided at stage 2. The fact that staff will receive specific training is mentioned, but does that mean that more staff will be employed? Will the president, chairmen and committee members come from the existing panel, or will they be appointed or elected? We need to be clear about that.</p><p>A question was raised by the Property Managers Association Scotland regarding complaints procedures relating to property managers. Will the procedures be deemed obsolete if the bill goes through?</p><p>There are further issues that I would like to raise; I hope that we can get them ironed out at stage 2 through amendments. By raising these issues I am not being critical&#8212;I am trying to be constructive&#8212;and I genuinely look forward to stage 2, when we can ensure that we get the bill right for the good of all the people who, like me, live in factored property.</p>", "hdate": "2010-12-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21129301", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Property Factors (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Patricia Ferguson and thank her for introducing the bill.

Some 174 of them are run by local authorities, 637 are private and 132 are run by the voluntary sector.</p><p>Issues relating to care homes, their standards and costs have been raised with me as convener of the cross-party group on older people, age and ageing on numerous occasions. I attended the care conference that the minister mentioned with Mary Scanlon and Richard Simpson. Many issues pertaining to the care of older people were raised at it, and it was very good. I think that 450 providers attended it and they were very aware of the changing demographics, the need to consider different care models and the need to work in <place-holder colnum=\"30562\"/> partnership with all providers, such as local authorities and health boards. I was impressed by the range of ideas that came forward. Some, such as on telecare, which Mary Scanlon mentioned, were innovative, and some were based on plain common sense. People knew exactly what they were talking about and wanted to provide good care for older people.</p><p>The issue of the disparity of costs rumbled about the hall while we sat in it. I am sure that Richard Simpson and Mary Scanlon will remember that the issue came alive during the question-and-answer session. At the time, I said that it was the elephant in the room that people did not particularly want to address. Mary Scanlon's motion concentrates on the issue, and she spoke about it in her speech. I want to pick up on it.</p><p>We were asked questions at the conference and I offered to consider the comparisons between local authority and private provider costs. I have looked at some of the figures, and will refer to them. There is not so much disparity in the average gross weekly charges in care homes for older people figures as some people might think. The Aberdeen City Council charge has been &#163;440 on average per week, whereas the independent figure in the area was &#163;477. The Glasgow City Council charge has been &#163;453 on average per week, whereas the independent figure in the area was &#163;448. The City of Edinburgh Council charge has been &#163;523, whereas the private provider figure in the area was &#163;567. I have more figures and could go on, but I simply want to give members a taster. Things are not as clear-cut as they seem to be. We need to consider the figures. When I said that I would consider the comparisons, I was told that the Local Government and Communities Committee had taken evidence on the subject. Therefore, there is evidence. I hope that we can look at that evidence and that it can provide a basis for seeking further evidence.</p><p>It has been said that there is a lot more to the matter than simply providing care homes for older people. Homes can be used for things such as respite. As our population gets older and in need of care, it is our duty to provide it. I emphasise that we must work together to do that. Health boards, local authorities and others need to work in partnership. I am sorry that things have broken down in Glasgow City Council, but I hope that we can get back to working together. People cannot be admitted to hospital simply because there is no suitable accommodation for them with their family, in the community or in a care home. That is an example; I will not give a name. Admitting such people to hospital is not good for the person or the family, and it is certainly not good for the health service. Older people cannot be left to languish in a hospital because a local authority has quotas, as <place-holder colnum=\"30563\"/> Glasgow City Council has, and they cannot get into a care home or even a house. I know that Jackie Baillie had such a situation in her area. We cannot have such situations, which is why we must ensure that we work together. Doing so is good for the older person, the community and, obviously, the health board. It is obvious that, if someone is languishing in a hospital, they could pick up an infectious disease; indeed, things could be worse for them.</p><p>I think that Jackie Baillie mentioned that this is not just about care homes; it is about other things that they can do. We must consider different models. Care homes can be used for respite and other things.</p><p>The debate has been consensual and very good. We have explored various avenues. If we explore such avenues and get together with providers, we can look for better care for older people and better care in care homes in future.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21091606", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Care Home Costs"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As Mary Scanlon said in her opening speech, there are 943 care homes for older people in Scotland.

That is the premise on which we have to start not just this welcome debate but any strategy that is pursued.</p><p>The debate is not just about getting people back into work and the associated economic benefits of that; it is about improving their quality of life. Working results in improved self-esteem and a feeling of usefulness. Work and being part of a working community can result in physical benefits as part of an active life. The general improvements in physical and mental wellbeing are plain for everyone to see, but there are often worries that some people will be worse off financially. That comes across in every part of the workforce. People who return to work sometimes worry about loss of benefits and so on, but I looked at studies that North Lanarkshire Council carried out, which showed that, on average, people are &#163;124 better off as a result of returning to work. We should consider that premise, too. As well as wanting to be treated equally, people are better off physically and in their pockets if they are working.</p><p>It is clear for all of us to see that supported employment provides both an improved quality of life and clear financial benefits.

Her party was in power for eight years, and she can ask her former ministers, too. I will leave it at that.</p><p>I spoke earlier about how we can encourage growth in supported employment. I few ideas have come to my mind, which I believe should be given serious consideration. Lewis Macdonald spoke about creating a people's champion, and I think that someone else picked up on that idea. That might be a good idea, and it certainly should not be ruled out, but there are barriers to it, as several members have mentioned, which we should be aware of.</p><p>Like Bill Kidd, I might be flying a kite that is not going anywhere, but I have various ideas that I think we could bring into the process. First, in creating employment, supported workplaces take people off benefit and increase tax revenue. Would it not be worth considering lowering national insurance contributions for such enterprises so as to increase their profitability and allow them to expand with greater ease, given that that extra public revenue is already being accrued through increased personal taxation and a reduced extension of benefits? That is one idea.</p><p>Secondly, could we not consider providing VAT relief for such companies to improve their competitiveness? Could we award certain tax breaks for companies that enter into partnership with supported-employment enterprises? That might even be within the competence of the Scottish Government.</p><p>It is important to put forward such ideas, and I do not think that Bill Kidd and I are just flying kites. <place-holder colnum=\"29420\"/></p><p>We are presenting our ideas, and they should be listened to.</p><p>As regards the future of supported-employment workplaces, we are working within certain rules that tie our hands behind our backs, but we should consider every possibility that might help to achieve the desired aim of everyone in the chamber, regardless of their political party.</p><p>Bill Kidd and Frank McAveety mentioned Blindcraft. Have representatives of the City of Edinburgh Council spoken to their counterparts in Glasgow City Council? They should perhaps do that. Blindcraft Glasgow seems to be very successful&#8212;it is making a profit just now and it is working well. Perhaps that could be reciprocated in Edinburgh.</p><p>We must remove the barriers that are faced by people who go into supported employment.

Each and every one of us, regardless of our political parties or thoughts, should think about that. A lot has been done in Glasgow not just in recent years but even under the previous Government, and we still have the reputation for being the most unhealthy city and people in Scotland.</p><p>We are trying to change that, and along with the <em>Evening Times</em> and the Glas-goals campaign I hope that everyone will join in. I have certainly tried to join in. Last Sunday, I joined in the family race around Glasgow Green. It was a good day not just because I had my granddaughter and others with me on bikes, but because everyone enjoyed themselves. It was very much a community and social event&#8212;I think that it was sponsored by milk companies, too. Bill Butler mentioned the tea dance, which lots of people took part in, particularly from areas such as Partick. It was a great success, too.</p><p>The key to the success of such campaigns is that they do not push people to run miles or become really fit in a couple of weeks; they make things enjoyable. Last Sunday, the Singing Kettle put on a show on a stage, and all the young kids thoroughly enjoyed it. Things like that bring people out to enjoy not just the keep-fit part of events but the atmosphere. That is something that we have to consider.</p><p>I do not want to be controversial on this point, but I ask Bill Butler and others to speak to Gordon Matheson of Glasgow City Council to ask him not to stop the free fruit for children in schools in Glasgow. We have just had a debate on fruit and other Scottish produce, so it is fitting that we now have a debate on keeping fit. However, I plead with everyone, particularly Labour colleagues, to tell Gordon Matheson not to stop the free fruit. It would be the most vulnerable people and the ones who need it most who would be affected by that aspect of Gordon Matheson's policies in Glasgow City Council.</p><p>I was going to ask Bill Butler how many miles he has managed to run. I know that he told us how many steps he has taken, so perhaps Patricia Ferguson or somebody else will be able to say how many miles that is. The challenge is to do a lot of miles. I think he said 96 miles, so it is a lot&#8212;I would not like to do it in one day.</p><p>I have tried to do my best through the healthy living centres, and Bill Butler mentioned the fact that we have healthy living centres and health walks. A lot of voluntary groups organise health <place-holder colnum=\"28730\"/> walks&#8212;I know that some do an hour's walk every week in the Maryhill and Woodside areas around the sights in their areas. Indeed, the Annexe healthy living centre in Partick organises walks that go into the communities in Anderston, Partick and Townhead. The last walk I did with that group took us up to the necropolis, which was wonderful; lots of people in Glasgow have not seen the necropolis. There were people from all walks of life.</p><p>We have to ensure that people in Glasgow are fit and healthy, but we cannot force people to take part, so the Glas-goals campaign, because it is different and people will join in, must be welcomed. As Bill Butler said, perhaps other areas will take it on board and use it as a blueprint to get their citizens fit, too.</p><p>I thank Bill Butler once again for securing the debate, and I look forward to the day when Glasgow is not at the bottom of the league in health.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997506", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glas-goals"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Bill Butler and I congratulate him on securing the debate, and I thank the Evening Times for working   in partnership with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the GHA and Glasgow City Council to improve the health of every Glaswegian.

The situation has changed a lot since then, but we must still ensure that supermarkets use local produce and that farmers and everyone else get a fair price for it.</p><p>I will digress slightly from the subject of Scottish produce. At Christmas, I was in one of the big supermarkets when a gentleman came in with a list that his wife or his partner had given him. He was looking for a turnip and he said, \"I can't find turnip anywhere.\" I pointed and said, \"They're there,\" but because they were labelled \"swede\" the man did not have a clue what to buy.

I stay in a built-up area in Glasgow, and people there cannot get access to an allotment, but there are great projects going on just now. The Annexe Healthy Living Centre in Partick is looking at community gardens in the Anderston and Argyle Street areas. I congratulate the centre on its work. If people cannot get access to fresh produce and exercise, we need to be a wee bit more innovative, particularly for those who live in built-up areas.</p><p>I congratulate all those who are involved in grow-your-own-food projects and who are pushing for more allotments.

It is about the serious issue of ensuring that local people can control what takes place in their communities. It is about ensuring that local authorities have at their disposal the tools to do what their communities ask them to.</p><p>My amendment would enable local authorities to license venues that offer sexual entertainment&#8212;in other words, lap-dancing clubs. It would be an optional scheme. It would be for a local authority to decide whether it was appropriate to apply it in its area. It would not be mandatory. It would always be a local authority's choice to apply the legislation if it so wished.</p><p>The amendment would enable a local authority to control the introduction or expansion of lap-dancing premises. It would allow the authority to specify the number of such venues that it considered appropriate for the relevant locality. That number could be zero. Local authorities would also be able to apply operating conditions to, monitor and take action against premises if they did not operate as required.<place-holder time=\"15:15:00\"/></p><p>The new amendment has been significantly redrafted to offer protection to the arts. It specifically excludes licences for hosting theatrical productions and entertainment. The definition of sexual entertainment is explicit and there is provision to extend the exclusions, should that prove necessary. I note the submissions by Scottish Ballet, the Federation of Scottish Theatre, the Festival Fringe Society and others, but I believe that the redrafting covers the concerns that they raise.</p><p>This is intended to be a dual licensing regime, separate from and additional to alcohol licensing. Some premises may require both a licence for alcohol and a licence for sexual entertainment, but I am sure that no member would disagree that this activity deserves more scrutiny and control. I also note the submissions by the Law Society of <place-holder colnum=\"27949\"/> Scotland and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, and COSLA's comments that very few premises fall into this category. I believe that that answers any questions raised by the organisations that I mentioned previously.</p><p>By licensing sexual entertainment venues separately, we also ensure that the fact that a premises does or does not have a premises licence under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 is no longer material to whether it requires a sexual entertainment licence.</p><p>I will address one of the issues that Robert Brown, I think, raised at stage 2. Where there are existing lap-dancing clubs and local authorities wish to impose a zero limit, it would be for the local authority to justify why that approach was appropriate and in the public interest. It would also be for the local authority to demonstrate that the interference with property rights could be justified in the public interest. I think that that answers the concerns that the committee raised.

They voted Labour, and they got a Tory Government, so the Labour Party has some explaining to do.</p><p>I congratulate Ross Finnie on his contribution, which was moving and sincere. As convener of the cross-party group on older people, I, like others, was delighted when the legislation on free personal and nursing care was passed. The cross-party group was very involved in the legislation as it went through the various stages, and I saw it as democracy in action on the part of Lord Sutherland and others.</p><p>Without free personal care, particularly at home, an increasing number of elderly people would be forced to move into care homes. Not only does that deprive them of their home comforts, but the cost of care homes is greater than that of home care. It is estimated that home care costs &#163;5,754 per person per year, whereas care homes cost around &#163;23,000 per person per year. Despite what some members may say&#8212;and have said&#8212;free personal and nursing care, particularly at home, saves money in the long term by reducing the cost to the NHS and to the whole country.</p><p>I will expand on the issue, and give an example of what I am trying to get at. Without free personal and nursing care, older people may put off receiving treatment, which increases their chance of having accidents or of health conditions worsening. That would only add to the &#163;1.4 billion price tag for unplanned emergency hospital admissions, 31 per cent of which&#8212;the largest percentage&#8212;is already spent on older people's care. In the long term, free personal nursing care <place-holder colnum=\"27693\"/> saves Scotland and its NHS money, and I certainly do not believe people's claims that caring for older people is too costly. Yes, we have to be realistic but, as Ross Finnie so eloquently put it in his speech, what kind of society are we if we cannot look after our older people?</p><p>As members have acknowledged, there have been problems with the delivery of free personal and nursing care, not least because of how some&#8212;though, I point out, not all&#8212;local authorities have interpreted the provision of services, in particular food preparation. I welcome the Scottish Government's move to introduce secondary legislation to clarify that issue because, as other members have made clear, free personal and nursing care cannot be subject to a postcode lottery. Clarity is also needed on entitlement, and a common framework must be implemented to ensure that people throughout the country are not affected by yet another postcode lottery. Local authorities must get together on all those issues and move towards implementing a system in which everyone in the country, no matter where they live, receives the same free personal care.</p><p>The withdrawal of the attendance allowance from Scottish pensioners, which Christine Grahame went into in great detail, is scandalous and, indeed, discriminatory. My mother and father, others' mothers and fathers, relatives and so on worked and paid their taxes all their lives, but these pensioners are now being told that because they have benefited from the Scottish Parliament's progressiveness&#8212;and we all agree that free personal and nursing care has proved to be a fantastic way forward and that it is wonderful that people can now stay in their own homes, be more comfortable, be nearer their relatives and so on&#8212;they will not be able to access that money. People can call that whatever they like, but I believe that it is discriminatory and that those older people are being penalised just because they are Scottish pensioners. If it had happened in any other country in the world, the Government would be taken to court, and I sincerely hope that the issue will be raised in the new partnership&#8212;I think that that is what we are calling it; it is not yet a concordat&#8212;between the Scottish Government and the new Government in Westminster. The issue desperately needs to be clarified. The money has been taken away from Scottish pensioners just because they are Scottish and because the Scottish Government is progressive in its approach to health, and we need to get it back.</p><p>A tenth of our older people rely on free personal and nursing care.

It was built more than a century ago in the 1800s and its last major modernisation took place more than 30 years ago in the 1970s, as Pauline McNeill said. The subway is at risk of becoming seriously outdated if the problem is not addressed.</p><p>The subway has a major need for improvements, such as better access for disabled passengers. As members know, the subway does not have sufficient disabled lifts, which discourages many people from Glasgow and outside Glasgow from using public transport.</p><p>Improvements are needed across the board to deliver the Glasgow subway system into the <place-holder colnum=\"27539\"/> future. As members will agree, extending the subway's opening hours would greatly benefit the city. Closing the subway at 6 o'clock on a Sunday and at 11 pm during the week in a city such as Glasgow is unacceptable. Providing further public transport after 11.30 pm throughout the week and at weekends would be desirable and would serve as a safe option for members of the public who were returning home from socialising in the city centre.</p><p>Redevelopment is needed at stations such as St Georges Cross, whose platform extends for barely 4m. More frequent trains are needed in peak and off-peak times. As members will know, waiting times change drastically throughout the day from four minutes to more than 10 minutes. One day, I waited for 15 minutes at Partick for the next subway service, without notification of the delay at the station. The implementation of a smart card would boost the use of all public transport in the Glasgow area and would be most welcome.</p><p>All those measures can be implemented only if SPT is reformed from its foundations. That means no more lavish expenses for councillors' luxury trips and travel at a time when subway services are becoming worse. That situation has angered the people of Glasgow.</p><p>Reviving and improving the subway could bring benefits to Glasgow and improve inner-city transport, but SPT must be trusted to do the job. Openness and accountability must be SPT's top priority. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has a president and vice-presidents from different political parties and different local authorities. SPT must adopt such a stance if progress is to be made. It is not in the interests of democracy or the travelling public that only Labour councillors hold senior positions in SPT. SPT must be aware of that. I recognise that Pauline McNeill said that we must all work together, but SPT and Labour councillors must work with other authorities and other political parties to deliver a decent subway for all the people of Glasgow.</p><p>As I said, reform of SPT remains essential. At First Minister's question time on 25 February, the First Minister said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we will press SPT to reform itself ... if that reform does not materialise, we will consider amending the existing order that defines its constitution\".&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2010-02-25.24033.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 25 February 2010; c 24033.]</citation></p><p>Reform is needed in SPT and evidence of change is needed, instead of the mass spending that I mentioned on overseas restaurants and trips to European final football matches.

It is shameful that there are no media representatives in the press gallery. I had hoped that the debate would open the media's eyes to the fact that the EU is an extremely important part of the governance of not only Scotland but the UK and Europe. I had hoped that media reports on the debate would have gone some way towards giving people out there an understanding of what Europe is all about and how important it is to Scotland, the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government.</p><p>As Irene Oldfather pointed out, it is important that the Scottish Government engages with the European Parliament at all levels. It should engage with rapporteurs, commissioners and MEPs&#8212;and basically anyone else in Europe, particularly the Scottish Parliament's European officer. It is important to get in early and find out exactly what is coming out of Europe, and in her evidence to the committee, the minister has confirmed that that is basically what we do. It is important for us to keep an eye on what is happening in Europe. If the press is not going to tell everyone what is happening, it is up to individual MSPs and the Parliament to let folk know what is going on in Europe.</p><p>Does the minister have it in mind to hold a meeting with representatives of the new coalition Government at Westminster to discuss the importance of Europe for the Scottish Government and the Scottish people? Perhaps she can answer that in a letter.</p><p>I will concentrate on a couple of areas in the short time that I have left: combating poverty, and renewable energy and the energy grid. Reducing poverty is one of the EU 2020 targets, which I very much welcome. However, the European and External Relations Committee and the Scottish Government need to monitor closely what comes out of those targets. We need to do that not to ensure that poverty is eradicated&#8212;although I hope <place-holder colnum=\"26051\"/> that it will be eradicated throughout the European Union eventually&#8212;but to ensure that the developing European member states get as much from the targets as others member states do. We sometimes overlook the developing member states that have come in, which contribute a lot to the European budget although they do not always get a lot out of it. Many members of the public do not seem to realise that. I want to keep a special eye on the target of combating poverty, to ensure that people who are in real, severe poverty actually benefit from that target.</p><p>On renewable energy and the energy grid, everyone knows that Scotland has a significant proportion of Europe's renewable energy in the form of wind and tidal power. Scotland is at the forefront of pushing through the energy agenda, and it can lead the rest of Europe, as has been said not just by me and other members but by eminent professors in Europe. Scotland had already reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 19.2 per cent in 2007; in 2008, the emissions reduction percentage across the whole of the UK was just over 19 per cent. Scotland carries the rest of Britain when it comes to climate change and renewable energy. We need to remind ourselves that we are world leaders, and European leaders in particular. The Scottish Government must work with the new Westminster Government&#8212;as it had to work with the previous one&#8212;on the subject of renewable energy and the energy grid.</p><p>I am concerned about transmission charges for the energy grid. Under current transmission charging systems, the remote areas of northern Scotland pay as much as &#163;42.13 per kilowatt, whereas people in the south-west of England pay &#163;6.98 per kilowatt. That is a direct disadvantage. I hope that we can get together with the new Westminster Government and the European Commission to iron that out.</p><p>I would have liked to speak about the national grid, but my time is running out and I need to finish. We need to consider poverty, transmission charges and the energy grid. Scotland is a world leader on renewable energy, and we do not want to be penalised because of high transmission charges.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20766154", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Commission (Work Programme)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to speak in the debate, not only to raise the profiles of the European and External Relations Committee and the European Commission but to highlight the workings of the EU, which not that many people outwith the Parliament know about.

The SCDEA has seized &#163;43.5 million-worth of class A drugs and the community cashback initiative has invested &#163;13 million of seized money in our communities.

I met him on Monday at the crime summit, along with Patricia Ferguson, Bob Doris and the cabinet secretary. I echo the praise that we have heard for Mr Pearson, who this week said that councils and public authorities face a growing threat of corruption and bribery. We must remember that the public sector has massive spending power, <place-holder colnum=\"24574\"/> amounting to &#163;8 billion over the whole sector. Various members, including Bill Aitken, have mentioned procurement contracts, which we need to look at carefully, especially those regarding the security industry. When I was a councillor in Paisley&#8212;Hugh Henry will remember this, as he was the leader of the council at that time&#8212;Renfrewshire Council had a terrible time with a security firm that was run by the Gillespies, called Ferguslie Park Community Business Security. It is not as though such problems have just arisen; they have been happening for a long time, but it is difficult to pin the firms down and sort them out. The Gillespies' firm was eventually sorted out.</p><p>I will move on to the contracts that security firms have with other councils&#8212;including Glasgow City Council, because I am a Glasgow MSP. It is frightening to hear what has been happening in the security industry in Glasgow. We have all read about it in the newspapers and seen it on television; some of those security firms have been allowed to run amok. We put in extra checks and balances with regard to procurement for the Commonwealth games, but it was unfortunately too late for some of the firms to take part.</p><p>One security firm took great umbrage at not being able to get the security contract for the games, and&#8212;although the firm denies this, so I use the word \"allegedly\"&#8212;one of the areas was fire bombed. The firm denied all involvement, but it still holds the contract for the velodrome for the Commonwealth games, which I find very worrying.</p><p>I hear perfectly well the views of the cabinet secretary and the crime summit on procurement. There is EU law on that, in which Lord Mandelson has a say, and I thank Cathie Craigie for her commitment to join us in writing to Lord Mandelson to try to rectify the situation.

They would have been in the public gallery, but I believe that they are meeting the Presiding Officer.</p><p>In this debate, we will celebrate Commonwealth day 2010 and the invaluable work that Commonwealth associations throughout the world undertake in fostering better relations and understanding between our nations.</p><p>As we all know, last year, the Commonwealth celebrated its 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Karen Gillon led the debate that we had on that occasion and stressed the enduring importance and relevance of the Commonwealth 60 years after its inception. This year, the world faces new challenges and opportunities, and it is therefore entirely fitting that, as we move forward into the next 60 years, we focus on the huge potential for positive change that science and technology can bring to the Commonwealth nations.</p><p>As we know, the success of the Commonwealth is also marked by its huge diversity. It includes some of the world's richest nations and some of the poorest, which presents us with a unique <place-holder colnum=\"24438\"/> opportunity to share disparate experience and expertise in many areas.</p><p>Those sentiments were echoed in \"An Uncommon Association&#8212;A Wealth of Potential\", the final report on the Commonwealth's conversation, which was published last Monday to coincide with the annual Commonwealth day. I recommend that members get hold of a copy of that document as it makes excellent reading. It is very truthful and to the point.</p><p>It is entirely appropriate that the Commonwealth should focus on the benefits that can be brought about through greater shared use of science and technology. As we go away from today's debate, let us reflect on the fact that one of the major findings of the report was that, although people are inspired by the values and principles of the Commonwealth, they are frustrated that we do not always uphold them. I believe that upholding the moral and ethical considerations that have brought us together and shaped us and which bind us will be the greatest challenge of the 21st century. If the Commonwealth is to take its place as an important international organisation, it must hold to its core values and beliefs, have the courage of its convictions and speak out on behalf of the many nations within it that feel increasingly disfranchised in a world that is increasingly bereft of ethical and moral guidance.</p><p>I hope that many other members share my view that it is time to define and carry forward those moral and ethical considerations for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Although the report recognised that the Commonwealth has all the necessary ingredients to be a leading, effective and influential association in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it pointed to the fact that the Commonwealth family must adapt and make more strategic use of its many assets in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Through a greater recognition of science and technology, more can indeed be done with less, for those two disciplines have been fundamental driving forces throughout the past century in redefining how society operates by making knowledge and innovation tangible to all societies, wherever they may be. That, in turn, has helped society to develop in myriad ways, be it through better health care and a better understanding of how to live sustainably or, indeed, through greater knowledge of an individual's human rights.</p><p>Although we recognise the genius of Scots such as Alexander Graham Bell, John Logie Baird and Alexander Fleming, it is incumbent on the many organisations that are involved in science and technology to work with developing countries to strengthen their expertise in this area. I believe that that is what the Commonwealth is all about and that that is what the many countries that are part of the Commonwealth&#8212;developed and <place-holder colnum=\"24439\"/> developing&#8212;wish.

I do not believe that voluntary regulation will work&#8212;it must be statutory&#8212;but I wanted to mention the view of CFS, which spoke to people. Those are the answers that it got back, and we have to look at everything. CFS makes a valid point, which is why I wanted to raise it.</p><p>Like others, I have spoken to the minister, and I know that whether any system is statutory or voluntary is not set in tablets of stone. We have to take into account everybody's ideas on the proposed bill. As Malcolm Chisholm mentioned, there may be various amendments as the bill goes through Parliament. We have to consider everything. Although there is a cost, we are dealing with people's lives. As Margaret Curran mentioned, we are talking not just about property but about how people live their lives.</p><p>I want to give some examples of good and bad practice. One issue is a lack of information when people move into a tenement property or, as Mary Scanlon rightly said, a new-build property. People do not know how much maintenance will cost and <place-holder colnum=\"24252\"/> what the factoring fees will be. Malcolm Chisholm's example was one of the best&#8212;when the residents shopped around, they were able to save hundreds of pounds on their insurance bill. As I know to my own cost, factors never tell people that they can save that amount of money. That is why it is important to address the lack of information.</p><p>There is also an issue with the difficulty in having repairs carried out. Even more so in some cases, there is difficulty in finding out whether repairs have been carried out. People get a bill and pay it, but then they think, \"I didn't see anyone come out to do the work. Who let them in?\" When they phone the factor, they cannot get any answers or a breakdown of the bill, and yet in some cases they are paying thousands of pounds. There is sometimes no proof that repairs have been carried out&#8212;there is no receipt or breakdown&#8212;but people have to pay for them.</p><p>Of course, when people query the bill and say, \"I'm sorry, but I don't see that the repair work has been done and I'm withholding payment until I see evidence of it,\" the next thing is that they get a letter from a sheriff officer saying that they are being taken to court. That is an important issue&#8212;people are very dissatisfied with how things are dealt with.</p><p>Another issue is that when people query a bill and ask factors to get quotations from other builders, joiners, gardeners or other maintenance people, factors never seem to do it. As Malcolm Chisholm's example showed, people can save hundreds of pounds when they shop around, but when they ask the factor, \"Why didn't you do that?\", they reply, \"Well, it's not my job.\" Factors are not being proactive; they are basically just collectors of money. They are not doing anything for the tenants.</p><p>I am talking about the bad factors, which are mostly in the private sector. I must admit that I used to get most complaints about the GHA, but, as others have said, Martin Armstrong and the minister seem to have improved things there, so I get a lot fewer complaints about the GHA than I did before. I mostly get complaints about private factors.</p><p>Mary Scanlon mentioned other areas, but as a Glasgow MSP I get most of my complaints from tenement properties and the residents meetings that I attend. The complaints are both worrying and annoying for people. Most of the people I represent are working and are not in during the day, so they cannot prove that things have been done&#8212;even changing a light bulb, as was said. We would think that it costs a couple of pounds to buy a light bulb, but people can get a &#163;300 bill for changing one light bulb and cannot even prove that it has been done.<place-holder colnum=\"24253\"/></p><p>We have to regulate those problems. I look forward to the bill going through the parliamentary process. We agree that something needs to be done, but we may want to lodge amendments to toughen or slacken the bill, and there will be an opportunity to do that.</p><p>I congratulate Patricia Ferguson on bringing forward the proposed bill, and I thank the minister for lodging his amendment, which should be acceptable to members. I hope that we can move forward in consensus, because people who live in factored buildings&#8212;myself included, I must admit&#8212;are having to put up with problems day after day, week after week.

I hope that local authorities will be able to look at that suggestion.<place-holder colnum=\"24152\"/></p><p>A good example is Drumchapel, which I visited on Friday to meet what used to be called Drumchapel Opportunities. The area has been deprived for&#8212;gosh&#8212;decades, but it still has derelict land sitting there. That is not just an eyesore but a disgrace. It would be good if something could be done about that. The land was supposed to be for regeneration 10 years ago, but I honestly do not know what has happened, as the \"For Regeneration\" signs have been taken down. To wake up to that every morning, or to see that when going to the shops, certainly does not make people feel good.</p><p>As a Glasgow MSP, I have seen many changes, particularly in the city centre with the regeneration of the harbour site. We should congratulate Steven Purcell&#8212;I know that everyone here will wish him all the best for a speedy recovery&#8212;on working to achieve that along with other agencies. He has done much to redevelop the harbour site, so we should give credit where credit is due. However, local government obviously needs to work in tandem not just with the Government of the day but with many other organisations. Although that has happened in Glasgow's harbour area development, regeneration has not really reached other areas of Glasgow. That is a disappointment. With the Commonwealth games coming to Glasgow, we must ensure that those areas that have not enjoyed regeneration also now benefit. They need not just short-term, quick-fix jobs and housing but long-term benefits for everyone in those communities and for the people at large.</p><p>As the minister mentioned, regeneration needs to be targeted not just by Government but by local authorities, community planning partnerships, community health and care partnerships, the voluntary and private sectors and the local communities. All those groups need to be consulted and involved. However, as Johann Lamont mentioned, a recent report highlighted Glasgow as one of two areas where the CPPs and CHCPs do not engage with the voluntary sector or with local communities. Indeed, I am sure that I am not the only MSP to have been told by voluntary groups that their local knowledge of problems and issues is overlooked by the CHCPs and CPPs. As other members have said, the voluntary organisations feel that those partnerships are not operating as they should. I ask the minister to look into that, because I am sure that those partnerships were set up to operate with, rather than just talk down to, the local groups on the ground. Unfortunately, in Glasgow&#8212;and in another area that I cannot remember&#8212;the partnerships do not operate in that way.</p><p>I also ask the minister to look at the boards of those organisations. As Ross Finnie mentioned, <place-holder colnum=\"24153\"/> many different organisations, such as SIPs, were set up many years ago to try to help deprived areas. However, their boards are often unrepresentative not just of local people but even of the political parties. I ask the minister to look at the boards of the CHCPs and CPPs to see whether they are representative. I hope that something can be done about that to ensure that there is parity for all on those boards.</p><p>For decades now, in Glasgow&#8212;and elsewhere, as Ross Finnie mentioned&#8212;we have had various schemes to try to target deprived areas. Billions of pounds have been spent, but the same areas are still suffering from deprivation. After decades in which money has been thrown at them, those areas have never risen out of deprivation and people are, unfortunately, still suffering and in need. In this day and age when we are looking at fresh thinking, we cannot allow that situation to continue, so I would like some form of monitoring of the money that is invested in those areas. Perhaps if we had had such monitoring 10 or 20 years ago, the areas might not be in the position that they are in today. We could learn from our successes and from our mistakes, but that has never been done despite all the moneys that have been pushed through SIPs and so on. When various colours of Government&#8212;whether Tory, Labour or Labour and Lib Dem&#8212;have been in power, we have never had feedback to tell us exactly how well those schemes are doing. Therefore, my plea to the minister and the Government is for some form of monitoring so that we can see where the successes are, which we can then replicate, and perhaps catch in time&#8212;before the situation goes on for another decade&#8212;those schemes that are not successful.</p><p>It is about time that we targeted the moneys. Not just the Government and the Scottish people generally but the people who live in these communities need to be able to see that they get long-term benefits, such as employability and long-term sustainability.</p>", "hdate": "2010-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20662587", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Karen Gillon is right about that.

I will go on to explain my interest in the matter, but first I congratulate Aileen Campbell on securing the debate and allowing me to go down memory lane.</p><p>I have not moved from Glasgow to Lesmahagow or South Lanarkshire, and I did not receive one of Aileen Campbell's questionnaires. For the benefit of members and those in Lesmahagow who are, I believe, watching on video, I explain that many years ago&#8212;and I do mean many years ago&#8212;I and others from urban areas in Glasgow had the great pleasure of going to Lesmahagow and the Jubilee hall courtesy of our local churches, our Band of Hope and sometimes the Salvation Army. I do not know the village well now, but I certainly knew it well then. When I saw Aileen Campbell's motion, I rummaged through my suitcases for my old pictures of Lesmahagow Jubilee hall, which confirmed my memories of ma, pa and the bairns with their prams, the big tea urns and the huge breadboards of sandwiches and buns.</p><p>I was sad to hear about the plans to close the Jubilee hall; after all, as the motion says and as people have told me, it is an important part of the town's heritage, so I cannot understand why it cannot be saved for future generations, not just of people from Lesmahagow but of people who might visit the town, as I did so many years ago. Indeed, the fight to save the Jubilee hall might well bring in tourists.</p><p>I am not sure why this is a contentious issue&#8212;I have to say that I could not quite understand what Andy Kerr meant in his speech. Of course, I stand to be corrected, but when I tried to find out what was going on in Lesmahagow the people there told me that there had been no consultation on the proposal to close the hall. Where in South Lanarkshire Council's plans is the proposal mentioned? I certainly acknowledge that, as Aileen Campbell, Michael McMahon and Andy Kerr have made clear, this is a council issue&#8212;it is not, I should add, even a Glasgow City Council issue.</p><p>Although South Lanarkshire Council has bought the Fountain hall for &#163;500,000 and has allocated another &#163;1 million for refurbishment, it has itself <place-holder colnum=\"22863\"/> admitted that the building is not suitable for all the events that already take place in the Jubilee hall, and it has suggested to the groups that will be without certain facilities that they can use local schools instead. As Aileen Campbell and the people to whom I have spoken have said, that cannot happen if, for example, examinations are taking place.</p><p>I have to wonder why some of the &#163;1.5 million that is to be spent on the Fountain hall cannot be used to refurbish the Jubilee hall, which has been around for a lot longer but has better changing facilities, a stage and so on. It is one thing to tell people that the Fountain hall will have all those facilities once it is refurbished, but surely if it ain't broke, we do not need to fix it. The council should say to the community, \"Right, we've spent &#163;500,000 on this building, but we're going to have to spend another &#163;1 million on refurbishing it. Would you rather see that &#163;1 million spent on the Jubilee hall?\" I am sure that the Jubilee hall could easily be brought up to modern-day standards with only a fraction of that money, leaving perhaps enough money to turn the Fountain hall into a facility for, say, youth groups.</p><p>Finally, have the people in Lesmahagow thought about submitting a petition to the Public Petitions Committee to allow community representatives to give evidence and bring to light issues surrounding the Jubilee hall, the Fountain hall and whatever else? I do not know the answer to that, but I am sure that Aileen Campbell will tell me after the debate. In any case, I believe that the way forward is for the people in the town to get a petition together, if they have not already done so. I am sure that Aileen Campbell and other members will give them all the advice that they need in that respect.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20498112", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lesmahagow Jubilee Hall"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I wondered whether you were speaking to me when you mentioned that the debate should be specifically about Lesmahagow.

I also remind Mr Stone that these conclusions are not mine; they are the views of the House of Commons library and experts in the field of welfare provision. Johann Lamont is not in the chamber, but I want to put on record that I would be happy to give her a copy of this research so that she can better inform not only herself but the rest of the Labour Party about what is happening.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that these proposals have met with real opposition from Scottish society and <place-holder colnum=\"22830\"/> the various organisations that represent the wide range of people who are likely to be affected. At my surgeries, at meetings of elderly forums and so on, people who have supported Labour all their lives&#8212;in other words, Labour's core vote&#8212;have approached me to express their concerns and worries about these changes. They are angry at the attitude of their Labour representatives and are looking for people who will stand up for them and ask the questions that the Labour Party is so unwilling to ask. The UK Government might have acknowledged the need to explain these reforms and engage with people who have concerns or who might be affected by the changes, but the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament does not seem to think that it should talk to people and find out what they think about what is going on.</p><p>As for the consultation process that has been much lauded by Helen Eadie&#8212;who has also left the chamber&#8212;and other members of the Labour Party, I accept that a public consultation and a series of 36 stakeholder events were organised between last July and October to give stakeholder audiences the opportunity to learn about the green paper, to share responses and to meet and question senior policy officials. However, as I said earlier, all 36 events were held in England; not one took place in Scotland. That is an absolute disgrace.</p><p>Perhaps a member of the Labour Party might in one of their speeches, in summing up or whatever, explain why people in Scotland have been sidelined, ignored and not consulted and are, as usual, expected to bear the brunt of funding social care in England. Even though the UK Government has explicitly stated that the changes will affect the whole of the UK, I fear that we will hear nothing. Also, the Labour Party keeps telling us that the Scottish Government has been consulted, but we now know from the minister that it has not been informed at all. Perhaps when she is summing up, Jackie Baillie will be able to tell me different. I am sure that she will come up with something. It is simply not acceptable to propose the changes without holding one single meeting to discuss their effects with the people who will be directly affected, while it is deemed necessary to hold 36 meetings in England alone.</p><p>I would also be interested to know how those meetings were funded. Were they funded by the Benefits Agency? If they were, that would mean that Scottish taxpayers paid to inform people in England of changes while being denied that information here in Scotland. We should know that.</p><p>While we are talking about those who are directly affected by the changes, we should take a moment to think about those who will be indirectly affected&#8212;those who dedicate their lives to caring <place-holder colnum=\"22831\"/> for others. Thousands of people save the social care services millions of pounds a year, and we should not forget that, at some point in our lives, most people will know or will become a carer. The proposed changes to carers allowance will directly affect the people who put their lives to one side to care for others, because currently their allowance depends on the people they care for receiving attendance allowance. That is one more reason why the proposals are ill-thought-out and potentially very damaging, and why the UK Government must commit to engaging seriously with stakeholders not only in England but in Scotland before attempting to take its proposals any further.</p><p>The Labour Party opposite has been told often enough, so it must know that the proposals have met real opposition throughout Scotland and that, despite assurances from Labour, all is not clear and all is not well.

As many members have pointed out, according to an international study last year, Scotland has gone from 14<sup>th</sup> to 26<sup>th</sup> place and England has fallen from third to 19<sup>th</sup> place. However, in the spirit of clarity and consensus, let us not forget&#8212;it has been mentioned by many members, including Cathy Jamieson&#8212;that the decline happened over many years and under previous Administrations. I hope that we can give credit where it is due: to the Labour Party in opposition for setting up the literacy commission to address those concerns. Labour is to be <place-holder colnum=\"22748\"/> commended for recognising the need to better understand and tackle literacy problems in Scotland. In the same spirit, I hope that we can give credit to the actions of this SNP Government, which, since coming to power has introduced initiatives aimed at improving literacy through support for adult literacy developments and by putting literacy at the heart of the curriculum for excellence, as others mentioned.</p><p>Although the curriculum for excellence might have some detractors among members in the chamber, I hope that today's debate will refocus on the need to work positively and constructively to achieve what is best for the people we serve. I note that the report recommends early intervention, with which I agree. I am sorry that Des McNulty is not in the chamber, but perhaps someone will mention to him when he returns my surprise that in his opening speech he mentioned Glasgow City Council, but did not mention the fact that it removed nursery teachers from schools.

The report sets out much detail about the situation and how to improve it but, if we are to move forward on tackling illiteracy, we must understand why literacy levels are falling in the first place. That is worthy of a full debate, but perhaps it will suffice to receive a commitment from the education secretary today to include in any future deliberations about literacy the reasons why there are problems.</p><p>It is undeniable that we have seen an unprecedented rise in the use of electronic media&#8212;I will go on to say why I think that literacy levels have declined, whether because of television, gaming or other areas&#8212;and I assert that such media have had a direct impact on children's time and volition for reading, as well as on adults' time for reading with them. That is important because, in our debate on how to address the issues, we must not confine ourselves to the remit of academic and professional attainment, which was mentioned before. In our drive to improve literacy, we must be careful that <place-holder colnum=\"22749\"/> we do not unwittingly turn young people off reading so that they see it as a merely academic activity&#8212;something to be tested and quantified. Reading has to be enjoyed and we must be mindful of the fine line between testing and encouraging enjoyment. Those from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to leave school without the necessary skills to realise their potential. Studies have shown that many find themselves in that situation because they find it difficult to accept the testing and qualifications structures that make up a large part of the education system. I hope that that is taken on board by the minister and others.</p><p>It is important for youngsters to enjoy reading and to see it as a fun activity that stimulates their imagination and makes them want to read even more. It is possible to experience the joy of reading and the tingling sensation of suspense that a good book can bring. I am sure that we can all recall a time when it was hard to keep our eyes open and we knew that we should turn off the light, but felt compelled to read the next page or go on to the next chapter. I am sure that we have all enjoyed telling a story to a youngster who got totally absorbed and carried away. Indeed, as one of the members of the literacy commission, Ian Rankin, admitted, he spent much of his childhood reading comics and it was not until he was older that he started reading books. I am glad that he did so.</p><p>It might be difficult to encourage children to go from reading \"Charlie and Lola\" to \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", but we must recapture that encouragement if we want to drive up and sustain literacy levels.

I, too, congratulate the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society on its efforts.</p><p>I also highlight the work of organisations such as NVA and the Glasgow allotments forum, which work constructively with other organisations and the local authority and have been successful in influencing current thinking on the future direction of the provision of allotments. Glasgow City Council recently presented its allotments strategy for 2009 to 2013 to the group. I sincerely hope that the overarching aim of creating an inclusive, vibrant community of allotment gardeners that will contribute to the wellbeing of the citizens of Glasgow will be realised. Of course, for that to happen in Glasgow and throughout Scotland, all stakeholders must work together in a constructive manner to achieve that aim.</p><p>However, the recent experience of people in North Kelvin has not filled many in Glasgow with optimism. The council's attempt to have the local people forcibly removed from the land that they have been using to grow their own food, without proper consultation or discussion of alternatives to the forcible removal of those people, goes directly against its stated aims. Although the council states in its strategy that it is guided by national legislation and public duties, it has acknowledged that, because of the archaic nature of the legislation on allotments, the statutory duty on local authorities to provide allotments is open to interpretation. Given that admission, I would be interested to know the minister's interpretation of the duties on councils. I hope that she will also explain what recourse citizens would have if they believed that a local authority was not fulfilling those duties. If the minister accepts that the current legislation is open to interpretation, will she support a review of the legislation in order to address the uncertainties that exist not just in Glasgow but throughout Scotland?</p><p>Let us not forget that we are trying to empower individuals and local communities to provide for themselves and, as Jim Tolson has said, to teach <place-holder colnum=\"22331\"/> future generations the essential skills of not just gardening but self-determination. Historically, due to many factors that warrant a separate debate, our sense of community and belonging has been eroded to such a point that many people now feel disconnected from the community in which they live. In areas such as those that we have spoken about in Jim Tolson's constituency and in Glasgow, allotments can act as a focal point at which the community can come together and rediscover the values on which we in Scotland pride ourselves. That must also be seen as a fundamental aim of any national policy on the provision of green areas.</p><p>I look forward to receiving the minister's responses to my questions either today or later, in writing, if she does not have the information to hand.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20463840", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Allotments, Community Gardens and Grow-your-own Projects"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jim Tolson on securing this important debate.

I will not quote all the figures that I have&#8212;I know that other members will also have them&#8212;but the most up-to-date ones show that, shockingly, 884 children were detained at Yarl's Wood in England during the period July 2008 to July 2009. As for Scotland, 103 children were detained at Dungavel between October 2008 and September 2009. A total of 1,315 children were detained in three detention centres in the United Kingdom over a 15-month period. That is shameful and immoral in a society&#8212;not just Scotland, but the United Kingdom&#8212;that prides itself on justice, compassion and the protection of children.</p><p>I thank all those individuals and groups who have been working tirelessly, giving of their own time to help and highlight the plight of those children and their families. Without those groups, the needs of the children would not have been properly served, either at Dungavel or in the community.</p><p>I honestly thought that we had made progress in Scotland. In 2005 we called for a protocol to be established regarding the detention of asylum seekers and their families. In 2006 it was hoped that the agreement with the Home Office would begin to address concerns over the detention of families and their children. Although that was a welcome development, it has not removed those <place-holder colnum=\"21773\"/> concerns. The pilot scheme that the Government brought in, which is running in Glasgow, is a start, and I congratulate the Government, but it is not enough. Even to this day, children in Glasgow are being taken to Dungavel, having been removed by the UK Border Agency.</p><p>The UK Government's removal of its reservation concerning the provisions in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child relating to immigration control is long overdue, and I would be interested to hear the minister's views on the legal implications of that reservation for our powers here in Scotland.</p><p>Last year's commitment to limit the detention of children in Scotland to a maximum of 72 hours appeared at the time to be a step forward. Unfortunately, the measure has simply resulted in children being taken from their homes to Dungavel, held for the maximum 72 hours and then transferred to Yarl's Wood in England after that period has expired.</p><p>Just the other day I was speaking about the fact that there were people who had been held in Dungavel for six weeks. Luckily, with the help of the groups that I mentioned, they were set free yesterday. We thought that that maximum period of 72 hours was progress, but it has provided a way to manoeuvre the figures. The lip service that has been paid to the agreement and the way in which the Home Office is getting round the commitment that it made is shameful and totally unacceptable. I urge the minister to take the issue up with the Home Office. As we know, the Home Office is actively directing its staff not to deal with MSPs, and it is encouraging MPs not to intervene, as that can halt the deportation process.</p><p>I and members from other political parties have been working with asylum seekers and refugees for the past 10 years. We have contacts, we know people and we do our utmost to help them. It is scandalous when people who are being detained are denied the basic right of having their case heard. Many families end up being wrongly deported&#8212;that can be life threatening. It seems that the Home Office and the UK Border Agency do not want people to know what is going on, and let us not forget that that is being done in our names.</p><p>What is it that is being done in our names? It fills me with shame and sorrow, but it gives me energy to continue to fight to end what are barbaric practices. It is the children who are the most vulnerable. Many of them fall ill as a result of their detention, and they are left scarred by the experience. Anyone who visits Dungavel, as I and other members have done, will never forget it. People get fingerprinted and photographed as they walk in. We are not allowed to give the kids sweets, and the guards, as I call them, take them <place-holder colnum=\"21774\"/> off us and tell us that they will give them to the kids later. I will never forget the fear on the faces of the kids and their family members. I remember the sadness and hopelessness of it all when we could not even give the kids sweets. A five-month-old baby was admitted to hospital having fallen ill, due to being imprisoned at Dungavel. Babies have lost weight because their mums could not feed them, due to the stress of being in Dungavel. Would we allow that to happen to our children? Would we be outraged? Of course we would. We would be terribly outraged. What would we do about it?</p><p>We have to give those children a voice. They have witnessed terrible, unimaginable horrors&#8212;mutilation, rape, the murder of family members and even whole communities&#8212;but what do we do? We lock them up and for many children those nightmarish images recur. Night after night they relive the events that they experienced, without getting the support that they need and deserve. I can only begin to imagine the dreadful effect that that must have on children and I am ashamed that children are still in detention.</p><p>I will leave members with some quotations from children who have been detained: \"You're locked in when you eat\"; \"It looks like a jail\"; \"There's jagged glass over the bricks\"; \"There's a big door to let cars in and a wee door to let the people in\"; \"There are jaggy bits here and jaggy bits there\"; \"You can't get out to play\"; \"If you want to get out to play, you've got to ask these people, 'Can I get out to play?' You've got to wait till they tell you you can go out\"; \"I'm sad\". On and on and on it goes.</p><p>We should all be not just sad but ashamed that that is happening to young children in Scotland in this day and age. We would not let it happen to our children.

Much has been made of the domestic violence court in Glasgow, which has been successful, and we are aware that the Dumbarton sheriff court will open up a separate courtroom for domestic abuse cases on 21 December, which might address some of the issues that Bill Aitken mentioned. However, despite our debates, the investment and the good work of many people, we still face the problem. We have to ask ourselves why.</p><p>It is clear that too many people believe that it is acceptable for a man to hit a woman on most occasions, on some occasions, or on any occasion. Surveys of public opinion have proved that. Worryingly, a survey showed that even young women think that it is okay for men and boys to hit them in certain circumstances. That is a worrying trend. As are others who have raised the matter, I am keen to ensure that the impact of domestic abuse on children is an integral part of the work that is taken forward. I know that Adam Ingram is working with the Minister for Housing and Communities on that.</p><p>Anne McLaughlin mentioned the no more violence campaign. I had the pleasure of hosting the launch of that campaign last Thursday, which the minister attended. It is funded by the Government, and it involves a group of young people from throughout Scotland who have been elected by their peers. They will have access to ministers, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and officials and they will raise awareness of this heinous crime among their teachers and peers. It is the first campaign of its type in the world. We should pat ourselves on the back for going down that road, because the campaign is an excellent part of our work on the subject.</p><p>Like Margaret Curran, I will not use a lot of statistics because they have already been quoted. We need to look beneath the statistics to discover why violence against women happens. We must continue to work towards stamping out the repugnant idea, which is rooted in some parts of our culture, that it is all right to hit women. Even after 10 years of the Parliament, that is easier said than done, especially as the depiction and treatment of women in some parts of our so-called \"popular\" culture reinforce the very behaviour that we are trying hard to get rid of.<place-holder colnum=\"21755\"/></p><p>I am deeply concerned at the number of young people who are being exposed to brutal images on the internet. Of course, given the nature of the medium, we have very little chance of preventing that, but I note that the issue was covered in last week's stage 1 debate on the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, in which I spoke.</p><p>I am also worried about the portrayal of women in certain music genres and entertainment venues; about the language that is used in lyrics to describe women; and about the sometimes disturbing images in the music videos that accompany these songs. No doubt some people will say that this is only a Mary Whitehouse-type rant from someone who knows nothing about music. Indeed, people have already said as much to me. It is true&#8212;I cannot pretend to be a music expert. However, it is totally unacceptable to justify what is nothing more than the degradation of women by saying that they are only words in a song or images in a video, or by arguing that it is all about artistic freedom. I will probably get lots of e-mails about that, but as far as I am concerned, this has nothing to do with artistic freedom and everything to do with perpetuating the objectification of women by portraying them as second-class citizens. I hate to use these words, but these songs, which are aimed at children and young people and have been deemed acceptable as entertainment, often describe women as bitches and whores. What lessons are such songs teaching the next generation? Will boys be able to grow up to respect women? Will women be able to grow up with confidence and aspirations? They will most certainly not, if they absorb such messages.</p><p>In addition to tackling the violence that gets reported to authorities, we must also tackle its root causes at the cultural and social level of our communities. Blind acceptance of the portrayal of women in some sections of the media and the music industry could frustrate our attempts to deal with violence against women. We simply cannot let that happen, and it is our responsibility to speak out against it. If that unacceptable view of women is not tackled, it will spread unchecked and another generation will grow up with a distorted view of the relationship between men and women. This Parliament has a duty to all the men, women and children outside the chamber to do all that it can to prevent that.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20429456", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Women"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I give apologies from Stewart Maxwell, who was to take part in the debate but is, unfortunately, unable to do so.

I thank the cabinet secretary for introducing the bill, which I welcome, and the Justice Committee for taking the time to consider it and put together its stage 1 report and recommendations. I fully support the cabinet secretary's intention to take forward this wide range of criminal justice and licensing measures, which will modernise our laws in a positive way and make our communities safer and healthier.</p><p>At this point, I should say that I, too, have visited Cornton Vale, where one lady told me that she felt safer in prison, because outside it she had no recourse against violent partners and their families. I thank Ian McKee and Mike Pringle for their comments on that issue.</p><p>Other members have talked about crime and sentencing, but I want to focus on specific aspects of part 2 relating to criminal law. That part of the bill includes provisions to widen the scope of sexual offences prevention orders and to revise the statutory definition of \"obscene material\", measures that I believe will prove beneficial.</p><p>The bill will amend section 51 of the Civic Government (Scotland) 1982 to include extreme pornography within the definition of obscene material. Unlike \"classified work\", as defined in the Video Recordings Act 1984, such obscene material is solely for the purpose of sexual gratification, and includes images that explicitly and realistically depict extreme sexual acts that are a threat to life or would be</p><p class=\"indent\">\"likely to result ... in a person's severe injury\";</p><p>are forced as in, for example, rape; or feature other depraved activity. As such images frequently show abusive, disrespectful behaviour towards women, we must adopt the new framework in the bill to deal with such material and avoid the harm that it does to our culture, our society and women in general.</p><p>However, although the bill seeks to strengthen significantly laws that criminalise the pornographic exploitation of women, section 126 in part 8, which amends provisions in the 1982 act relating to public entertainment licences, falls short of recategorising the licensing of lap dancing clubs by taking them out of the alcohol licensing system. At the moment, such clubs, which represent another form of commercial exploitation that perpetuates the objectification of women as sexual <place-holder colnum=\"21674\"/> objects for sexual gratification, are regulated and licensed by our local authorities under an alcohol and entertainment scheme similar to that for recorded music or live entertainment venues. That is not only misleading but leaves authorities without the necessary power to decide where&#8212;and indeed whether&#8212;lap dancing clubs belong in their community or to refuse a licence.</p><p>As adult entertainment venues, lap dancing clubs that are seeking a licence should be subject to more scrutiny than other venues. I know that many councils and communities agree, and I hope that, at stage 2, the necessary amendments are lodged to ensure that local authorities have the power to regulate and recategorise such clubs not as public entertainment venues but under some new licensing category. We need to allow each local authority to regulate lap dancing clubs effectively.</p><p>In England and Wales, the Policing and Crime Act 2009 has reclassified lap dancing clubs as sexual entertainment venues, made licences more expensive, required more frequent renewals and taken into account the views of local communities. I welcome the provisions in that act, which demonstrate the need for a progressive stance on the issue in Scotland. It is important that we in Scotland look at the issues of lap dancing clubs and the effect that they have on their local communities. In particular, I have been forceful in trying to ensure that we have better regulation of lap dancing clubs in Glasgow. I hope that, if amendments on the licensing of such venues are forthcoming from wherever at stage 2, the committee and ministers will look on them favourably.</p><p>I conclude by expressing again my support for the bill and specifically the strengthening of the law on sexual offences.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20411092", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am pleased to take part in this debate.

In 2007, more than 2.7 million new cases were recorded, almost 400,000 of which involved children, and there were more than 2 million deaths. Although we often think that the problem does not directly affect us, the truth of the matter is that it affects us to a significant extent. The number of people with HIV in the United Kingdom has trebled in the past 10 years to more than 80,000. In Scotland, the general trend has been an increase in the number of people who are diagnosed with HIV, even though there was a slight fall in that figure in 2008. It would be encouraging if that were to continue and a decreasing trend were to emerge.</p><p>According to figures that were released just yesterday by the joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS and the data in the World Health Organization's 2009 \"AIDS epidemic update\", in the eight years since the UN Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS was signed in 2001, there has been a reduction of 17 per cent in the number of new HIV infections. Jack McConnell mentioned improvements in certain areas. In light of the motion, it is particularly heartening that the number of new infections in sub-Saharan Africa is approximately 15 per cent lower than the number in 2008. That is around 400,000 fewer infections. The numbers are startling, but that is nonetheless an improvement.</p><p>There have been more encouraging results. Only last month, the genome of the HIV-1 virus was fully mapped out. That paves the way for new and more effective drugs to be developed. In the search for a reliable vaccine, it was reported last month that a possible vaccine, which was tested in Thailand, had made significant advances. Of course, we all know that much work still needs to be done, but I also welcome the HIV action plan that the Minister for Public Health and Sport, Shona Robison, announced today. Among other things, that plan aims to improve the co-ordination of prevention, treatment and care activities across the sectors. I am sure that we all wish that plan every success. I also welcome the commitment that has been given that all the organisations that have been mentioned and organisations that have not been mentioned that help and support people with HIV will be given every opportunity to feed into the action plan. In summing up, perhaps the minister can provide us with details of how those organisations can be involved in it. The longest-serving HIV organisations in Scotland, such as HIV-AIDS Carers and Family Service Provider <place-holder colnum=\"21549\"/> Scotland, are to be commended for their services to carers, families, partners, friends and relatives who are affected or infected by HIV or AIDS.</p><p>The motion rightly says that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"positive consideration should be given\"</p><p>to Annie Lennox's gracious offer of her services to the Parliament in an ambassadorial role. Jamie Stone mentioned that the executive of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, of which I am a member, is actively considering the issue; we will continue our discussions at our next meeting. Mary Scanlon pointed out that a strange anomaly exists that means that the Parliament cannot use the word \"ambassador\". Perhaps the word \"envoy\" could be used if that is better, although I prefer \"ambassador\". Obviously, the minister is not an expert on constitutional matters, but perhaps she could check that out. The idea is good. Annie Lennox has offered to work in an ambassadorial role, and we should look forward to that.</p><p>I hope that we can move things forward and engage all stakeholders in the strategy, and I hope that the encouraging steps that are being taken internationally continue and that future generations will not be blighted by HIV.</p>", "hdate": "2009-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20410699", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: World AIDS Day 2009"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Jack McConnell on securing an extremely important debate, Annie Lennox on her   commitment, to which I will return, and Karen Gillon on the hard work that, as Jamie Stone mentioned, she has done for a number of years, and her involvement in Malawi, which I am sure she will mention.

My mum had dementia for a number of years. Although we went to visit my parents two or three times a week, including every Sunday when all the kids in the family went, we did not know that my mother had dementia because my father covered it up constantly. It was only after my father died that we realised that the reason why he had kept such a close watch on my mother was because she had dementia. For example, if he was going to the shops, he would tell her to stand at the window and watch. We used to think&#8212;unfairly now, we realise&#8212;that my dad was a bit of a control freak because he told my mother to stay there. After he died, we realised that that was for her safety, because she would have wandered out of the house otherwise. The stress and strain on my dad must have been tremendous.</p><p>Eventually, my mother could no longer live on her own because, unfortunately, she would wander out of the house at 4 o'clock in the morning. We tried to stay overnight at certain times, but that was not always possible because <place-holder colnum=\"20522\"/> we were working, so a care home was the only place that my mother could go.</p><p>My experiences of care homes, from visiting my mother and from visiting professionally through the cross-party group, have been a mixed bag. As members will know, there are very good care homes and some not-so-good ones. The sad thing is that many people in the care homes that I have visited have not had dignity. As Dr Simpson mentioned, they were not fed and they were left to sit. When they asked to go to the toilet, they were told they had already been.</p><p>In a number of care homes that I visited, people were treated abysmally. That experience was distressing, particularly when some of those people had no relatives to visit them. I became their relative and part of their family. People with dementia just want to be listened to. They would talk about the times way back, and sometimes I was their mother or sister, but that did not matter because they were happy that I was willing to give them my time.</p><p>There are several reasons why it is important that we have a charter of rights. One is to ensure that dementia is highlighted and that awareness is raised through advertising campaigns and leaflets in doctors' surgeries. If I had known that my mum was suffering from dementia, I might have been able to do more about it. There are lots of people in the same situation as my family and I were in.</p><p>We must also ensure that training is provided in care homes. There are some good care homes that stimulate people's minds and take them on outings. As Linda Fabiani said, perhaps they do not remember the outing the next day, but they feel better inside because of it. We must highlight the need for training.</p><p>Another important aspect is that, if we are to provide proper care, it must be proper care across the board. We cannot have a postcode lottery. The proper care must be provided everywhere and not just in certain areas. That is important and it is highlighted in the charter.</p><p>I am pleased that the minister has said that the Government will adopt the charter. As I said, dementia could happen to any of us&#8212;it could happen to me tomorrow or next week. I have met many people with dementia, including my mother. Some of those folk should have had a good quality of life&#8212;they should have had dignity and been treated as human beings&#8212;but they did not. It is important that, when the charter is launched, people are treated with dignity and as human beings.</p><p>Once again, I commend Irene Oldfather for the hard work that she has done to produce the charter, which is important. Her ideas will be put into every care home and doctor's surgery. I await <place-holder colnum=\"20523\"/> the minister's response to the debate, but I thank her for taking on board Irene Oldfather's suggestions.</p>", "hdate": "2009-10-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20207615", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dementia"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pay tribute to Irene Oldfather's tenacity and hard work in pursuing a cause that is very close not only to her heart but to many hearts in Scotland&#8212;after all, 69,500 people in the country suffer from dementia&#8212;and I thank the many groups who have worked on and helped to produce this very important charter.

I think that I should be able to give my impressions of it, and I hope that my views will be taken in the constructive way in which they are meant.</p><p>Further focus has been given to the active schools programme and the need for integrated local sports provision. Although I agree that those areas are important, I am concerned that the committee's considerations focused on a remit that, to my mind, put too much emphasis on the provision and development of formal sporting activities to the detriment of physical activity in general. That is despite the fact that, during phase 1 of the inquiry, when the committee took evidence from athletes, it noted that one reason for the falling off in participation levels was to do with social changes whereby, as Christine Grahame said, young children are less likely to play outside. That should have been looked at more carefully and in more depth.</p><p>Furthermore, the section of the report on the remit and evidence at phase 2 of the inquiry explicitly states at paragraph 24 on page 5:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The goal for the inquiry was to encourage physical activity in general\".</p><p>Physical activity in general was to be encouraged, but that was not looked at deeply enough. I agree with the minister that the provision of sport hubs that cater for all is one of the ways forward.<place-holder colnum=\"19623\"/></p><p>The report goes on to define physical activity as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"movement of the body that uses energy\".</p><p>It states that this includes, among other activities, play, gardening and dance.</p><p>Margo MacDonald mentioned girls. I say to her&#8212;I am sure that she will take my comment in the spirit in which it is intended&#8212;that the fit for girls programme was introduced by the Government to encourage girls to be more active. Jamie McGrigor and I were involved in discussing that when we were on the Equal Opportunities Committee. The programme has been welcomed and it has had positive outcomes for young girls.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, it seems that the physical activity aspect of the inquiry was overlooked in favour of more structured sporting activities, particularly those for young people, even though Scotland's national organisation for health information, ISD Scotland, has reported that two thirds of Scottish adults do not do enough physical activity. Once again, that should have been looked at much more closely. I am not criticising the committee, but we should be looking at these things in much more detail. The inquiry focused too narrowly on PE provision and younger people in general rather than considering the large percentage of the population who could benefit from an inquiry into how to encourage and make provision for increased physical activity, which, as the report states, could include housework and gardening. In my experience of my kids and others, those activities are not best enjoyed by youngsters.</p><p>We all agree, and the committee's report states, that the 2014 Commonwealth games give us a great opportunity to create a lasting legacy for the whole of Scotland and to raise the profile of sport and healthy living in general. Since the announcement on the games, I have received a great deal of correspondence from constituents who are keen to learn what the lasting legacy will be for their communities. I know that a lot of work is being done on that. Surprisingly, however, a lot of that correspondence has come from adults who are concerned about the lack of local places for youngsters and adults to take part in physical activity.</p><p>I am not using my speech to publicise it, by any means, but as a result of that concern, I and my colleague Bill Kidd launched a consultation&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20193629", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Pathways into Sport and Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I appreciate the explanation, but I still have concerns.

We sometimes travel together on the train from Glasgow to Edinburgh and we have long conversations about it. I know that her heart is very much in it. Christine Grahame is indeed a pensioner, and today is her birthday, but I will not tell members what age she is.</p><p>As convener of the cross-party group on older people, age and ageing, today's subject is of particular interest to me&#8212;as it is to fellow members of the cross-party group and to others. I take this opportunity to thank the minister for her attendance at today's group meeting, at which we discussed the forthcoming Scottish older people's assembly, which is to be held on 2 October in the Parliament. I hope that many attending the debate today, whether members or people in the public gallery, will have the opportunity to attend that assembly, which I think will be very important.</p><p>It has long been a goal of the cross-party group and other interested groups and individuals for older people's voices to be heard and for their needs to be addressed, and I am happy to say that I believe we are making real progress in that regard. Today's debate and the forthcoming publication of the Government's dementia strategy demonstrate that older people's voices are at last beginning to be heard. The older people's assembly will serve as the perfect platform for that to happen. Much of the proposed programme is directly related to the needs of an ageing population, its health, wellbeing and quality of life, and I hope that the older people's assembly will have the opportunity to feed into the Government's dementia strategy. Perhaps in her winding-up speech the minister will confirm that that will happen.</p><p>Much has been said about the medical causes of and possible remedies for the syndrome. Although remedies are, of course, to be welcomed, we must ensure that any strategy aims to provide whatever support is necessary to delay or minimise the onset and symptoms of dementia. A key aspect is the need for older people to lead active, engaging and rewarding lives, at home and in care homes&#8212;it is important that we address the situation in care homes in that regard.</p><p>I will give one example of why it is very important for people to lead an active life, whether in their home or in a care home. I regularly have the pleasure of visiting the Wing Hong Chinese elderly centre in Garnethill in Glasgow, where I frequently come off second-best at table tennis. Members might not think that that is very surprising, given my size and stature, but someone with a much greater stature&#8212;the First Minister&#8212;has also found himself on the wrong end of a ping-pong ball at the centre, having lost to a gentleman of 93 years of age. I have seen some of the most mentally and physically active older <place-holder colnum=\"19392\"/> people I have ever come across in that centre. They are absolutely amazing&#8212;93 years old, on a treadmill, playing ping-pong or checkers, or out digging the garden. That is fantastic.</p><p>We need to focus on the subject of keeping older people mentally and physically positive in their outlooks. I believe that, as direct result of their being mentally and physically active, older people can lead as full a life as possible and remain as full of life as possible. If we are to achieve our aim of improving the lives of older people, we must seriously consider how we can provide the stimulation and activity that are needed to promote healthy lives and mental wellbeing. I hope that the minister can address that point, which I know will be mentioned in the strategy. She said that she will take on board the issues that we raise, and it might be a good idea for her to visit the Wing Hong group and perhaps get a game of table tennis with that 93-year-old man, too.</p><p>As Irene Oldfather and others have said, there are people sitting in care homes doing nothing. There are gardens and equipment at some homes that are never used, and that situation has to be addressed seriously. Such cases have been brought to me, and I have seen others with my own eyes. I have visited care homes, not just when my mother was in one but through the cross-party group on older people, age and ageing. I have been shocked and angered to see some of the care that people receive. It is admirable to look towards better regulation and a higher standard of care in the sector&#8212;I would welcome those. However, I believe that it is by empowering older people&#8212;the service users in care homes&#8212;that we can achieve some form of lasting change. I would like the minister to talk about that when she sums up.</p><p>I recently spoke to Professor Alan Miller, the chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, about the human rights situation in many care homes. I was encouraged by the commitment of the commission to empowering people in care homes to understand their rights. We discussed the establishment of a human rights champion, who would be nominated by their peers and would ensure that everyone in the peer group understood their rights and had representation. I would be interested to hear the minister's thoughts on the idea, which she might feed into the strategy.</p><p>Dementia can affect any of us and it is imperative that there should be early diagnosis and treatment.

As I said, I do not think that it is the most important bill in the Parliament, but it is certainly one of the bills that I have spoken about and I feel is important. It is also historic. Lots of bodies have raised issues regarding the subject of the bill, as have the public and academia, because they have felt that Scots law is out of date in relation to rape and sexual offences. I thank the previous and present Governments for taking those issues seriously and enabling the Parliament to pass this bill in a consensual manner.

I think that Robert Brown explained the position, but I will try again to make it clear. The accepting of the amendments means the addition of fines, whereas Paul Martin is advocating that the accused be admonished&#8212;I wish that he would accept that point. We all agree that any sexual offence is a terrible indictment of human society. I would like Paul Martin to clarify in his own mind the fact that the fines would be an additional disposal and that the alternative is that the accused would merely be admonished. I wish that he would listen to that point.</p><p>My only regret involves the issue of consensual sex between young people of between 13 and 15 years of age and the threat that those young people might end up with a criminal record, which Robert Brown touched on. The matter might be outwith the remit of the Scottish Government, but I hope that we can return to it, as it is important, and that it will be part of the consultation with young people that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice mentioned.

Bill Aitken knows, as all of us in the chamber know, that the project board for the Glasgow community justice centre met in March and decided not to proceed with the service. That was the board's decision, not the Government's decision. It cheapens the member and others in this chamber to pretend otherwise.

It is with great sorrow that we are back here talking about job losses and about people getting sacked. I am sure that the management of Trinity Mirror will correct me if I am wrong, but I agree with Kenny Gibson and David Whitton that the group has used the Glasgow part of the operation, which made a profit of &#163;20 million to &#163;23 million, as a cash cow&#8212;a similar thing is happening in many other parts of the newspaper industry. Trinity Mirror is now using the present economic crisis as a reason to say that it cannot keep going and that there will be compulsory redundancies for various journalists&#8212;24 in the case of the <em>Daily Record</em> and the <em>Sunday Mail</em> . I have a real fear about that, which is why I am back here talking about it with great sadness.</p><p>I congratulate Kenny Gibson on securing the debate, because it is important that the issue is debated, whether three times&#8212;as has happened today&#8212;or 30 times, to ensure that the message gets across to the management that all parties in the Scottish Parliament are absolutely sickened and disgusted by its actions. I hope that the minister can get around the table with the management of Trinity Mirror and do something, although I have my doubts about the management.</p><p>I want to look at some practical things that I hope the Scottish Parliament can do. I said this morning that we have to look at employment law but, unfortunately, that is not part of our remit. Perhaps the minister in this Parliament could talk to the relevant minister in the Westminster Parliament about that; I would like that to happen if it is at all possible. We really have to look at employment law, because what is happening here <place-holder colnum=\"16808\"/> would not happen in countries with decent employment laws.</p><p>We got the Health and Safety Executive involved in the situation at <em>The Herald</em> and the <em>Evening Times</em>&#8212;no conclusion was reached, but at least people spoke to each other&#8212;because of the practices at the titles and the stress that journalists were under. I wonder whether we could get the Health and Safety Executive involved in the situation at the <em>Daily Record</em> and the <em>Sunday Mail</em>, too.</p><p>I want to pick up Ted Brocklebank's point about advertising. Given the record&#8212;excuse the pun&#8212;of the management and the profits that it has made from the two titles, if we gave it advertising money, perhaps it would just take the money and run. It might still end up paying off workers. I think that that is what would happen, so we should be careful about giving it the money. That is a great worry to me.</p><p>I know a lot of the people involved. It is not a conflict of interest to say that I have worked in newspaper advertising. Over the years, every politician develops a rapport&#8212;whether good or bad&#8212;with journalists. We get to know journalists. When they phone us on a Friday night at 10 o'clock we are almost certain that they will want us to say something off the record, and when they phone at a decent time during the day we know that they are phoning for a decent story.</p><p>The investigative journalism at the <em>Sunday Mail</em> is second to none. As Hugh Henry said in this morning's debate, it has been paramount in bringing down some of the worst excesses of gangsterism, drug dealing and so on, particularly in Glasgow. Without those investigative journalists, such criminals would virtually get away with murder.</p><p>My big worry is that we are losing excellent journalists. The journalists must be worried sick because they are losing their jobs and, like all of us, they have mortgages to pay for and families to keep, but when Kenny Gibson and I have spoken to them&#8212;last Friday and at other times&#8212;their big worry has been that journalistic expertise will be lost from the country.

I look forward to learning the outcome of the meeting, as it is crucial that we get the money as early as possible to put in place the facilities. We cannot wait until it is too late and find the facilities are not there.</p><p>With regard to the legacy that the games will provide, much has been said regarding material benefits to Glasgow's east end&#8212;Margaret Curran, Frank McAveety and others also mentioned that&#8212;and the economic benefits that will come as a result of these games.</p><p>I am encouraged by the unifying theme of the interim games legacy plan, namely that of the promotion of health. The five underpinning principles of the plan&#8212;enhancing partnerships, enabling diversity, ensuring equality, encouraging community engagement and embedding sustainability&#8212;are equally encouraging and very worthy, but we will need to establish clearly how they will be achieved. I hope that the final legacy plan, which will be launched this summer, will address those issues in full detail.</p><p>When it plans the delivery of those aims, the legacy plan delivery group should perhaps consider how we will</p><p class=\"indent\">\"establish joint working, from grassroots upwards\",</p><p>as stated under the principle of enhancing partnerships. That will be fundamental in delivering a legacy that is not only long lasting but for the people. We must also be highly vigilant in ensuring that the people who are meant to benefit from the games are not bypassed in the development and delivery of the legacy and that their voices are heard.</p><p>The minister mentioned the intergenerational approach, which is set out under the principle of enabling diversity. Every member who has spoken has rightly mentioned the benefits of the games to young people, but, as the convener of the cross-party group on older people, age and ageing, I am particularly interested in ensuring that the games deliver for people of all ages. I am happy to discuss with the minister the various views and ideas that have been raised at group meetings on how that can best be achieved. I should point out that when I talk about older people I am talking about 50 to 55-year-olds and over. Given the heart attack and stroke figures for not only the east end but the whole of Glasgow, it is important that <place-holder colnum=\"16767\"/> everyone has a share in the health aspects of the legacy.</p><p>I believe that the principle of encouraging community engagement is entwined with that of enhancing partnerships and will be equally important in creating a successful legacy. In the interim paper, the aim is for community engagement to rekindle a sense of pride, to revitalise local communities and to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"promote community ownership of the activities\".</p><p>I agree with Margaret Curran's point that younger people should be able to get in to watch the games either free or at a reduced price, although I think that that should apply to kids not just from the east end but from all over Glasgow.</p><p>If we are to deliver on the unifying theme of health, we must ask local communities what they need to improve their health and listen to what they say. Although I welcome the idea of sports hubs, which the minister elaborated on, and the proposal to encourage people to get involved in the competitive sports that will be featured in the games, I believe that we must not lose sight of this great chance to improve the general health of the people of Glasgow and, indeed, the whole of Scotland.</p><p>As the minister is aware, a number of respondents to the consultation wanted the legacy plan to refer specifically to support for the development of active play, adventure playgrounds and adventure activities. Moreover, in the young people's consultation, the number 1 thing that was wanted was for the games to encourage</p><p class=\"indent\">\"young people to become fitter and healthier\".</p><p>I could not agree more.</p><p>I regularly receive correspondence about the lack of facilities for young people, and I urge the minister and the group to ensure that, in finalising the legacy plan, they use the opportunity presented by the games to address such concerns. As Mr Finnie made clear, there is no point in leaving these things as a legacy if people in the east end and the rest of Glasgow cannot enjoy them.</p><p>Finally, the principle of embedding sustainability and the commitment to making the 2014 games the green games give Scotland a great chance to showcase to the world our belief that Scotland can be at the forefront of a green and sustainable future. There will also be an opportunity to redesign the built environment to improve the quality of life of communities, which might act as a blueprint for other communities across Scotland.</p><p>The potential is enormous. The task is not easy, but the results will be invaluable.

Last Friday, plans were announced for the creation of a &#163;90 million office, retail and leisure complex in the burgeoning financial services district, which will create around 2,500 jobs. As we know, the district used to contain warehouses and was the departing point for the Clyde ferries and Irish steamers during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Jim Fitzsimons, the chief executive of Capella Group, which is behind the investment, said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We believe the city is far better placed than most other UK cities to quickly come out of the current downturn\".</p><p>That is the opinion of a professional.</p><p>Another professional, Peter Wood, the boss of insurance giants Esure Insurance, recently announced the major expansion of the firm's Glasgow office and said that he wanted to bring the posts to his favourite city because of Glasgow's workers' can-do attitude. He claimed that he would \"need his head examined\" to do business in London, because of the city's high costs and transport problems. The two examples that I have given demonstrate that we are attracting major investors as a result of Glasgow's unique attractiveness and ability to embrace new technologies and opportunities.</p><p>However, more could be done. I welcome GARL, but consideration must also be given to high-speed rail and other rail connections and to road upgrades, for the benefit of Glasgow's wider community and Scotland as a whole. In that context, I agree with Des McNulty and other members that the Glasgow crossrail project has <place-holder colnum=\"16697\"/> been on the drawing board for far too long, gathering dust when it should have been gathering speed. Members might be interested to hear that I corresponded recently with the new chief executive of Transport Scotland, David Middleton. I was assured that the linking of rail services across Glasgow is a priority, that an initial meeting of the steering group has taken place to drive forward that aim and that the outcome will be known by June. Given the need for GARL and crossrail to be in place before the 2014 Commonwealth games, will the minister say whether minutes of steering group meetings will be published and whether the outcome of the group's deliberations will be available for the Parliament to debate before the summer recess? The 2014 games present a fantastic opportunity to create a lasting legacy and to showcase Glasgow's transport infrastructure to the world.</p><p>We all want the Commonwealth games to be as green as possible&#8212;I bow to Patrick Harvie on that. The games offer an opportunity to develop the city's green transport network. It is essential that when we consider the transport needs of Glasgow and the west, we include among the many priorities the need to encourage people to walk, cycle and travel by boat. It would be wonderful if we could open up the river and make it the dynamic asset that it should be, so that Glasgow's people and visitors could use it to get around and see what our beautiful city has to offer. Perhaps the minister will say whether such issues fit into his vision of the overall transport infrastructure in the future.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14940410", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport Infrastructure (West of Scotland)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I certainly support the member's call for investment in Dalmarnock.

The passing of the bill today will be a victory for all the people in Scotland who have actively pursued the issue.</p><p>Disabled parking has always been close to my heart, having had an aunt who was disabled for many years and an elderly mother who could not get about in her later years. I would have liked the bill to look at the blue badge scheme as a whole and at extending it to deliver a range of other concessions, for example in relation to off-street parking. However, I realise that the scheme is a reserved issue. Perhaps we can look at it again at some other time, if we get the powers to do so. If the scheme was extended to cover off-street parking, it would be much more enforceable. Perhaps the minister will address that point in his summing up.</p><p>Parking for disabled people has been the subject of a parliamentary debate and numerous petitions to the Public Petitions Committee, of which I was a member when they were lodged. I <place-holder colnum=\"15245\"/> remember when the committee met in Dunfermline in the middle of winter. People from disability action groups came all the way from Glasgow and Greenock in their cars to speak to their petition&#8212;that is how strongly they felt about the issue.</p><p>The subject was also discussed in the previous Equal Opportunities Committee. I see Cathy Peattie here, who was the convener of the committee when the subject was covered in our report \"Removing Barriers and Creating Opportunities\", which stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Committee also recommends that the Scottish Executive develop and promote suitable mechanisms for the effective enforcement of proper use of accessible parking for disabled people wherever it exists including encouraging local authorities to make full use of Traffic Regulation Orders.\"</p><p>The bill will confirm that statement. I am pleased to support the bill in its entirety.</p><p>Like other members, Karen Gillon mentioned the variation in costs, which go from the extremes of the sublime to the ridiculous. Glasgow's costs seem to be rocketing all the time. We must examine that and ask local authorities what their costs are. The costs that COSLA and local authorities have provided vary so much that it is not possible to say whether they are correct.</p><p>As Charlie Gordon said, financial costs should not take precedence over the human costs to people with disabilities. We cannot consider simply finance; we must look at the issue in the round and consider the human rights of disabled people. Financial costs are secondary to enabling people to live active lives.</p><p>What are the costs of being unable to park? Let us consider what we can do. Blue badge holders or members of other disability schemes who cannot park cannot, unlike us, get about and perform daily tasks such as going to the doctor, going shopping or attending appointments. They cannot get about socially to go to the theatre or the cinema, and they cannot participate in all the activities that we take for granted, because of the actions of selfish people. As David McLetchie said, if people will not behave considerately, we must, unfortunately, have enforceable legislation. It is unfortunate that, in this day and age, people do not treat others with humility and in the same manner in which they expect others to treat them.</p><p>I welcome the bill, which will be passed with the Parliament's full support.

I leave members to ponder those numbers. Disproportionate? I would say so.</p><p>Like others, I have visited Gaza. I have seen the refugee camps and I have eaten and drunk with the people, and it breaks my heart to watch the continued bombardment night after night. Gaza is a densely populated area in which the people have suffered greatly through the siege. Members might have seen a small red-haired boy during the television coverage. We spoke to that boy when we were there, simply because he stood out because of his red hair. I wonder whether that small red-haired boy is alive today to speak on behalf of the people of Gaza.</p><p>We met people on the streets and in hospitals, and we met kids in schools. Those kids said to us, \"All we want is a life the same as yours. We want to be free. We want to be able to study and move freely throughout our country.\" That is not too much to ask. Sadly, those kids cannot even attend their schools any more, because those schools have been bombed. As we have heard already, a UN school was bombed and 40 children were killed.</p><p>Yesterday, there was a three-hour cease-fire to allow aid to enter. That was a completely inadequate amount of time. How long would it take to get the aid in? How long would it take to get it to the right people? Furthermore, after the so-called truce, leaflets were dropped warning people to leave their homes or face air strikes. Following that, 60 air strikes were carried out. Where were those people supposed to go? Gaza is densely populated, and Gaza city is almost the same size as the middle of Glasgow. Where could those people go? Into the sea, which is patrolled by Israeli boats?</p><p>The UN and the international community have called for a cease-fire, yet they are ignored. What is the point of having institutions such as the UN if no one listens to them and no one obeys the laws that they create?<place-holder colnum=\"13791\"/></p><p>When we visited Gaza, the situation was dire. As the Deputy First Minister said, nothing was going in and nothing was coming out. Children were in incubators and people were on dialysis machines, and no one knew when those machines might be turned off because Israel controls the power. They had no fuel for ambulances to bring people to hospital. That was before the recent invasion; just think what it must be like now. Gaza is undergoing a humanitarian crisis of huge proportions. That must be stopped. There must be a long-lasting cease-fire, not just three-hour truces here and there, so that aid can be delivered to the Palestinians.</p><p>The situation cannot continue. There must be peace in the middle east, and there must be a two-state solution. There must be a Palestinian state, as people must be allowed their democratic rights. Bombing and killing people is not the way forward. I agree that both sides are engaged in killing, but the situation is disproportionate.</p><p>As I said, I see what is happening in Gaza on the television every night. I see the frustration of the people in Gaza and feel the frustration of people in Scotland and throughout the world. I visited a couple who left Gaza on the boat with us&#8212;an old man, whom we brought to Scotland for treatment that was unavailable in Gaza, and his wife. They now stay with their son in Riddrie in Glasgow. They are lovely people, and they gave me a warm welcome. I say to the people of Gaza that we want to give them a warm welcome.

It is one of the oldest newspapers in the world and has come a long way from its humble beginnings. In 1876, it was joined by its sister paper, the <em>Evening Times</em> ; more recently, it was joined by the <em>Sunday Herald</em> , which was launched in 1999.</p><p>Despite fears over the continuation of those proud traditions, the titles were sold off after the Competition Commission received assurances from Gannett. The commission stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Gannett said that it was committed to maintaining the autonomy of local editors, and planned to manage the titles locally in Scotland ... In our view, commercial considerations were also likely to deter any attempt to adopt a different approach for the titles ... As a final safeguard, we also believed that Gannett would not wish to risk its reputation (especially among competition authorities) with regard to any future inquiries into newspaper acquisitions by Gannett. We did not therefore expect the transfer adversely to affect the editorial freedom, editorial stance, content or quality of the SMG titles, accurate presentation of news, or freedom of expression.\"</p><p>In my view, the takeover of the newspapers has affected all of the aforementioned and put in jeopardy the hard-earned reputation of the titles for fairness, justice and freedom of expression. Indeed, I believe that when those issues were raised with John Hutton MP, he agreed that that was the case.</p><p>The draconian antics of management, which have resulted in journalists on all three titles being made redundant and invited to reapply for jobs in the new structure, call into question the assurances that were given to the Competition Commission and raise some serious points.<place-holder colnum=\"13735\"/></p><p>First, I ask the minister to consider making representations to the Competition Commission on the matter.

Let us be clear that the process will undoubtedly result in worse pay and conditions for staff, which is clearly unacceptable given that Newsquest made a profit of more than &#163;23 million in 2007, bringing its total profit since 2004 close to &#163;100 million.</p><p>The conditions under which staff find themselves working will also undoubtedly deteriorate under the new structure that is being proposed. That is particularly worrying given that a recent survey that was undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive revealed that, even before the current plans were announced, alarming levels of stress among production staff were being recorded in all areas, including demands, control, manager support, roles and the threat of change&#8212;not surprisingly, that was seen to be producing the most stress. Indeed, the survey indicated that, for six of the seven markers, urgent action was required to reduce stress levels.</p><p>It is wholly unacceptable that management are pressing ahead with changes that have not been thought through and which will lead to more stress among the staff. I therefore ask that the minister also consider asking the HSE to look into these deeply worrying proposals, which are clearly having a detrimental effect on staff health. We cannot expect staff not to be suffering under these terrible conditions&#8212;they were doing so even before they were told that they would have to reapply for their jobs, which they do not even know whether they will get.</p><p>The problem has been compounded by the lack of information given to staff. We learn that Donald Martin has set deadlines for staff to reapply for jobs without even giving them information about the jobs for which they are applying. Frankly, that beggars belief.</p><p>How staff have been and are being treated is unacceptable and, as has been noted, possibly illegal. I would be interested to know whether the issue of the legality of the group's approach to staff was raised at the minister's recent meeting with Tim Blott and Donald Martin, and, if so, exactly what was said. If the issue was not raised, I would ask the minister to raise it.<place-holder colnum=\"13736\"/></p><p>Let us be in no doubt that the titles and coverage will be affected. It seems that there are already plans to scrap the third edition of the <em>Evening Times</em>, which means that there will be only one edition available to the public to buy on the streets&#8212;the early morning edition; the second edition is for home delivery only. I understand that an edition of <em>The Herald</em> has also been scrapped. These are worrying times, not only for staff but for the readership.</p><p>It might seem strange to hear politicians standing up for the press, as we do not always agree with it. However, all of us truly value a vibrant and diverse press, even if it does not always write what we would like it to. There must be a completely democratic and independent press.</p><p>It struck me as strange that coverage of this important event has been somewhat muted. I urge all members of the media to stand together to highlight the owners' unacceptable approach and, by supporting the workers at the titles, ensure that other journalists and broadcasters do not suffer the same fate.</p><p>The process must be halted until the Competition Commission and the HSE are given an opportunity to deliberate on the matter and meaningful consultation is entered into with all parties, including the workforce of the titles and the National Union of Journalists.</p>", "hdate": "2009-01-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14551348", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Newsquest (Herald and Times) Ltd (Job Cuts)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Since its inception in 1783 as the  Glasgow Advertiser, The Herald has always been held in high regard for the quality of its journalism and its proud editorial independence.

His documentary tells the human story behind the many headlines. There is also some surreal comedy, as he is told that one of his donkeys does not have the correct paperwork.

We must take this opportunity to uphold people's rights in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and stand up for those who are being persecuted and denied the right to live in peace and freedom.</p><p>The situation in Gaza is dire. People have no food, schools have no equipment, hospitals cannot repair their equipment, electricity is cut regularly, and people are dying from lack of medication. Why? In a democratic election&#8212;let us remember that the election was democratic&#8212;the people of Gaza elected Hamas. Let me put the politics aside: those people are being collectively punished. No one gets in or out, and no goods are allowed in or out.<place-holder colnum=\"13591\"/></p><p>I therefore praise the people who operate the Dignity, enabling medicine to reach Gaza and allowing people who urgently need medical help to get out. Teachers and doctors are told that, if they go to work, they will receive no salary, but if they stay at home, they will receive $40,000. Why? Because Israel will not allow money to enter Gaza. The reason that Israel has given for that is that the crossings into Gaza are closed. Whose fault is that? Who closes the crossings? The Israelis&#8212;at the least, that is hypocritical.</p><p>I get very angry about this subject. What is happening in Gaza is nothing short of genocide and it must be stopped. We cannot let the situation continue. I welcome the statement from UN human rights delegates, in which they urged 100 measures to be taken by Israel, including ending the siege of Gaza. I sincerely hope that the Israelis take that statement on board.</p><p>Pauline McNeill has described exactly what we saw in Gaza. However, we did not see everything. More suffering is going on. The state of Israel was created 60 years ago. I ask the Israeli people to look on the people in Gaza and Palestine with humanity, as they themselves were regarded 60 years ago, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the bringing into existence of the state of Israel.</p><p>We cannot allow the situation to go on. The international community must heed the words and the suffering of the people of Gaza. A humanitarian crisis is happening there, and it will get worse. I do not want thousands of people in Gaza to die&#8212;at my hands, if I do nothing.

We do not allow them to work or to contribute to society and we hound them continuously, which leads to dawn raids, imprisonment in Dungavel and deportation. Those are not examples of respect for the dignity and rights of human beings.</p><p>Article 13(1) states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.\"</p><p>and article 13(2) states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.\"</p><p>In referring to those articles, I draw members' attention to the creation of the state of Israel which, by coincidence, is also 60 years old today. I will point out some of its actions that are against articles 13(1) and 13(2). In the west bank in Palestine, Palestinians do not have freedom of movement or the right to residence. Instead, they are confined to certain areas and must go through checkpoints that are manned by Israeli soldiers. They sometimes wait for hours at a checkpoint just to visit their families.

Such a case must never happen again. Protection of the rights of children must be paramount in any legislation and those rights must come before the rights of parents.</p><p>I want to concentrate on what we are doing in this Parliament to protect the people who I consider to be the most vulnerable in our society. Children do not ask to be born, but they are born. Further, they do not ask to be born into a certain lifestyle, but that happens as well. Their parents might lead chaotic lifestyles, be drug dependent or simply be unable to cope. That is why we, as a caring society, have put in place certain measures to protect such children. However, as has been said, sometimes those measures do not work. We must all ask whether we are doing enough or could do more. I hope that the debate will raise some questions and supply some answers.</p><p>Rhona Brankin's amendment calls on the Government to ensure that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"local authority funding for the care and safety of children more generally is properly protected\".</p><p>In that regard, I am quite concerned by the news&#8212;which I received last night&#8212;that the City of Glasgow Council has decided to remove direct and care services from council control, which could lead to the loss of 600 jobs. That decision will have a direct effect on the very vulnerable children we are talking about today. I ask the minister to instigate a meeting with the Councillor Steven Purcell, the leader of Glasgow City Council, on that matter so that we can ensure that vulnerable children are not further disadvantaged. It is important to do something about that right now.</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly with what Margaret Smith said about early intervention and continued support. That is where the child protection committees come to the fore. They have oversight of protection measures at local level and work in partnership with the police, social work, health agencies and others to ensure that support is put in place. However, it must be put in place as early as possible. If it is not, the child's life could be in danger. It is good that the child protection committees work at grass-roots level, and I believe that they are working well. However, nothing is perfect, and we must continue to monitor the committees to ensure that they continue to intervene at an early stage.</p><p>Foster parents do a terrific job, as Karen Whitefield said. However, their views are not always taken into consideration. I have spoken to foster carers&#8212;not just my sister&#8212;who say that they are not always listened to. One issue that arises frequently in my discussions with them is the length of time that children are kept in the care <place-holder colnum=\"12580\"/> system. The sad fact is that, by the time children get to the age of four or five, many people do not particularly want to adopt them. However&#8212;as was alluded to by Richard Simpson and Margaret Smith&#8212;the reason why they are kept in care for that length of time is that, time and again, they are sent back to their parents, who are trying to co-operate with the services, only to be returned to the care system when things do not work out. That must damage those children. Richard Simpson spoke about trust: imagine being a child who is learning to trust someone, but is taken back to parents, and then again back to carers. What long-term damage must that do? That is why we have such problems in the care system for older people. I would like the minister to consider that issue.</p><p>Another issue that I and others, including those who come to see me, constantly raise is children being given access to parents. Children are told that they are going to see their parents, but the parents often do not turn up to meet them. What damage does that do to a young child who had looked forward to contact with their parent? It does not always happen, but it happens time and again. Children turn up and wait, but the parent does not turn up and there is total damage. Obviously, such children are left in pieces&#8212;we perhaps pick up those pieces later. I promised the foster carers who I spoke to that I would raise such issues, and I would like the minister to consider them.</p><p>If possible, I would like the minister to organise or instigate a meeting, a conference or something else in which foster carers can express their concerns to the relevant departments and be listened to. Foster carers are at the coalface and must be heard for the sake of the children I see daily and other children who will come into the system. We cannot fail those children.

They should lodge an amendment, which we could then debate. Labour lodged an amendment to Patrick Harvie's motion on ID cards in 2005. Some Labour members expressed concerns.

However, clinical evidence suggests that research can be done on that aspect. Although we need specialist services for everyone who suffers from lupus, not just women, given that we have evidence that 90 per cent of sufferers are women and that the condition can cause miscarriages, we should focus the attention of specialists on that area. I ask the minister to take that point on board and ensure that we are able to make an early diagnosis of the condition.</p><p>A starting point would be to ensure that professionals are educated about the evidence that is available. Mary Scanlon and I have mentioned that 5,000 people are affected by lupus. The condition has various symptoms, but we know that it is correlated with recurrent miscarriages. I would like us to look at that issue.</p><p>Kenny Gibson said that many sufferers do not want to divulge the fact that they suffer from lupus. I want to tell members how I became involved with the issue. My involvement is not professional or personal. A young person, not long married, with a young family, discovered that they were very ill. The person, whom I will not name, was vibrant and had a good career in front of them. It took a number of months for them to discover, after various tests, that they suffered from lupus. That person is now in a wheelchair&#8212;not all the time, but now and again. It took many months for them to be diagnosed and to find out exactly what was the matter with them. They are still very cheerful, <place-holder colnum=\"12004\"/> but they now have to use a wheelchair or sticks. When we see such situations, it makes us wonder how many other people do not know that they have lupus, because the symptoms vary so much.</p><p>It is important that we look at research into lupus. We know how many people&#8212;more women than men&#8212;suffer from it. There is evidence on the condition, and people who do not know that they have it are continuing to suffer. It takes too long for them to be diagnosed. As Richard Simpson said, we should diagnose the condition early, so that people do not have to suffer so much. I ask the minister to take that issue on board and to consider providing specialist services. I agree with Ian McKee that we do not need to provide a single specialist service in Scotland, similar to the one that exists in England, and that we need to share information, to ensure that people are aware of the condition. Awareness and education are important.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14186675", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lupus"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Kenny Gibson for lodging the motion and enabling us to debate this serious issue.

I see that they are sitting together now, which is perhaps the best place for them.</p><p>As other members have said, the DRS equipment created an immense number of problems during the 2007 elections. I will give my experience of that. When I arrived at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre on the night, the first thing that I saw was people running about with cans of WD40&#8212;I thought that it was used only on motor cars when someone could not get their key in the lock&#8212;and spraying it on machines. The response of everyone in the SECC was, \"Goodness me&#8212;what the heck is happening now?\" We could not believe that they had to use cans of WD40&#8212;incidentally, they had to send out for them&#8212;to ensure that the machines were working properly.</p><p>That was an absolute disgrace and it shows that the electronic vote counting machines were not satisfactory at all. Voters were annoyed by the amount of rejected ballot papers, but all the candidates who were in the SECC that night were annoyed when we saw ballot papers clogging up the machines and people pulling them out from the other end. The system did not work and, like <place-holder colnum=\"11662\"/> Patrick Harvie, I hope that that is the end of that type of vote counting system. It does not work and it is no good to anyone at all.</p><p>After the elections, almost half the local authorities had to claim reimbursement from DRS after encountering a number of issues involving technical difficulties with the equipment or supplies being delivered late or not at all. For example, DRS had to reimburse the City of Edinburgh Council more than &#163;100,000 for the late delivery of ballot papers, which of course contributed to there being more than 10,000 spoiled ballots. Clackmannanshire Council's reimbursement was even greater than Edinburgh's because the necessary staff to operate the equipment were not supplied.</p><p>The situation was outrageous, not only because of the amount of money involved&#8212;the amount I spoke about is just the tip of the iceberg&#8212;but because of a catalogue of errors, some of which I have mentioned. The overall impact on the elections was huge, and I conclude that we should not use such electronic machines in the future.</p><p>Duncan McNeil said that it was unfortunate&#8212;to say the least&#8212;that DRS did not turn up to give oral evidence to the Local Government and Communities Committee. That was indeed unfortunate, because DRS should have been there, even though it submitted an explanation to the committee on paper.</p><p>I turn to the separate issue of equalities. I commend the committee for considering that issue in its report and discussing its role in the election process. As a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee, I believe that it is important that everyone should have the opportunity to exercise their democratic rights. In that context, I note that the Local Government and Communities Committee's report referred to research that found that there were inequalities in the election process, which was unfortunate for voters whose ballots were rejected.</p><p>David Whitton and James Kelly touched on the University of Strathclyde investigation, which was conducted by Dr Christopher Mason&#8212;sorry, he is a Glasgow Liberal Democrat councillor, as McNulty knows. I should say that the investigation was conducted by Dr Christopher Carman and Professor James Mitchell, who found a close relationship between the number of rejected ballot papers and the social context of a constituency. Relevant factors were the percentage of adults without academic qualifications, the percentage receiving unemployment benefit and the percentage reporting that they were not in good health. Those factors had not previously been considered together. I recommend that the findings of that report are taken on board.<place-holder colnum=\"11663\"/></p><p>As other members have said, the University of Strathclyde report also found that the percentage of rejected ballots was higher when there was a greater number of parties on the ballot paper, which obviously confused a number of people. There is no explicit recommendation to fix that problem, but the evidence clearly calls for the ballot paper to be redesigned. I remind members that the number of rejected ballot papers in some areas was the same as or higher than the elected member's majority.</p><p>The committee's report contains many recommendations. Although I do not have time to mention them all, those recommendations, together with the Electoral Commission's suggestion that we should involve people with visual impairments in the design of the ballot papers and other suggestions, are welcome and necessary if we are to ensure that everyone is able to vote and that people's needs are met&#8212;not just for politicians' sake but for the electorate's sake. We have a democratic duty to ensure that everyone can vote.</p><p>The Local Government and Communities Committee gave its view on improving equality in the election process by addressing the issue of candidates' names appearing in alphabetical order on the ballot paper, which might help people with literacy difficulties, for example. The committee also recommended including representatives from equalities agencies and organisations in election steering groups. That is a good suggestion because we must ensure that everyone is included.</p><p>Jim Murphy should think again and ensure that the Scottish Parliament has control over its own election process.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank the Local Government and Communities Committee for its report on what I would call the chaotic 2007 elections; I also thank all who gave evidence to the committee.

I will address some of the specific points in the motion, especially the call for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"National Lottery funding to be released as soon as possible\".</p><p>As I have said before, that is one of the most important aspects of the debate. Margo has described eloquently some of the problems that arise when people do not have proper sporting facilities. A lack of modern, up-to-date facilities forces young people to go elsewhere not just to train but to take up their chosen sport in the first place. That is not acceptable when we are looking forward to the 2014 Commonwealth games. Sometimes, the problem leads kids to drop sport <place-holder colnum=\"11191\"/> altogether. That should be of concern to all of us; it is certainly of great concern to me.</p><p>If we do not put the necessary facilities in place now, kids who hope to take part in the 2014 Commonwealth games will not be trained up in time to do so. I hope that Margo MacDonald will agree that that is the nub of her motion. Eventually, the lack of proper facilities will cause us to lose young people who are training at the moment. It will also discourage other young people who want to take up sport or exercise from doing so. That is why we say that we need the money that has been taken from Scotland to fund the London Olympics&#8212;our money&#8212;to put facilities in place right away.</p><p>In its reply to the Scottish Government's consultation on securing a positive legacy from the 2014 Commonwealth games, the Big Lottery Fund states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We believe the 2014 Games present an unprecedented opportunity for Glasgow and for Scotland. Quite apart from the sporting significance, there are very big potential gains in terms of community involvement, ownership, cohesion and celebration; grassroots participation\"&#8212;</p><p>that is very important&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"employment, employability ... regeneration of Glasgow and the wider region\".</p><p>Frank McAveety's amendment is eminently sensible; the Big Lottery Fund made the same points in its response to the Scottish Government's consultation. However, we need the funds now to enable us to bring about regeneration. Those funds have been denied us&#8212;they have been taken away from Scotland at a crucial time. We should not forget that, unfortunately, what has happened in the east end and other parts of Glasgow has been going on for 50 years, rather than just one, two or three years. If we want regeneration, we must take that on board.</p><p>I hope that Frank McAveety will pay attention to what I am saying, instead of having a conversation with another MSP, as I am speaking to his amendment. I agree with what he is saying, but the problem has existed for 50 years. Certain politicians must take responsibility for that. We are trying to turn the situation around. There are many good people in the east end of Glasgow and throughout Scotland but, as elected members, we have a responsibility, not just to the people of the east end or Glasgow but to the whole of Scotland, to present a united front to Westminster. We must lead by example and demand that the money that has been taken from Scotland at a crucial time be given back now, to fund regeneration and increased participation in sport. I hope that, regardless of our politics, we can move forward together and say that, for the good of Scotland, Glasgow and the 2014 Commonwealth games, we <place-holder colnum=\"11192\"/> need our lottery money now.

I think that we all agree on that, so I hope to get an answer on it from the minister.</p><p>We should remember that the Commonwealth games in Manchester received &#163;112 million of lottery funding for revenue costs and infrastructure.

I welcome this opportunity to debate this important issue and I hope to have the support of all parties in sending a clear, united message that the proposals for Glasgow passport office are unacceptable to the Scottish people.</p><p>Many issues could be raised, such as identification cards, passports for members of the armed forces and emergency passports, but I will not have time to cover them all. I expect that members will talk about such issues.</p><p>I welcome to the public gallery members of the Public and Commercial Services Union and I thank the PCS for its excellent briefing, which makes it clear that throughout the process serious concerns have been expressed about inaccuracies, contradictions and disregard for staff and customers in the Identity and Passport Service's approach. Those have been compounded by discrepancies in the evidence that the IPS provided to staff when they were told about the proposed changes.</p><p>Staff were told that the Glasgow passport office currently processes around 350,000 passports a year. However, according to a House of Commons written answer from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Identity, Meg Hillier, in 2005 the number was nearer to 600,000; in 2006 it was 650,000; and in 2007 it was 550,000. Staff were also told that Glasgow was chosen because of its small production capacity. However, in another written answer Ms Hillier acknowledged that the London and Belfast offices have consistently had lower processing figures. A serious issue must be <place-holder colnum=\"10073\"/> addressed. The figures do not add up and staff are being deliberately misled, which might call into question the legality of the proposed changes. Perhaps the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism will seek advice on that.</p><p>More sinister and worrying is evidence of a deliberate run-down of services at Glasgow. Again, the IPS and Ms Hillier have provided conflicting information. The IPS told staff that no decision had been taken on where postal applications would be sent. However&#8212;lo and behold&#8212;in response to another question, Ms Hillier said that 40 per cent of post office deliveries have been diverted from Glasgow to other passport offices since January, which is almost unbelievable. The two positions cannot stand up side by side. Questions must be asked about such discrepancies.</p><p>We are witnessing the deliberate run-down of services, a campaign of misinformation and a blatant disregard for the workers and people of Scotland. I hoped that if I expressed my concern directly to Ms Hillier I would receive a response that would enable me to come to the Parliament today with a glimmer of hope and faith that she is listening to the people of Scotland and to passport office staff. However, that did not happen, which is sad. I wrote to Ms Hillier in April, and only by constantly haranguing her&#8212;I am not generally known for constantly haranguing people&#8212;did I get a response, which was faxed to me today.</p><p>It is unfortunate that the response is short, dismissive and curt and contains more contradictions. It says that a decision has not been made. However, in the document that staff were given on 2 April, in answer to a question about whether the consultation period means that changes might not happen, it says, \"No. The board has taken the decision.\" That is contradicted by the response that I received today, which is ridiculous and would be laughable if it were not for the seriousness of the situation and the contempt that Ms Hillier has demonstrated.</p><p>I ask the minister urgently to seek clarification on the matter.

I thank the minister for his positive speech. Far from condemning children, he talked about the positive contribution that the majority of young people make to society. We must not forget that some of the children we are speaking about are as young as five and six. I acknowledge the issues that are raised in the Labour and Tory amendments and warmly welcome the motion. For too long, the youth justice system has been too focused on demonising and criminalising young people who commit offences. Although their behaviour is unacceptable, it is too simplistic to rely solely on punishment as the panacea for all ills. The time is right to consider why young people get into those situations and why too many of them cannot find a way out.</p><p>I hope that the Parliament will move forward together on the issue. I hope that we can reach common solutions to the problems, which affect all the constituencies and regions in Scotland. I welcome the Liberal Democrat amendment, particularly the points about the Mosquito device, which I believe goes against children's human rights. I thank Mike Pringle for his thoughtful speech. Youth justice is too big and important simply to be used as a means of political attack. Members must act responsibly and contribute positively.</p><p>We must put young people at the forefront of the policy decisions that affect them. It could be said that it is little wonder that young people act in certain ways when we consider the behaviour of some of those who are said to represent them&#8212;present company excluded, of course. We must take into account young people's views and concerns in our approach to the problems. A recent report by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child identified as one of its main recommendations the need to involve children in decisions that affect them. I would be grateful if the minister told us what steps the Government will take to ensure that young people's views are taken into account. I suggest that an appropriate starting point would be the current antisocial behaviour strategy review, which has been criticised for having no clear plans to engage young people. I ask the minister to comment on that in his summing-up speech.</p><p>Another key point that has been highlighted is about children's right to play. There are not enough activities for young people. As Bill Aitken mentioned, places where kids play&#8212;particularly parks in Glasgow, although the same is true in <place-holder colnum=\"9956\"/> other areas&#8212;are slowly being eroded. Many people I speak to mention concerns about the rise in youth crime and antisocial behaviour, but in the exact same breath they identify the solution and talk about a need for more facilities such as sports centres. As the minister said, young people need more things to do.</p><p>We can all agree that the Government's efforts so far to provide more opportunities are laudable. The cashback for communities scheme, which has been mentioned, is hugely successful and is a perfect example of how we can tackle the problems. We can fund projects to support young people who are at risk, such as drop-in services and outdoor activities. However, to return to my earlier point, such initiatives should involve young people at every stage of the process. It is not good enough, and is not conducive to helping young people, to build a basketball court and then bemoan the fact that no one uses it, or that young people just hang about in it. Did the young people want it? Did we ask them whether they wanted it? Did we involve them in the process? The key point is that we must involve young people. If we take that approach, new facilities will be successful and will, I hope, flourish. I ask the minister to consider seriously involving young people at all stages.</p><p>To tackle the problems of youth crime, we must also try to change attitudes to violence. As has been said, many young people grow up in an environment in which violence is accepted and is seen as a routine and ordinary part of life. We must consider certain activities that are covered in the media that may glorify violence and desensitise people to the reality. I give the example of cage wars, which involves two contestants locked in a cage battling it out while being bayed at by a huge audience. The event came to Glasgow twice last year and was widely condemned, including by Detective Chief Superintendent John Carnochan and me. We thought that it was highly inappropriate to have glorified gladiator contests in a city with some of the highest levels of violence in the UK. As a Glaswegian, I am not proud of that, but it is a fact.</p><p>I accept that these are contentious and difficult issues, but we must tackle them nonetheless. I hope that the Parliament will support us in doing so. We must take difficult decisions together, not just for the sake of the Parliament but for the sake of future generations, to change our attitudes and, perhaps, even the media's attitude to reporting on children. We never seem to hear good news from the media&#8212;it is always bad news. If there is anyone in the press gallery, I hope that they will look at good examples of what young kids are up to.</p><p>Every one of us wants Scotland to be a safer and fairer place. To achieve that, we must take our <place-holder colnum=\"9957\"/> young people with us and ensure that they see themselves as part of Scotland's future.</p>", "hdate": "2008-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13754986", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The debate is important.

It is important that we have that.<place-holder colnum=\"9246\"/></p><p>Like everyone else here, I cannot express how angry I am about the treatment that these women and children have to go through. It is inhuman and wrong that they are not protected and helped just because the Home Office labels them as having insecure status. They are human beings the same as us and they deserve to be treated the same as we are treated. They live and work in our communities and should be afforded exactly the same access to services as everyone else who lives and works here. To deny them that basic human right is to go back to the days when women were treated as chattels.</p><p>The situation reinforces the question, what other gender would be treated in this way? Amnesty International succinctly said that these women are being treated as \"Second class human beings.\" That would not be allowed to happen to any other gender, and we have to make sure that we get that across.</p><p>As Angela Constance and others have said, women come here with visas, some are students, some, unfortunately, are trafficked and some come on a spouse's visa. They think that they are coming here to have a life and contribute to this society, but inhuman Westminster legislation treats them as if they are chattels and slaves. As Angela Constance mentioned, countries such as Canada, America and Austria provide such women with help on certain aspects, albeit that in some cases they are allowed only a three-month stay in accommodation. In Canada, such women are given status after they have produced various documents. If other countries can do that, why can we not?</p><p>Basically, the Westminster Government is going against international law by failing to uphold the human rights of such women and children. I know that the issue is reserved to Westminster, but that never prevented us from considering Westminster issues such as refugee status. Many of us in the chamber today, including Johann Lamont and others, worked together to ensure that we got rid of some of the horrendous circumstances that applied to refugees, such as the voucher system. We pushed for those changes and we achieved a victory. Through pushing the issue together, we in the Scottish Parliament could secure a victory. We need to ensure that the Westminster Government realises that it is culpable if it does not uphold international law by protecting the women.</p><p>As Angela Constance said in her speech and in her motion, the Scottish Parliament should provide some form of emergency funding.

As Bill Butler said, the project has cross-party support. The minister might remember that I hosted a fringe meeting at the SNP conference on the subject of crossrail, which was the largest fringe meeting ever to take place at our conference. It had full support, and I do not think that we have had as large a fringe meeting ever since. I mention that to refresh the minister's memory.</p><p>I congratulate SPT on its work and its tenacity&#8212;Councillor Watson is in the gallery&#8212;in ensuring that crossrail has continued to be at the top of the transport agenda, not just in Glasgow but more widely since the Parliament's inception. I sincerely hope that we can move forward with the scheme. I labour that point, if members will pardon the pun, because crossrail has been debated to death and, as Bill Butler eloquently said, the time is right&#8212;the time has come.</p><p>We must ensure that the scheme is put forward for full implementation. I thank SPT for considering the issue in its entirety, and for its willingness to meet people from all parties and none and to examine the phasing of the project. Bill Butler mentioned that.

The system would benefit the whole of Scotland and&#8212;as Lord Foulkes said&#8212;it would benefit the Ayrshire Hearts supporters. I am sure that the Glaswegians will make Lord Foulkes more than welcome if he comes into Glasgow Central or Glasgow Queen Street station. I certainly will not be afraid to go to Ayrshire. I welcome the fact that Lord Foulkes realises that the project is not just for Glasgow; as has been said, it is a Scotland-wide project that will supply the pieces of jigsaw that have been missing for many years. The scheme is desperately needed throughout Scotland.</p><p>The scheme will help to create an integrated transport system for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. I believe&#8212;as I think everyone does&#8212;that such a system is long overdue. Glasgow 2014 has been mentioned. Although that is not the be-all and end-all, it is a golden opportunity for the crossrail project to go ahead. We hope that Glasgow 2014 will regenerate not just the Gorbals area, but the east end of Glasgow. Crossrail can help that regeneration by providing jobs and connections for the 2014 games.</p><p>I sincerely hope that the project will be included in the strategic transport projects review.

As the Labour amendment states, the previous Government is to be commended for the establishment of the HAI task force. The additional money that the cabinet secretary announced today and previously will be greatly significant in targeting not only MRSA but other virulent infections.</p><p>Incidence of MRSA has risen steadily over the years, as my colleague Michael Matheson and other members said. There are numerous reasons for that increase, but I will concentrate on just a few of them. A number of members spoke about the increase in drug-resistant infections, which has been brought about by the overprescribing of antibiotics. Nanette Milne targeted that point very <place-holder colnum=\"7343\"/> well in her contribution. I welcome the cabinet secretary's announcement on how we will monitor and tackle that problem. People have been used to going to the doctor and receiving antibiotics because of a perceived need. That has led to antibiotics no longer working and our being left with virulent infections.</p><p>Another area that gives cause for concern is the movement of patients between hospitals and wards. Not so long ago, it was much less common for patients to be moved from hospital to hospital or even between beds. Unfortunately, it is much more common now, which has something to do with the spread of infectious diseases.</p><p>Helen Eadie and Irene Oldfather mentioned the contracting out of hospital cleaning services, which has had a direct effect on the spread of infectious diseases. Staff are now paid less and less time is allocated to cleaning wards. It is certain that those circumstances have contributed to HAI. I hope that the cabinet secretary, or perhaps the task force, will look at that area. The one-year screening programme pilot will have positive results, but only as part of a coherent and integrated approach to overall hygiene in hospitals. That point was mentioned in the motion and recognised by the cabinet secretary.</p><p>I know that the cabinet secretary is aware of the different views about screening. I offer two examples. In Geneva, 3,000 patients were screened for MRSA and the conclusion was that there was no benefit in such a programme. However, three hospitals in America used screening for MRSA and the conclusion was that screening did work. That is why it is beneficial for us to run the screening pilot, which must be monitored and audited after a year, as was mentioned. The pilot scheme is most welcome.</p><p>The cabinet secretary spoke in her opening remarks about the appointment of nurse consultants. Could that role be enhanced to include targeted cleaning pilots? Ross Finnie raised that point, as did the HAI task force, which I think referred to the housekeeping monitoring group. Combined targeted cleaning, which would entail the cleaning of clinical equipment and the patient environment, including lockers and bedframes, would be extremely beneficial. If it is not possible to extend the role of the nurse consultant in that way, will the cabinet secretary consider a pilot of targeted hospital cleaning?</p><p>Nanette Milne and others spoke about the role of former matrons. We know that we cannot go back to those days, but it is important that hospitals are clean not only for patients and visitors, who are encouraged to wash their hands; the hospital environment must be considered too. Michael Matheson mentioned that services vary in hospitals. In a letter to <em>The Herald</em> yesterday, I <place-holder colnum=\"7344\"/> think, a lady said that she went to visit her mother in hospital and was appalled to see blood on the handrails of her mother's bed. That is totally unacceptable. Although it is up to the hospital management to deal with the problem, a targeted cleaning pilot would tackle such situations and they would not be allowed to happen. Over time, it would become the norm for hospitals to reach that high standard of cleanliness.</p><p>Everyone here agrees that patients must come first. They must have faith in the health service.

That was a fantastic achievement, but I am sure that we will overtake it at the 2014 games.</p><p>Given that the games will be seen all over the world, a major consideration for the bill must be to ensure that the image not only of the event itself but of Glasgow is a positive one. In that regard, I note the minister's comments on the provisions on the control of trading in the vicinity of the events. However, there is concern that section 7 could mean that currently licensed traders might be disadvantaged or financially penalised because of the games. Although I note the minister's comments about Glasgow City Council's role in that matter, can he, in his closing remarks, reassure traders that they will not be disadvantaged or penalised in that way?</p><p>I also ask the minister to set out the Government's plans for ensuring that existing businesses will not be affected adversely by the compulsory purchase powers that will be granted. Such concerns have already been raised with me&#8212;and, indeed, with other members&#8212;and although the minister has given some assurances on the issue I feel that those concerns still need to be addressed. Perhaps he will pick up on that point in his closing remarks.</p><p>With regard to the financial memorandum, the Finance Committee has strongly recommended that the Scottish Government pursue possible avenues of lottery funding. My colleagues will elaborate on the point later, but, as members will agree, it is shameful that because lottery moneys are being diverted to support the London Olympics, they are being taken away from the Glasgow Commonwealth games. It is to this Government's credit that it will bid for other lottery funding to ensure not only that Glasgow has a lasting legacy from the games but that people both in Glasgow and outwith the city will benefit. In light of the precedent set by the Commonwealth games in Manchester in 2002 and given what has happened with the 2012 London Olympics, I very <place-holder colnum=\"6346\"/> much hope and believe that this Government will secure the money for the games in Glasgow.</p><p>Given that the games will bring many business and employment opportunities, the establishment of a central point for procurement should be brought forward. I do not know whether other members have seen this, but the London organising committee's website has a dedicated section for companies to tender for upcoming work. The London organising committee has also established a business network that includes a UK-wide programme of business events. Has the minister considered such ideas and has he thought about introducing something similar for the 2014 games?</p><p>One of the games' greatest benefits will be the employment opportunities that they will offer. Indeed, there will be a tenfold increase in such opportunities, and we must ensure that they are not lost to the people of Scotland and that Glaswegians in particular are given the fullest opportunity to take part. Existing training and apprenticeship schemes must be developed to ensure that those who at the moment are not in employment, training or further education feel the games' benefits. Glasgow 2014 is for them, and they should benefit the most from the event.</p><p>Will the minister also consider making special provision for the active recruitment of volunteers with special needs and disabilities to assist in the smooth operation of Glasgow 2014? The issue has been raised in various cross-party groups, particularly the cross-party group on older people.</p><p>With regard to the need to make Glasgow 2014 inclusive to all, I echo Jamie McGrigor's point about disability requirements and believe that the bill should contain a requirement that new buildings, access provisions and transport comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Such a move will ensure that everyone can see and take part in the games.</p><p>As members have already mentioned, the games will provide a great opportunity to improve transport, and the creation of the so-called games lanes, which Glasgow City Council has said will be one of Glasgow 2014's lasting legacies, will I think be very appropriate for the people of Glasgow. Moreover, the Glasgow airport rail link will present a fantastic opportunity. However, one opportunity has been missed. Will the minister speak to the Minister for Transport and Climate Change, Stewart Stevenson, about the Glasgow crossrail project, which has been on the cards for 30 years and which could be up and running for 2014?</p><p>With Glasgow 2014, we have a golden opportunity not only to improve the health and life chances of all the people of Scotland but to show to the rest of the world that Glasgow's sporting <place-holder colnum=\"6347\"/> achievements are among the best. We must not and cannot fail&#8212;this is the opportunity of a lifetime, and we must ensure that we pass on to the people of the east end and of Glasgow as a whole a lasting legacy of life improvements. I am sure that, with the support of the Government's positive and ambitious programmes, people will see long-lasting benefits from the games.</p>", "hdate": "2008-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13399029", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I sincerely welcome this opportunity to talk about a bill for an event that we all want to succeed and which will leave a lasting legacy not only to the city of Glasgow but to the rest of Scotland.

That said, I take the member's point. However, my point is that the amendment belittles this debate. The issue could have been raised in other debates.</p><p>For too long, Scotland&#8212;and, in particular, Glasgow and the west&#8212;has been scarred by the activities of organised gangs that have terrorised the general public and have made huge profits from others' misery. As a result, I welcome not only this debate but the cabinet secretary's recent announcement that he will crack down on the use of taxi firms for money laundering purposes by making it easier for councils to limit the number of private hire cabs.</p><p>I also welcome the proposal for legislation to regulate security firms, which, as most of us know, have some very high profile clients. We all recall the conviction last year of James Stevenson, who, as Pauline McNeill and Bill Aitken have pointed out, was sentenced to more than 12 years for his part in money laundering activities, which included the setting up of a taxi firm. Moreover, Tam McGraw, who died last year leaving a fortune estimated at &#163;14 million, laundered money through taxi firms and security companies. We should welcome the length of the sentence imposed on Stevenson as a clear message that we will not tolerate those who participate in organised crime. <place-holder colnum=\"4821\"/></p><p>Indeed, the courts should make a commitment to take such a view in future, as only through our taking a consistently tough line on sentencing can we hope to deter others.</p><p>I also welcome the cabinet secretary's commitment to crack down on the use of tanning salons for money laundering purposes. I have raised this issue many times over the years, particularly in relation to unmanned salons where unsupervised and uninformed people simply put &#163;1 into a machine. No one checks their age or, indeed, what they get up to, and I assure the chamber that some salons have been closed down because of the unsavoury practices that have taken place in them. I look forward to hearing more on that matter from the cabinet secretary.</p><p>By bringing together different agencies and bodies in the fight against organised crime, the serious organised crime task force will be highly effective in achieving our desired aims. For too long, criminals have been able to operate because intelligence on their activities has not been as widely available to other agencies as it might have been. As Bill Butler and others have pointed out, through this platform of co-operation the task force will be in a perfect position to work with its UK counterpart, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and Europol, to fight and respond to the threat of organised crime on an international level.</p><p>As the motion makes clear, more than &#163;17 million has already been recovered through the provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. However, although that situation should be welcomed and applauded, it can be improved on. In fact, in response to a question on 15 November 2007, the First Minister said that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we are actively looking at what improvements can be made\"</p><p>to those provisions and that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We are also considering ways to increase the value of assets seized.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2007-11-15.3470.6\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 15 November 2007; c 3470.]</citation></p><p>I welcome both that statement and the cabinet secretary's on-going dialogue with Westminster. In that respect, I wonder whether the cabinet secretary is able to give us some idea of when he will announce what improvements can be made to the 2002 act to ensure further that criminals get the message that we will not tolerate their activities and that they will not benefit from them.</p><p>The cabinet secretary also mentioned that the Government was working with several organisations on using recovered assets to help young people throughout the country and on drawing up specific funding proposals to increase available opportunities. I would be grateful if he could provide us with an update on how those plans are progressing. After all, investing in a <place-holder colnum=\"4822\"/> positive future for our young people is the best guarantee that they will not turn to crime in the first place. Of course, we must ensure that any money for such initiatives makes a real difference to the lives of the people that they target. I am interested in finding out how that will be achieved.</p><p>We will debate the legislative consent motion on the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill next week. I hope that the money that will be raised through its provisions and which will be administered by the Big Lottery Fund with guidance from ministers will be used specifically for local initiatives aimed at helping more young people to become involved in activities and projects of interest to them and their community.</p><p>By sending out the message that criminals will receive the maximum sentences that are available to the courts and that they will not profit from their activities, we are going down the right road. By coupling that message with the bringing together of the crime agencies to hunt down those criminals, we will take the fight to the criminals who are blighting our communities.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395119", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Serious Organised Crime"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not want to know about the Liberal Democrats' manifesto commitments, some of which certainly have not been taken forward.

This is a very important subject that has caused great concern not just in the Pakistani community in Glasgow, but throughout Scotland.</p><p>I wish to pick up on an issue that Bill Aitken raised. I know that members' business debates tend to be conciliatory, but I cannot let this pass. Bill Aitken said that it is not for us to intervene in another country's affairs, but for the people there. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned&#8212;we did intervene in other countries' affairs not that long <place-holder colnum=\"4538\"/> ago, and we are suffering the terrorism aspects of that now. I feel that I had to say that.</p><p>Hugh O'Donnell touched on the history of Pakistan. I, too, want to give a wee bit of background. We are all aware that the country has had a troubled past since its creation through the partitioning of British India. More than 100,000 people died in the early days after partition, through communal violence. The Indo-Pakistan war followed in 1947, as a direct result of the flawed partition. It was the first of four wars between India and Pakistan over territorial disputes, which are still a source of great tension today. The last, in 1999, was considered an unmitigated disaster for Pakistan, and many people believe that it led General Musharraf to stage a coup, after receiving criticism for his part in the Kargil war. It was claimed that he went on to bury a report on the conflict.</p><p>It is essential that the Pakistani people's faith in their right to determine their future is restored. The people have suffered a great deal in their desire for democracy. As Hugh O'Donnell and I have mentioned, we are a part of that history on account of the time of the British empire&#8212;which I would put in inverted commas. Because of that, we have a duty to support the Pakistani people's call for free democratic elections. It is important that we highlight the present situation.</p><p>I express my concern about reports, which I learned about today, that suggest that prospects for a free and fair general election in Pakistan next month are very poor, and that a rigged result could lead to more instability and play into the hands of Islamist militants. It seems that although the international pressure to hold a general election has been bowed to, it will not be free and fair, as the motion rightly calls for it to be. That is very worrying for the future of Pakistan, as it could fuel unrest and lead to a rise in support for other groups.</p><p>We have had assurances from President Musharraf that there will be a fair election, but a weak caretaker Government such as his, a tame judiciary and restricted media freedom do not bode well for the election or for the future of Pakistan. I think that we can do something for the people of Pakistan, and I hope that by our actions today we can send out a clear message to the UK Government that more action must be undertaken to ensure that the general election is fair and transparent.

Sometimes that leaves them wading through numerous agencies in the hope that they can reach the correct one and get much-needed help. That is why I welcome the proposal for a specialist information service for all kinship carers that would give much-needed advice. I also welcome the involvement of Citizens Advice Scotland.</p><p>When the minister sums up, will she reply to the question that Christine Grahame asked on whether there will be a partnership with local government? Obviously, ministers will be aware, as members are, that the services that local authorities provide vary greatly area by area. Mary Mulligan and other members also made a relevant point about kinship carers' payments being made through local government social work departments. I would like clarification on both those issues.</p><p>I raise those two issues because of a number of constituency cases that I have dealt with&#8212;I am sure that other members have had similar constituency cases. I know how difficult it is to extrapolate the relevant information. I will give an example of a recent case in which I was involved.</p><p>An elderly gran who was the carer for her grandson did not receive any benefits whatsoever&#8212;her only income was her old-age pension&#8212;but she supported her grandson through thick and thin. She did the best that she could to <place-holder colnum=\"4105\"/> provide him with a safe and stable environment to the extent that she used part of her pension to pay for after-school care. Eventually, she could not continue to do so, given the money that she had, and she found it almost impossible to get the help that she and her grandson deserved. Fortunately, through contacting various agencies, we were able to help to guarantee funds for after-school care. Those funds are guaranteed only until March 2008, but I hope that what is proposed will help that lady and others who are in the same position.</p><p>I thank Glasgow City Council for providing that help through a vulnerable families fund. Without that, the lady's grandson, who had led a chaotic lifestyle in difficult circumstances, would not have help and would not be able to mix with other children. That helps him emotionally and helps his grandmum emotionally, as it gives her much-needed time on her own when she knows that the kid is being looked after.</p><p>The woman who I have mentioned is one of thousands of people who care for and nurture children. Often, they rescue those children from a chaotic lifestyle. We must not forget the important point that those people save Governments thousands, if not millions, of pounds by preventing kids from going into care. We should not deny those people the same right as others have.</p><p>I thank the Government for these important and welcome measures and I look forward to their introduction.</p>", "hdate": "2007-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13393641", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fostering and Kinship Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will do my best to cut short my speech.

There will always be new challenges to overcome and there are some challenges that have been going on for a long time without having been resolved.</p><p>I want to concentrate on equal pay, which other members have talked about. The Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970, but today many people are still fighting for the right to equal pay. Bill Kidd mentioned that the pay gap between men and women has increased since then. The situation that exists 37 years after passing the act is unacceptable and must be tackled. For far too long, women have been employed in low-paid part-time jobs. I agree with Hugh O'Donnell's words about stereotyping in employment and I assure him that the SNP Government is committed to challenging that serious issue. Equality of pay, conditions and opportunities must be at the forefront of any skills strategy, so that we can ensure, for example, that as many women as men take up apprenticeships and that the drop-out rate for women, which is greater than it is for men, after a couple of months, is examined. I ask the minister to ensure that that is looked at.</p><p>In 2001, Wendy Alexander, in answer to a parliamentary question on equal pay in the further education sector, referred to a guidance letter in which she had written:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"staff are the key resource ... and we must continually strive to improve people management, staff development and succession planning.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-11-15.S1W-19620.h\">[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Written Answers</em>, 15 November 2001; S1W-19620.]</citation><place-holder colnum=\"3826\"/></p><p>I will avoid commenting on Ms Alexander's powers of people management, staff development and succession planning, but I agree with her remark.

They want transparency and openness to ensure that the situation does not arise again and that the bullying and intimidation that occurred in Milton and in Chirnsyde over the years never happens again.</p><p>I join Bob Doris in thanking the media, and the <em>Sunday Mail</em> in particular, whose voracious appetite for the truth kept the Chirnsyde story on the front pages. It made sure that the activists, who were desperate for some truth and transparency, were able to turn to someone. Without the <em>Sunday Mail </em>exposing what was going on in Chirnsyde, it would have disappeared from the public eye.<place-holder colnum=\"2556\"/></p><p>I first visited Chirnsyde when I was elected in 1999 and went there often. I also often visited Maryhill police station&#8212;so often that I think I was there more frequently than Glasgow's finest. I met community groups and individuals in the area, as well as Glasgow City Council. I was going to bring in my correspondence today, but it amounts to four box-loads and would be too much to bring into the chamber.</p><p>Bob Doris has given a report of some of the incidents that took place in Milton. The confidentiality that I owe to constituents prevents me from raising other incidents, including intimidation and threats by certain people who have been mentioned and by others who have not. From 1999 until a couple of months ago, certain people had a community minibus, which they drove around Chirnsyde while wearing bullet-proof vests. We all have ice cream vans and community buses visiting our areas. I did not know where they had got the bullet-proof vests from, but they were driving the community bus while wearing them. One has to ask to why.</p><p>When the recent shootings that Bob mentioned took place, I again asked Glasgow City Council to intervene and remove the minibus from Chirnsyde and close the community initiative. I was told that the council could not do that because it had no jurisdiction over the management committee of the Chirnsyde community initiative.</p><p>That community activists can do something is great, but questions must be answered when we reach the stage at which the council can do nothing about people wearing bullet-proof vests running about in minibuses. I have looked for answers. In fact, until the council recently impounded that minibus as a result of pressure from the local community relating to health and safety matters, it was being driven along the road to pick up kids to go to football clubs, and people were still wearing bullet-proof vests.</p><p>I conclude in the same spirit in which I started. We want a fresh start for Chirnsyde and Milton, but people must be accountable for their actions. I reiterate: we want truth and transparency about what has happened in the Chirnsyde area. It cannot be allowed to happen again. As elected members, we must ensure that our communities are safe. When communities come to us, we must ensure that they are given answers to the serious problems that they have raised.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13389745", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chirnsyde Community Initiative"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Bob Doris on securing the debate.

In particular, I praise Gary Gentle for the excellent work that was done and for the comfort that was provided to many people. As Patricia Ferguson said, Community Central Hall in Maryhill was open for 24 hours on those days. Staff sometimes went for 24 hours, or even longer, without any sleep, just so that they could offer food, tea and coffee and could provide basic comfort. They set up an incident room so that people could have access to emergency telephone calls from the police and the ambulance service. Those people cannot be praised highly enough for the comfort that they gave to suffering people.</p><p>I went along&#8212;Patricia Ferguson was there too&#8212;to talk to people who did not know what had happened to their family members.

That is why we need a public inquiry. Lots of questions need to be answered, and we need to ensure that such a tragedy does not happen again. In a public inquiry, questions would have to be asked of the HSE's role in the matter. Were assessments properly carried out? Were workers' concerns listened to? Should spot checks be carried out by the HSE?

I also thank the Scottish Government for setting out its position on asylum seekers, which I am happy to say echoes the changes that are called for in the motion.</p><p>I welcome the people who should be in the public gallery by now&#8212;they must have been delayed; they are travelling through from Glasgow&#8212;many of whom have first-hand knowledge of the many difficulties that asylum seekers face. I hope that other people in their position and organisations that work with them, such as the Scottish Refugee Council in Glasgow and other voluntary organisations, will take heart from the fact that the first members' business debate after the summer recess will highlight the fact that in Scotland the situation of asylum seekers is an issue of the utmost importance and one that is taken extremely seriously by the Parliament.</p><p>Today I will concentrate on the motion before us and, in particular, on what it says about the right to work. Simply by granting asylum seekers the right to work, we can radically change how they are perceived and the conditions in which they find themselves. It is clear that granting asylum seekers the right to work offers fundamental benefits. Rightly or wrongly, many people perceive asylum seekers to be a burden on society and think that their sole purpose in coming to Scotland <place-holder colnum=\"1414\"/> is to claim benefits, to the detriment of society as a whole. As we all know, such attitudes lead to a fractured society, in which asylum seekers are viewed with distrust and, often, open hostility.</p><p>Members of the Scottish Parliament and people outside the Parliament have worked and continue to work towards creating a Scotland that is free from prejudice or hatred. To that end, let me dispel the myth that asylum seekers are simply benefit seekers. Asylum seekers want to work. Research shows that the money generated for the local economy by asylum seekers would far outweigh the cost of benefits. The message is clear: by granting asylum seekers the right to work we can help to grow the economy and, which is more profound, help to create more harmonious communities throughout our areas.</p><p>Many asylum seekers are highly skilled. Recent United Kingdom figures show that more than 900 doctors, 150 nurses and 100 dentists are unable to seek work. The current skills shortage in some professions, especially in health, has led to a bizarre situation in which recruitment schemes are run abroad. We could go some way towards solving the problem if we granted asylum seekers the right to work. The Scottish Refugee Council said that a change in policy would have a major impact on people's future integration into Scottish society. That conclusion is borne out by research that was carried out by the previous Scottish Government, which found that denying asylum seekers the right to work increases the risk that their skills will become outdated, increases isolation and makes it less easy for people to be integrated into the labour market. We cannot let a situation continue that leads to public mistrust, represents a missed opportunity to grow the economy, perpetuates the skills shortage and risks alienating people who will eventually be granted asylum.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government's support on such matters and I thank Fiona Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, for writing to me to outline the Scottish Government's position, which is to press for full implementation of the March 2006 agreement; to ensure that young people from asylum seeker families have the same access to full-time education as is afforded to Scottish children; to call for families with children who arrived before March 2006 to be granted leave to remain; and to press for alternatives to the much-deplored dawn raids and to the unacceptable detention of children and their families.</p><p>The motion refers to the right to work and to an amnesty for families who arrived in Scotland before 2006. I will raise wider issues, which no doubt other members will mention in more detail. As I said, by effecting change we can continue to <place-holder colnum=\"1415\"/> work towards creating a Scotland that is free from prejudice or hatred. We can also work towards a Scotland in which inhuman treatment of anyone is not tolerated, by ending the barbaric treatment that many asylum seekers face at the hands of the Home Office.</p><p>I have seen at first hand the effect of Home Office policy on asylum seekers. People become depressed because they cannot work, which affects their families and communities. Some asylum seekers have been in Scotland for many years. Their children were born here and they have formed friendships and relationships. Many asylum seekers regard themselves as Scottish, yet they live in fear of dawn raids, detention and deportation. We must end those barbaric practices and ensure that an amnesty is granted to families who have become valued members of their communities.</p><p>For too long, asylum seekers have been regarded as people who arrive here with no hope. I want to give families the hope that in future they can be valued members of Scottish society. Scotland is held in high regard throughout the world, but the use of dawn raids and the detention centre at Dungavel seriously calls into question our claim to be warm and welcoming. Will the minister consider the issues that I have raised? Will he also consider the situation at Dungavel, especially in the light of the alarming reports in today's press, in which it is claimed that children are being held alongside criminals&#8212;rapists and traffickers&#8212;awaiting deportation. Even today, after such reports, the Home Office refuses to give figures on detainees.</p><p>Members of the Scottish Parliament pride themselves on fulfilling their duty to ensure that there is justice, fairness and accountability to all people in Scotland. Asylum seekers deserve no less. When the minister responds, I ask him to give further information on the legacy review that is going on. I presume that we will hear the results by the end of the month or in October, but we have received no update on the cases involved. Will the minister also tell us about the correspondence between&#8212;I think&#8212;the First Minister and members of the Westminster Government? Is there, as I believe, a perception that doors are opening for the Scottish Parliament and at Westminster?</p><p>Too often, asylum seekers do not get an opportunity to put their case.

In February, at stage 1 of the bill, I expressed concern that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's rejection of Alimta would lead to the drug's being withdrawn in <place-holder colnum=\"614\"/> Scotland, given that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland had never before gone against NICE guidance. However, the high incidence of the disease in Scotland means that NHS QIS would be in an excellent position to reject any such advice that was offered by NICE. In this instance, it would be quite right to do so and NHS QIS would, based on the vote not so long ago on treatment of mesothelioma, have the support of 93 per cent of Parliament.

I was not involved in that instance, but I knew of the incidents there when I lived in the area.</p><p>Like Gil Paterson, I was a bit sceptical when I first saw the proposals about tagging and releasing pictures of sex offenders. However, when I looked into the matter, I realised that these people are devious and that we must do something to prevent them from reoffending and evading the law. Therefore, I whole-heartedly welcome the proposals that the minister has outlined.</p><p>In particular, I welcome the traffic-light system, which will enable the police and procurators fiscal to act much more quickly than they have done before to inform and protect communities. We are here to protect communities and to ensure that sex offenders do not commit further evil deeds, so I hope that the traffic-light system will be rolled out <place-holder colnum=\"570\"/> across Scotland. For too long, the approach of not just the police but procurators fiscal towards sex offenders has been seen by the public as piecemeal. People have seen that the legislation is not particularly coherent and joined up, so I hope that the legislation that the minister proposes will have a much more coherent and joined-up effect.</p><p>We need to ensure that the proposed legislation is adequately funded, and I ask the minister to make a commitment in his closing speech to give adequate funding to the agencies that are involved in dealing with sex offenders. Too often, we introduce specific proposals but, when we speak to the agencies that are involved in implementing them, they say that they do not have the funding to do so. I would like a commitment that funding will be put in place.</p><p>The minister mentioned housing in the community. Will he consider seriously the allocation of housing to sex offenders to ensure that the housing provided is not near schools or nurseries and that we do not end up with groups of sex offenders in particular areas of the city? Groups of offenders are often housed in the most deprived areas, although I will not name them.</p><p>As Gil Paterson said, we are talking about heinous crimes that are committed by people who often groom their victims; I read about an offender who groomed single mothers to get to the children. Most adults would not condone that. Given how serious the issue is, legislation by this Parliament must be considered carefully. Will the minister consider creating a specific sex offender sentence and providing for supervision for life in certain circumstances? As I said, sex offenders try to evade the law and, in certain circumstances, they should be supervised for life if they are not jailed for life, because they are a danger to communities.</p><p>Will the minister consider providing for sex offenders to serve at least three years&#8212;depending on the severity of their crimes&#8212;before they are given a parole hearing, rather than being released automatically? I know that that is a touchy subject among various agencies and politicians alike, but, if we are going to consider the issue seriously, we cannot say that such offenders could be sentenced to four years but be released automatically after two years. That is not acceptable in this day and age, given what is happening in communities.</p><p>I ask the minister to take on board my suggestions. If he cannot respond when he sums up, I ask him to send me a letter or to arrange a meeting with me to discuss them.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384622", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sex Offenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The subject of sex offenders, particularly those who abuse children, is emotive.

Surely, by his own admission, those moneylenders must also be considered.</p><p>Many forms of loan shark have been mentioned. In that context, I want to talk about my personal, first-hand experience from when I worked in various areas in Glasgow and Paisley. I want members to know how moneylenders operate. When I worked in the east end of Glasgow, there was a shop&#8212;which I will not name&#8212;that kept family allowance books in a drawer. Therefore, families or mothers had to use that shop. The prices were extortionate, but it was the only shop that they could use. That was one form of moneylending. Obviously, there were terrible consequences for the families that were involved and for the community at large.</p><p>In Paisley, long queues of moneylenders would wait outside post offices to take money or benefits from people collecting their money or benefits. The police were eventually called.</p><p>Those are two examples from my first-hand experience of illegal moneylenders or loan sharks, but such things still happen today. Money is taken from people not only on street corners, but in front of shops and post offices, and families are left destitute. They have no money left for clothes, food or anything else. I welcome the figures that <place-holder colnum=\"32624\"/> the minister gave in reply to the question that Stewart Stevenson asked, but such things still happen, and it is a terrible indictment of today's society that we must put up with such moneylending.</p><p>Credit unions, citizens advice bureaux, Money Advice Scotland and other organisations have been mentioned. I agree that those organisations do an invaluable job and I welcome the loan-shark hunters&#8212;I think that that is what they are called&#8212;because we need to protect people from illegal moneylending, which can have terrible consequences for them.</p><p>I turn to the Scottish National Party's amendment. Kenny McAskill was right about the effects of the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc (Scotland) Act 2007. People's houses can be taken off them as a result of debts of as little as &#163;3,000. Sometimes the debt will not even be of their own making. I will give an example. Hundreds of people are being taken to court for debts of between &#163;3,000 and &#163;7,000 relating to bills for repairs to their houses. I am sure that the minister knows what I am going to say next. Those people did not ask for the repairs to be done, they did not want them to be done and they could not afford them. However, Glasgow Housing Association, which the Labour Government set up, is taking them to court.</p><p>The GHA is a predatory company. It insists that people pay for things within a year and says that, as it is a charitable institution, it cannot afford to extend payment periods. Even Communities Scotland has said that that is not the case. Will the minister, in summing up or in an intervention, confirm to people who are suffering under the GHA that that is not the case? The GHA is taking people to court to pay back money within a year, which may lead to bankruptcies. People could lose their homes under legislation that the Labour Government passed.</p><p>The minister cited Lloyds Bank as an example of a good creditor. However, the funny thing is that that is the very bank that the GHA advises people to go to for the &#163;5,000, &#163;6,000 or &#163;7,000 loan that they need to pay back GHA because it has refused to extend payment periods. I am not one for conspiracy theories, but I certainly want the minister to clarify that point.</p><p>We must deal not only with illegal but with legal moneylenders.

I am also glad that interested parties' concerns about the bill have been resolved, which has cleared the way for unanimous support for the bill at stage 1.</p><p>I further welcome the commitment that was made by the Executive to amend the bill at stage 2 so that it will apply the provisions retrospectively and thus end the uncertainty that sufferers experience. I hope that the Executive's consultation of the Court of Session, the insurance industry and solicitors on the possibility of victims proceeding with one court action rather than two, as Mike Pringle mentioned, will be fruitful. Pursuit of a single action would be in the best interests of all parties and would lead to a more expedient and less harrowing process.</p><p>The Public Petitions Committee, of which I am a member, has dealt for several years with petitions on the issue from concerned groups. The evidence that we heard about victims' suffering was truly harrowing, as other members mentioned. I commend those groups on their contributions to the Public Petitions Committee as well as to the Justice 1 Committee. They contributed to the debate and highlighted the need for the bill. There is no doubt that the bill is welcomed by all members from all parties, for which we are grateful.</p><p>Although the provisions in the bill are welcomed by everyone, the bill will not put an end to the suffering. We must be ready to face other challenges, about which the Public Petitions Committee has received petitions. One of the great concerns that has been expressed by petitioners is about the need to provide adequate medication for people who suffer from this terrible disease. That is especially necessary when we consider the terrible death that is suffered by the victims.</p><p>At present, Alimta is the only drug that is available to treat the condition. It has been available in Scotland since July 2005, based on the advice of the Scottish Medicines Consortium. However, the drug is not freely available in England, where the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#8212;the United Kingdom-wide authority that has responsibility for licensing the drug&#8212;rejected its provision through the NHS. The drug is not part of the bill, so it is important that we consider it in that context. An appeal to NICE is currently in progress, but if that appeal fails&#8212;NICE has never overturned a ruling&#8212;there is, because <place-holder colnum=\"31764\"/> NICE guidance supersedes that of the SMC, a real danger that mesothelioma sufferers in Scotland will be denied the only treatment that is available to them. We all accept that we should consider that situation.</p><p>That concern was put to me by the same people who lobbied for the bill, not just through the Public Petitions Committee, but at meetings and through letters. Those people ask that we consider availability of Alimta as we consider the bill. Although I recognise that the problem does not relate directly to the bill, I urge the Executive to take this opportunity to allay sufferers' fear that the SMC's decision will not be upheld in the event that NICE rejects the provision of Alimta for the treatment of mesothelioma. Many sufferers have voiced concern that enactment of the bill will make it easier to withdraw free provision of the drug&#8212;which has been free since 2005&#8212;because sufferers will be considered to be able to pay for the treatment out of their own pockets, which would avoid the need for free provision on prescription.

Perhaps other schools could follow the lead of Whitehill secondary school and open at certain times.</p><p>Paul Martin talked about subsidising the police, but even the Scottish Police Federation has said that that is not the way to go. People in Govanhill pay rent to Glasgow Housing Association and extra moneys for two police officers at weekends.</p><p>The problem is a national problem rather than a problem for one area. We should not ask people who pay the same taxes that everyone else pays to pay extra money for extra police. The view of people in Govanhill and everybody else I speak to is that we need a properly funded police force and bobbies on the beat. I live in a city centre and I assure members that there is a lot of antisocial behaviour there. I doubt that a dispersal order would work in that city centre. Seeing extra police on the beat works. People do not commit crimes when police walk around on the beat.</p><p>As Paul Martin said, locals have welcomed the dispersal order, but locals also always say, as websites and newspaper cuttings do, that police on the beat are needed and that trouble is stopped when police are seen on the beat. Locals mention dispersal orders, but they constantly talk about having more police on the beat, which is the answer. There should be more local police whom people look up to, respect and are not afraid of. That is the way forward.

It is harmful to women, it is harmful to children and it is harmful to communities. Although I appreciate that this is a large and complex issue, I am disappointed by the narrow scope of the proposed legislation. I hope that it will be the first step in the right direction towards achieving the objectives that were identified by the expert group on prostitution. I remind members that the expert group had four objectives and that the bill's aim is just one of them. I hope that further legislation will be introduced to achieve the other three objectives, which have not yet been addressed.</p><p>I welcome the Executive's commitment to amend the bill in response to the concerns that <place-holder colnum=\"31157\"/> have been expressed not just by the Local Government and Transport Committee, but by the various agencies that have given evidence to the committee. I thank the committee for its scrutiny of the bill, and I thank the many people who contributed evidence towards that. I was a member of the Local Government Committee when Margo MacDonald's bill was introduced, and I agreed with some&#8212;but not all&#8212;of what she and others had to say. I am therefore pleased that the issue has returned to the committee and I look forward to debating the Executive's bill at stage 2.</p><p>I commend the Executive for agreeing to make robust and serious amendments to the bill, and I welcome the commitment to use the bill to target the other areas that I have mentioned&#8212;the other three objectives that were identified by the expert group. One of the good features of the proposed legislation is the criminalisation of the buyer. That is a sensible provision, and I welcome that aspect of the bill.</p><p>I turn to the area in Glasgow that other members have mentioned&#8212;I am sure that more members will mention it. Of the women whom we know to be involved in street prostitution in Glasgow, 95 per cent are drug users and have other very serious issues that need to be addressed. Unlike the buyers, those people do not have a choice; in many cases, prostitution is the only way they can survive. It is a sad state of affairs that exposes one of the failings of the bill, in that it does not back up action to help and support those very vulnerable women. The Executive should have focused on the need to promote ways out of the terrible trap, rather than introducing legislation that could, in some cases, make things more dangerous for the women involved.</p><p>Glasgow saw the effects of that approach when prostitution was forced out of the city centre and Glasgow Green, when residential areas were sprouting up around the harbour and waterfront in a way that is similar to what happened in the Leith area. At the time, many prostitutes simply moved to the Calton area, and we have heard evidence about how communities had to deal with that. The witnesses from that area who spoke to the committee demonstrated the terrible effect that prostitution had on their community, and it is terrible that people have to put up with it. I am reminded of one of the people from the Leith area who gave evidence about that area being designated as a tolerance zone. A woman who was walking to her house one night was knocked down by a car because she would not turn round to speak to the man in the car. Her leg was broken and he just drove away. Because the area was marked as a tolerance zone, he assumed that anyone&#8212;young women as well as older people&#8212;walking there would be fair game. That cannot be tolerated.<place-holder colnum=\"31158\"/></p><p>When we consider the legislation, we have to be careful not to repeat some of the mistakes that have been made in Edinburgh and thereby drive prostitution further underground. Prostitution is not as it was shown in the movie \"Pretty Woman\". That should be made very clear to some in the media who discuss the issues around prostitution.</p><p>I do not believe that Margo MacDonald's tolerance or management zones&#8212;call them what we will&#8212;are the answer. We need to enable women to escape from a never-ending cycle of violence, and tolerance or management zones are not the answer.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13376269", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prostitution (Public Places) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the fact that the issue of prostitution is being addressed.

I joined the committee a year and a half ago, which was about six months after it started its inquiry. However, I am able to say that the hard work that was done by members from all parties does credit to the Parliament's committee system. I pay tribute to the people from various <place-holder colnum=\"30555\"/> organisations who we heard from as the committee travelled round the country; they told us a lot about the experiences of disabled people. Sometimes we take it for granted that we can access leisure facilities, education, work and transport, but some of the people whom we met found it difficult to do so.</p><p>As the title of the report suggests, many of the difficulties that are faced by disabled people relate to access to leisure facilities, education and work. We looked at the issue in considerable detail. It was heartening to see that some of the problems are being recognised and that action is being taken on them in various areas. However, many people expressed their great disappointment about the fact that, although the solutions had been recognised, too little had been done to rectify the situation. That feeling echoes the research that the Executive undertook this year, which set out that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"despite solutions being known, a clear problem still remains\"</p><p>and that many recommendations that have been made</p><p class=\"indent\">\"continue not to be implemented.\"</p><p>I hope that the report acts as a catalyst to bring together all the previous and current research that we looked at, and that it will make a difference.</p><p>As I said, one of the main issues was access to services. That is particularly true in the case of transport, on which I will concentrate in my speech. As we heard, each committee member took on an area; mine was transport. As our report identifies, transport is one of the most important cross-cutting issues; it has great influence on many of the other areas that the report addresses.</p><p>If people are unable, or feel that they are unable, to get from A to B, it does not matter if B is accessible to them if they cannot get back to A. That situation was raised many times in our evidence taking. People asked the question: what is the point of making places accessible if disabled people experience barriers to accessing them? In such situations, much of the work that has been done on accessibility is wasted.</p><p>We took evidence from the providers of leisure facilities who are increasingly aware of the need to cater for disabled people. Obviously, people want to belong to society and to participate in leisure activities. In our evidence taking, it became clear that some people found it very difficult to access leisure facilities. They told us that that had a big effect on their lives. We have to look at the accessibility not only of leisure facilities&#8212;other committee members will address that&#8212;but of transport to and from those facilities.<place-holder colnum=\"30556\"/></p><p>The report highlights that point and identifies the fact that, in this and other areas, a joined-up approach is needed. As we said, it is not good enough for us to concentrate on one thing or to change one thing; we need to look at the big picture. The two previous speakers mentioned that, too. A key recommendation on transport is that the Scottish Executive should develop a Scotland-wide strategy for achieving equality of mobility for disabled people. The committee believes that the work that is being done on the national transport strategy offers an ideal opportunity in that regard. I am heartened by what the minister said.</p><p>The report identifies a lack of regular, reliable, fully accessible public transport and the need for staff to be trained in identifying the needs of disabled passengers. In addition, we need to address the misuse of disabled parking bays. If able-bodied people abuse that provision, it is not helpful to disabled people.</p><p>Having a reliable public transport system is fundamental if disabled people are to feel confident that they can go out and about. If someone has been immobile for some time but finally gets out and about only to find that public transport does not work for them, the progress that they have made will suffer a setback.</p><p>The committee was given a simple example of that, which concerned a transport provider using a mix of accessible and inaccessible buses on a bus route. Disabled people could go somewhere on the route using an accessible bus, only to find that they could not make the return journey because another bus on the route was not accessible. That example demonstrates how much need there is for joined-up thinking. Able-bodied people naturally assume that, if we can get on to a bus to go somewhere, we can also get home again. Unfortunately, disabled people have to plan their journeys carefully. That should not be the case nowadays; people should be able to access transport as and when they wish to do so.</p><p>As we heard, the committee recommended that the Executive should ensure that transport providers offer effective pre-journey information in which the accessibility levels of their services are made clear. Providers should ensure that they produce their information in all formats. In that regard, the committee heard a particularly crude example of how transport providers should not communicate with disabled people. The person in question, who was carrying a white cane, asked whether they were on the right bus only to be told by the driver that they should read the timetable. That illustrates the need for staff to have disability training. The evidence suggests that such things happen because staff are not made sufficiently aware of the issues. The committee recommends <place-holder colnum=\"30557\"/> that all staff should attend disability equality training. The minister mentioned that training.</p><p>The committee welcomes the fact that the Scottish Executive has given a commitment to improve train stations and to make them accessible to disabled passengers. However, I would like the Executive to set targets to make all our railways accessible within a given timescale. The Executive could look at that in greater detail.</p><p>One major issue to emerge from the inquiry is demand-responsive transport. Although DRT is not so much of an issue in our big cities, many people to whom we spoke in the rural areas believed that they could get about if only they were given access to a door-to-door bus or taxi service. Witnesses pointed out that the reduced availability of the transport that has traditionally been made available to take people to hospital appointments and so forth makes DRT increasingly important.</p><p>The Presiding Officer is indicating that I must wind up. In conclusion, I am heartened by the fact that many of the problems and potential solutions have been identified, although I am also slightly wary as a result of that&#8212;it makes the job easier in one way, but more difficult in another. We must look closely at the recommendations in the report and ensure that they are implemented. That must not be done in a piecemeal fashion.</p><p>We must remember that the problems exist and that they do not exist in isolation. We must take a joined-up approach. There is a golden opportunity to ensure that everyone&#8212;without discrimination&#8212;can become involved in and participate in society. I sincerely hope that the Executive will take on board the recommendations that the committee has made.</p>", "hdate": "2006-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13374914", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Removing Barriers and Creating Opportunities"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, offer my condolences and deep sympathies to Cathy Peattie.

It is incumbent on us all to do our utmost to end child poverty. It does not matter whether it is called relative, absolute or persistent poverty&#8212;it is poverty. It is unacceptable in the 21<sup>st</sup> century that one in four children in Scotland is living in such conditions and is disadvantaged through poverty. We cannot imagine just how difficult it is for them. Other members will have met, as I have, constituents who have no form of heating in their homes, who cannot clothe their children and who are dependent on benefits or are on low wages.</p><p>Tackling child poverty is a Westminster issue, but we have to force Westminster into doing something. I do not want to be political because we are talking about poverty, but for me the one <place-holder colnum=\"29804\"/> way to get people in Scotland out of poverty is to have an independent Scotland. I will perhaps touch on that later.</p><p>Jackie Baillie's motion says that 100,000 children have been lifted out of poverty by certain policies&#8212;I acknowledge that. Equally, however, motion S2M-5198 that was lodged by Karen Whitefield mentions that 100,000 Scottish children now live in fuel poverty simply because of the rise in energy prices. Therein lies our dilemma. We can propose policies&#8212;Jackie Baillie mentioned various policies that the Executive could adopt and said that we should have a joint working party with Westminster&#8212;but we have a dilemma. Low pay, child benefit and other benefits, energy prices, debt and the so on are all the responsibility of Westminster. We do not have control over them.</p><p>I fully support Save the Children's campaign, Barnardo's and all the other organisations. I particularly support Save the Children's campaign for seasonal grants and I wish it every success. I condemn Scottish Power's obscene profits, which are up by 77 per cent to &#163;483 million. We have the added concern of the Spanish takeover&#8212;we do not know what will happen.</p><p>Barnardo's says in its briefing that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Both Westminster and Holyrood policies contribute to poverty reduction. It is reserved matters&#8212;Treasury and Social Security&#8212;that have greatest potential to impact on poverty.\"</p><p>Jackie Baillie said that Gordon Brown, the chancellor, is considering winter fuel payments for the poorest families, and other matters that are reserved to Westminster. That is good&#8212;something may come out of that. However, the people whom I speak to want decent jobs, access to decent houses and access to decent education. They do not want handouts, but we constantly tell people that they must take handouts. When people take a low-paid job, their low pay is backed by the child tax credit. If winter fuel payments are offered, they will have to apply for them. All those payments are handouts. In an independent Scotland, people would not need to rely on that.</p><p>Jackie Baillie mentioned power companies' profits. Gordon Brown and successive Westminster Governments have had the power that she described for years but have done nothing with it. I support Jackie Baillie in asking Gordon Brown to do something, but the basic problem lies in our own country in that we do not, unfortunately, have the necessary powers. It is sad to say that, but until we have control over our own moneys and until we have our own benefits system, we will have poor people and children living in poverty. I do not want that to continue, which is why I believe that independence is the best way forward.

Amendment 131 is on land that the authority owns or has interest in. That is perceived by communities to be one of the most contentious issues, because they can see a complete conflict of interests with local authorities. Although local authorities may engage with communities, they have the right to go against their wishes, which can be a contentious issue with communities and the public at large. Amendment 132 is on strategic and local development plans, which are another highly contentious issue; I am sure that members' postbags must be full of issues raised by the communities that they represent throughout Scotland. Communities are asked to take part, sometimes for many years, in local development plans, only to discover at the end of the consultation process&#8212;we have seen this with hospital consultations, too&#8212;that a development is pushed upon them against their wishes. That cannot be right.</p><p>I remind members that my amendments are for a limited third-party right of appeal.

It cannot be fair that communities do not have the right of appeal. Authorities can consult to death if they wish to do so, but there must be an end point, and communities do not have that end point. The third-party right of appeal is not anti-development, nor is it against economic <place-holder colnum=\"29324\"/> growth. The third-party right of appeal would enhance the planning process and ensure that communities were brought in, not just at the beginning of the process but at the very end.

I am pleased that the debate is being conducted under the heading \"Violence Against Women\" and not under the heading of domestic violence. Regardless of who the violence is against, it is a crime. For far too long, because it was perpetrated by men against women, domestic violence has been looked on as a form of second-class violence. I have always had the notion&#8212;the absolutely correct notion&#8212;that violence of any kind is a crime and should be treated as such. We <place-holder colnum=\"29144\"/> must not look on violence against women as anything less than that.</p><p>I admire the commitment that the Deputy Minister for Communities and the Minister for Communities give to the issue and to the sincerity of that commitment. I share Carolyn Leckie's view of the minister. She did not say that he is her favourite minister, but mentioned his sincerity. Johann Lamont is also sincere in her commitment; I know that for a fact. Both ministers are passionate about the subject.</p><p>I applaud Carolyn Leckie and Cathie Craigie on their contributions; they were spot on. I have never understood why someone's past relationships or what they wear should be used to tarnish their reputation, particularly when the attacker is set free as a result. Rosemary Byrne referred to the tragic case of Lindsay Armstrong. Some weeks ago, I met Mrs Armstrong. Not all members may agree with the proposal, but consideration should be given to changing court procedures.</p><p>The debate has been excellent and every speech merits a response. I will attempt to pick up on all of them, but members will forgive me if I do not manage that. We have debated the subject of violence against women since 1999, at which time the debate was billed domestic abuse. Since 2003, the Parliament has held an annual debate on the issue. I welcome that. I also welcome the many projects that aim to stop this terrible crime that have been launched and the money that the Executive has made available.</p><p>As Christine Grahame said, violence against women has increased over the years. We have to ask why. Cathy Peattie and Nora Radcliffe, among others, touched on possible answers, including the fact that women are more aware of what is happening and where they can report the crime. Another possibility is the upsurge in lad mags, lap-dancing clubs and the accessibility of some forms of pornography. We need to look more deeply into why violence against women is not diminishing but increasing. The figures speak for themselves.</p><p>Many members, including Shiona Baird and Rosemary Byrne, talked about funding. I agree with their comments. The SNP amendment mentions funding for refuge places. Some women are lucky enough to have relatives they can stay with, as Bill Aitken said when he talked about refuge places in Glasgow, but many women do not. There should be refuge places for such women and funding is crucial if we are to help them.</p><p>I remind the minister that Ranald Lindsay, who is the convener of the Law Society of Scotland's access to justice committee, has talked about the emergence of legal aid deserts. As a result of a change in how civil legal aid is paid, many victims <place-holder colnum=\"29145\"/> are unable to access lawyers to take on their case. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our consciences are basically being exploited by the Executive on this. They know that it's difficult for us to turn away Mrs Jones who's been battered black and blue, saying that we're not being paid enough.\"</p><p>The minister should consider the problem of people's inability to secure representation, which happens not just in Glasgow, but in Edinburgh, Stirling and elsewhere.</p><p>Other members talked about the lack of long-term funding, which causes serious difficulties for people who are trying to do their best in organisations that cannot access funding that lasts longer than two years. I received a letter from the Glasgow presbytery, which is part of the interagency working group that is funded by the Executive and Glasgow City Council. The initiative provides a fantastic support network for women before, during and after court cases, but it has to submit a bid for funding every two years.</p><p>Many other groups are in a similar situation and do not know whether they will be funded in two years' time. That is unsettling. I have written to the minister to ask him to consider how such groups can secure long-term funding. In his speech, he said that money is available, but it does not seem to filter down to the many agencies that need it. Perhaps he can consider how they might access funding.</p><p>Cathy Peattie and Shiona Baird made valid points about the international situation. They referred to Afghanistan and other countries. It is imperative that we do not take an insular view of violence against women by talking only about domestic violence or violence that takes place in Scotland and Great Britain. The problem is international. Trafficking of women and abuse of children is taking place abroad, for example in Russia and its neighbouring states. We should consider how to alleviate the problem. If we cannot provide money, as Shiona Baird suggested, we can surely contribute by highlighting the problem. Operation pentameter tackled trafficking and was a great success. We need more such forward-looking action to prevent women from being trafficked to this country, as well as action to protect women from violence in their home countries.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson and other members, including Shiona Baird, made important points about violence that takes place behind closed doors, which has a seriously detrimental effect on children. As Rosemary Byrne said, we do not know what is going on in the lives of children who come to school. I have no doubt that exposure to violence at a young age sends a message to kids that it is okay to be violent. There are education programmes, but we must improve education for <place-holder colnum=\"29146\"/> children so that we send a clear message that violence is not acceptable. If we emphasise that message to male schoolchildren, perhaps it will filter through.</p><p>As everyone else has said, this has been a good debate. I hope that we will not have to debate violence against women next year, because that will mean that it has been eradicated. However, like others, I think that it will be a long time before that happens. As far as I know, this is the only Parliament that has raised these issues year after year since 2003 to keep them on the agenda and which funds projects such as Scottish Women's Aid to deal with the problem specifically. I hope that the funding goes from strength to strength and is made more long term.</p><p>Every one of us here hopes to eradicate violence against women, which is a crime against humanity, not just against women. I look forward to the day when we do not have to debate it, because it has been eradicated.

Second-stage transfer is supposed to be completed in 2007, but we are not even near it yet. I will ask the minister a couple of questions, and perhaps whoever sums up will be able to answer them. Has the minister sought independent, external advice on the financial shortfall for second-stage transfer, which the GHA's own financial report said was &#163;500 million? If it has not, the second-stage transfer will not go ahead. The minister said that 2006 would be a pivotal year for second-stage transfer. Does she still believe that? We are nearing the end of 2006, and nothing has happened. When will we see second-stage transfer in Glasgow?</p><p>The minister cannot hide from the issue&#8212;neither can anyone in the Labour Party. For years, they have been talking about second-stage transfer. The process started in 2003, and we are nearly in 2007.

I will not rename the debate, but perhaps we can think about that in the future.</p><p>I also thank the minister for attending and responding to the debate. We seldom get a minister for such debates, and I am pleased that he is here. I take on board what he said about devolution, but how can Scotland be international if it is not independent? From my introduction, members will sense that I will talk about independence, which is closely linked with internationalism.</p><p>Tomorrow morning, Parliament is going to be lobbied by people who are against dawn raids and the destitution faced by asylum seekers in <place-holder colnum=\"28472\"/> Scotland. If Scotland were truly international, would we be dragging people out of their homes at 6 o'clock in the morning, in some cases handcuffing them, taking away their medicines, and terrifying their children and locking them up in Dungavel detention centre? That would not happen in an independent international Scotland. We would have our own immigration and asylum legislation. The First Minister would not be sitting waiting for instructions from Westminster under his much-vaunted protocol, because we would have our own protocol. That is what I call true internationalism.</p><p>Would an international Scotland have taken part in an illegal war in Iraq? I do not think so. Would we be following America blindly and be her wagging tail? I do not think so. An independent Scotland could have played a role in the international community and been a voice of reason and justice against the scaremongering and warmongering that was perpetrated by Bush and Blair.</p><p>Would Scotland, as an international country, have allowed her airports to be used by rendition flights taking people to other countries to be tortured? Would we have allowed our airports to be used to refuel planes that were carrying to Lebanon the cluster bombs that killed a young child as recently as Monday? I think not. An international Scotland would not have put up with that at all.</p><p>I returned from Lebanon on Sunday. The warmth expressed to us there was absolutely overwhelming. Wherever we went, no matter whether we were speaking to the media, meeting people in the streets or speaking to Government officials, we were referred to and introduced as a Scottish delegation.</p><p>To pick up on Des McNulty's point about identity, he said that we are how we are seen in the world and we should not be antagonistic. It might not be the case in a British context, but in a Scottish context we are seen as being against antagonism. I am proud to have visited Lebanon as part of a Scottish delegation. We need to play to our Scottish identity. Scottish people are welcomed throughout the world regardless of what happens on the international stage. If we were truly independent, we could go forward on the international stage. I am sorry that Des McNulty is no longer present in the chamber, but we have nothing to be ashamed of in saying that we have an identity. We may all be internationalists, but until we put forward the case for an independent Scotland, we will not be able to be so in the international arena.</p><p>I am reminded of the debate that I saw on Monday between&#8212;I am sorry to take people's names in vain when they are not in the chamber&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"28473\"/> Jim Mather and Wendy Alexander. In the debate, which took place in a television studio, we were told by the interviewer that an independent Scotland would have no say anywhere as it would be outwith any international community. Why is it assumed that if Scotland became independent, England would take over all the powers of Great Britain? Is it not the case that England also would need to renegotiate as an international body within the international community? We should bear that in mind.</p><p>Scotland has always had a reputation as an international, outward-looking country. One reason why I have always harboured a desire for an independent Scotland is that we could do things internationally and help other people. We could promote our Scottish values, which are very much valued throughout the world, to other countries, without being part of a British state that simply props up America. Scotland could promote its values very well.</p><p>As I mentioned, when I was in Lebanon I saw some horrific sights, but I also met some very interesting and fantastic people. The resilience of the Lebanese people was overwhelming. Within 24 hours, people returned to bombed-out houses, looked into the abyss that had once been their house and scrabbled in the rubble for school books and family pictures. They were resilient because they want to have their own country. They want the freedom to make their own decisions without the interference of America, Israel and, to a certain extent, Britain.</p><p>I was honoured to visit Lebanon&#8212;I thank all those who organised our visit and took us to meet so many people&#8212;but I was ashamed when I saw the destruction that had taken place. It has now been proven that the plane that refuelled at Prestwick airport had cluster bombs, which are the bombs that killed that young boy on Monday afternoon. I am ashamed of that, but I was glad that I could say that an independent Scotland, as part of the international community, would have taken no part in that whatsoever.</p><p>I saw the excessive destruction that Israel caused in Lebanon, the economy of which is in tatters. Israel blew up bridges so that the north of Lebanon could not get supplies through to any part of the south. Cluster bombs were dropped on the banana plantations and olive groves from which the Lebanese make their money. An oil refinery was blown up, so two thirds of the beaches are now covered in oil and are unusable&#8212;although they are being cleaned up with help, I might add, from the European Union.</p><p>Women and children were killed. A particularly poignant incident occurred in Cana, which has suffered greatly over the past 20 years. A nine-month-old baby and all the members of its family <place-holder colnum=\"28474\"/> were massacred by Israeli bombs. However, we heard not one word from our so-called Prime Minister Blair about the need for an immediate ceasefire or about the excessive force that Israel used. I find it insulting to be part of a so-called British community whose Government has issued not one word of apology to the people of Lebanon and the children of Cana.</p><p>Scotland has always had an international outlook, but until we achieve independence we cannot get it on the international stage.</p>", "hdate": "2006-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13368988", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland International"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the independents group for choosing today's debate&#8212;Scotland international&#8212;although I am tempted to rename it Scotland international plc, which has a nice ring to it.

One of the first debates in the Parliament was on the subject of crossrail. There has been a feasibility study, for which I did some research. Nothing has changed. We desperately need crossrail. We have been dragging our heels over it for 30 years. I thank Alistair Watson, SPT and all the other so-called amateurs who provided us with information on crossrail. Crossrail is desperately needed, not just by Glasgow but, as Bill Butler said so eloquently, by the whole conurbation. Crossrail has been years in the waiting and everyone knows the facts.</p><p>In 2002, an excellent demand study was completed. It said that we should go ahead and have crossrail. Then a central Scotland transport corridor study was done in 2003 and a technical feasibility study in 2005. In fact, crossrail has been studied so much that it is a wonder that it has not been studied completely out of the Parliament. However, Bill Butler and others in the cross-party group on Glasgow crossrail have been pushing hard to ensure that the Executive realises that the project must be completed.</p><p>The technical feasibility study must be adhered to. The crossrail project has the potential to accommodate services that could radiate not only throughout Glasgow and its conurbation but throughout Scotland. We must remember that not only Glasgow, but the whole of Scotland, would benefit from crossrail.</p><p>The technical feasibility study, which I think is an Executive paper, says that crossrail can be delivered by 2011-12. If we are talking about the Commonwealth games coming to Glasgow in 2014, we must get crossrail on the drawing board as quickly as possible. In fact, we should really have it on the drawing board now to ensure that it is ready for the 2014 Commonwealth games.</p><p>I mentioned that the crossrail project has been a long time in coming, even to reach the Parliament and go through various committees, but I must also mention that it fulfils all the criteria to help the city to expand and reach its full social and economic potential. Crossrail would connect the rail network and subway north and south of the Clyde. The low-level station at Queen Street would also become more useful with crossrail, which would also provide increased integration with the subway system at the West Street station.</p><p>The crossrail system would support social inclusion projects, because areas such as the Gorbals and Oatlands would benefit from being <place-holder colnum=\"27946\"/> able to link into it. That must be good for the economy of Glasgow and the conurbation, but one of the most telling aspects of the scheme is that some of the areas that the system would connect have low car use. If the crossrail connection existed, the people there would be able to access the city centre and other areas. That would mean that they would not be so socially excluded and we would not need to use cars as much.</p><p>In March, I wrote to Malcolm Reed, who was the director general of SPT and is now the chief executive of Transport Scotland, and pled with him to ensure that the crossrail scheme was included in the strategic planning review. I finished my letter by saying that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it would be organisational neglect\"</p><p>if the crossrail was not put on the cards as quickly as possible. I repeat that to him and the minister. If we do not go ahead with crossrail, not only Glasgow but other places will suffer.

However, anyone who is in an emergency will go to the nearest hospital, which, for people in the area that we are discussing, is Glasgow royal infirmary. They will <place-holder colnum=\"27487\"/> not be guided by lectures from the health board. One of my worries about the proposal with regard to Monklands is the impact that that will have on Glasgow and other areas. We must have a real debate on this issue so that we may re-examine the decisions that have been taken and&#8212;I hope&#8212;overturn them.</p><p>I said that Glasgow was downgrading to a position in which it will have only two full A and E units. It is also downgrading Victoria and Stobhill as well. That will take place in 2009. The redevelopment of Glasgow royal infirmary is not anticipated to take place until 2013. The decisions that are being made will put even more strain on our services in Glasgow and the wider area. The GRI is currently operating at 80 per cent of its capacity and Victoria and Stobhill will also have to cope with an influx of patients if Monklands closes down. Currently, Victoria deals with more cases than the GRI does, and Monklands deals with about the same amount of cases as the GRI. It does not take an expert to work out that a disaster is about to happen. I pointed that out to the minister in a question that I put to him on 4 May this year. Before Monklands hospital was opened, the GRI was running at 150 per cent of its capacity. We cannot possibly go back to that situation.</p><p>The \"Delivering for Health\" document, which has been mentioned, is all very well, but Glasgow royal infirmary cannot cope with the extra influx. I am not scaremongering when I say that lives will be put at risk if something is not done about the situation.</p><p>I find it incomprehensible that one of the most major impacts of the downgrading of Monklands&#8212;the effect that that will have on surrounding areas&#8212;was not mentioned until a week before the consultation closed. That makes me wonder whether there is a legal ground for challenging the health board's decision.</p><p>The minister has to consider the situation seriously. The views of the Scottish health council and the bodies that I would call quangos that this Government has set up are being taken into account. However, surely the public should have the final say. They are the ones who will suffer as a result of a bad decision being made.</p><p>The figures for the money that was spent by the health board on the hospitals&#8212;&#163;56 a head at Monklands, &#163;70 at Wishaw and &#163;72 at Hairmyres&#8212;show that Monklands was the cheapest to run. Why, then, was a decision taken to close it down?</p><p>I ask the minister to address, in his summing up, the issue of the admissibility, or inadmissibility, of the consultation, given the fact that the major issue of the impact that the downgrading of <place-holder colnum=\"27488\"/> Monklands would have on the rest of Scotland was not mentioned until a week before the end of the consultation.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13366607", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No; I was not allowed to intervene earlier.

I agree with what Pauline McNeill said about the successful campaign that was run by the <em>Evening Times</em> &#8212;I congratulate the paper on its campaign. We talk about accountability, and the <em>Evening Times</em> certainly brought some of the bus companies to account and ensured that the public, at last, got some reaction from them. I look forward to seeing what the Competition Commission has to say about the comments that the public made during that campaign.</p><p>I know that the minister has been sent a letter by a constituent of mine regarding the service&#8212;or, rather, the non-service&#8212;that he received. The motion talks about poor services after hours; Rob Gibson talked about the problem in his area. Similarly, in some areas of Glasgow, there is no service whatever after 6 o'clock, which means that people are stranded and are unable to visit relatives. More important is that people can get a bus to Gartnavel hospital, but cannot get a bus back. Elderly people who go to the hospital to visit relatives have to get taxis back. That is ridiculous, given the subsidies that bus companies receive from the Executive. I would like that to be investigated by the Competition Commission.</p><p>Last year, FirstBus made &#163;100 million profit, but what has it done? It has withdrawn services from various areas, including low-level bus services, which are useful to infirm, disabled and elderly people and to people with prams. Limited as those services might have been, some people cannot access them any more. I wrote to the minister on the subject and have received a reply, which mentions that powers relating to such services are reserved to Westminster. That is an absolute nonsense, which we should also consider.</p><p>On greater accountability, I will read out part of a letter that a constituent of mine&#8212;Mr McGrath&#8212;wrote to the minister. This elderly gentleman, who was using a concession ticket, had to wait a number of hours to get on a bus because the <place-holder colnum=\"27232\"/> operator told him and the other concession ticket holders who wanted to get on the bus that only people with valid tickets could get on the bus. He wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I was never so badly treated, or made to feel so demeaned in front of people in all my life by this policy of Control by the bus companies. I assume the Scottish Executive would not accept this is what should happen to Old and Disabled people?\"</p><p>At the same time as bus companies are failing to provide an adequate service, they are also discriminating against people who are using their concessionary tickets, in respect of which we pay the bus companies a lot of money.</p><p>There needs to be a review of exactly what is happening with the bus companies. The review can examine the London model or another form of franchise, but there needs to be a review that gets people round the table.

I was at the meeting with Robina Qureshi to which he referred in the St Francis Centre in the Gorbals. There were some raised eyebrows when Jamie McGrigor was introduced as a Tory MSP, but his sentiments went down well. I am sure that he is most sincere, particularly on the issue of children. I thank other members for their speeches, too.</p><p>I completely abhor any form of racial discrimination or violence. I am proud to be a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee. As Jamie McGrigor and Linda Fabiani pointed out, more people are assaulted in this country just because of the colour of their skin and while they are walking about the streets than all the other people who are assaulted. If we wish to go down the road of mentioning particular nationalities, we should also mention Muslims, Jews, Scots and Sikhs. Donald Gorrie summed up the matter when he said that it is ignorance that makes people do that. It is not inherent in the Scottish race that we are violent people who attack others simply because they have a strange accent or a different colour of skin. Jamie McGrigor mentioned some measures that Highland Council has taken to welcome people into the area. We should celebrate some of the positive attitudes in Scotland and the measures that we have taken to welcome people here. I include refugees, whom I find to be a fantastic bunch of people who love <place-holder colnum=\"26975\"/> Scotland, particularly the Glaswegians. Glasgow is not known as the friendly city for nothing. I will speak about that more in a moment.</p><p>I turn to the motion on race equality in the name of Malcolm Chisholm. I welcome much of what the minister said, including his comments on the development of a national strategy&#8212;I look forward to its publication. I also welcome the race equality, integration and community support fund. Malcolm Chisholm mentioned a sum of &#163;2 million. I welcome the fact that the fund is targeted locally and designed to support cross-community integration, which is important for communities. Jamie McGrigor mentioned that we want to act not from the top down but from the bottom up, which is what targeted community initiatives help to do. Such initiatives help not only to bring people and communities together but to tackle racism and promote equality. That fund is to be applauded.</p><p>The Scottish refugee integration fund is also most welcome. It has been strengthening support for refugees, asylum seekers and communities since, I believe, 2003&#8212;I am sure that someone will correct me if that is not right. The fund supports more and more projects&#8212;21 projects now benefit from it, which is to be admired. I give the minister credit for the expansion of that fund, but we need to examine the funding and expand it even more.</p><p>Linda Fabiani mentioned data collection, with which some people are not happy. I would like improved collection of data on racial inequalities in the labour market. The minister said that a group was to be set up on the labour market. I want to know whether it will consider data collection issues, by which I mean not just collecting data in Scotland, but saying exactly what the data mean and monitoring and totalling them. That is something that is lacking. I have asked questions on that issue previously. We need data to know exactly what is happening in our society, particularly in relation to inequalities and racial issues in the labour market.</p><p>Dave Petrie and, I think, Nora Radcliffe compared the percentage of people from ethnic minorities who are employed to the percentage of people from other racial groups who are employed. We need to pay attention to that, but we need the appropriate data to do so. Businesses also need to understand the benefits and advantages of racial equality in the workplace. If we had the data available, we could provide information to businesses to encourage them to employ more people of different ethnicities, which is important. I ask the minister whether the group that he mentioned will consider data collection issues.</p><p>Many members have mentioned education, which is important, not only for people from ethnic <place-holder colnum=\"26976\"/> minorities but for others who live in our country. We need greater involvement in schools by ethnic minority parents, but we must encourage them to get involved. I know what it was like when I ran a play scheme. Trying to involve people who came from two streets away was difficult. Those people were not from ethnic minorities; they were people who lived in the area. If it was difficult for parents to make that one step, it is even more difficult for people from an ethnic minority background to do so. Schools and parents must encourage ethnic minority parents to have greater involvement in schools. We can work together on that.</p><p>Cathy Peattie, Nora Radcliffe, Mark Ballard and others have mentioned Gypsy Travellers. As Cathy Peattie and Linda Fabiani said, the issue has been going on for years. Something must be done. We have heard some tragic stories. Young Gypsy Travellers have told us about the life that they led and what was expected of them&#8212;or what was not expected of them, which was the saddest part. They had confidence, but nothing was expected of them. We should consider that issue. I am glad that Maureen Watt, a list MSP for North East Scotland, mentioned Gypsy Travellers because it shows that representatives of the Aberdeen area are not frightened to raise the issue. The media must be told that it has a responsibility to society. As others have said, there has been some ridiculous newspaper coverage of Gypsy Travellers; for example, apparently rubbish was put in the middle of a roundabout and blamed on the Travellers, yet they did not even live there. That is terrible.</p><p>I cannot speak in the debate without mentioning an issue that has been mentioned in the SNP amendment and by other members, which is asylum seekers and immigration. I remind Bill Aitken that Catalonia, which is not yet independent, has control over immigration. We will see how it gets on. It has given leave for asylum seekers to remain in Barcelona, in particular. That benefits not just asylum seekers, who cannot now be used as cheap labour, but the economy too, because those people are now paying taxes and there are no underground, hidden workers. I congratulate countries such as Catalonia that have done that.</p><p>I am sure that the minister is aware of the issue that I am about to mention. I attended a meeting last night in Pollokshaws in Glasgow, where it was standing room only. It was about the new national asylum support service contracts in Glasgow, 20 per cent of which are going to be privatised. Some people in Pollokshaws have been there for five or six years, and have three, four or five children and no money whatever. Last night, I stayed behind to speak to various people. My surgery was full today, simply because NAAS has said that people must accept the accommodation that is offered to <place-holder colnum=\"26977\"/> them. If they do not accept the accommodation, their benefits will be taken away. They were offered a YMCA in Glasgow, which is a soft Dungavel, because people are not allowed visitors, they have to sign in and there are no washing machines. What frightened the asylum seekers even more is the possibility of having 300 asylum seekers in one high-rise tower block, where it would be easy for NAAS to come along and deport them. Some of those people have been living in communities in Pollokshaws for six years and their kids are integrated into the school. The issue of integration is mentioned in the motion. The communities into which those people and their kids are integrated will be destroyed by what is happening.</p><p>I praise Labour councillors Stephen Curran, from Pollokshaws, and Irene Graham, who sent out a letter and, through the media and through various meetings, such as the one that I attended yesterday, managed to get three months' grace for the asylum seekers. Some of the councillors at Glasgow City Council are doing good work to promote the cause of the asylum seekers. We now have three months to fight the issue and to ensure that those people stay in Pollokshaws.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13365452", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Race Equality"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Jamie McGrigor for his speech.

It will certainly bring benefits not only to workers in those areas&#8212;it is bound to bring more tourists. A person who has come off a plane at Glasgow airport and who has stayed at a hotel in Glasgow might stay the next night in Paisley, Ayrshire or Inverclyde. If the scheme is properly marketed, which we should consider, people will have options. We should be much more forward thinking and forward looking.

It will provide the people of Aberdeen and other places with a link to the airport link. At the moment, we do not have a link between Glasgow Central station and Glasgow Queen Street station, but we should not overlook the fact that there are plenty of tunnels underneath Glasgow. Most Glasgow people know about the tunnels underneath the city and about viaducts and so on that have not been considered&#8212;there are tunnels underneath the botanic gardens, for example&#8212;which can all be considered and linked up.

I attended a meeting that was hosted by Dennis Canavan this afternoon, at which it was mentioned that we need such transport links to ensure our that bid for the Commonwealth games in 2014 is watertight.

I have the petition with me and I will confine my remarks to the subject of the petition and to Adam Ingram's motion. The petition asks that deafblind people should receive a decent service. It does not just want services to be provided in the community; it wants there to be a unit for deafblind people, in particular for those with mental health problems.</p><p>When Drena O'Malley gave evidence to the Public Petitions Committee, some of the stories that she told were horrifying and heart-breaking. She told of deafblind people with mental health problems who had been taken to prison because there was no one in the police station or anywhere else who could tell exactly what had happened. Those people were put into prison or psychiatric hospitals, and some of them were never given an explanation of why they were there. Sometimes it was 24 hours or a couple of days before an interpreter could be found. I commend Drena O'Malley for all the times that she has responded when she was called out in the early hours of the morning because she was the only interpreter whom people could rely on. There is a great dearth of people who can help with the communication problems of this branch of the community in our country.</p><p>I cannot understand why the John Denmark unit, which has been providing services&#8212;they might not have been the best services, but at least something was being provided&#8212;is under threat of being taken away, with nothing to replace it. I know that the minister has mentioned to the health boards that access should be made easier, but as <place-holder colnum=\"26457\"/> Adam Ingram pointed out, access is subject to a postcode lottery&#8212;it depends on the health board area in which someone stays. We need to give these people a decent service. No other members of our community would put up with such totally inadequate psychiatric, mental health or health services. I appeal to the minister to take that on board. We are here to represent all our communities, but deafblind people, particularly those who have mental health problems, are being served the least well.</p><p>I remind members of the evidence that was given to the Public Petitions Committee. We heard about people who did not know what was happening suddenly being taken to a psychiatric hospital and not having a clue why they were there; there was no one there to interpret for them and to tell them that they could contact their family. I ask the minister to put himself in their shoes and imagine what that must be like. Stewart Stevenson highlighted the length of time that deafblind people, in comparison with other folk, spend in institutions. Please try to imagine what it must be like if access to services is not available.</p><p>Finally, I ask the minister to say tonight when we will get a replacement for the service that is currently provided by the John Denmark unit.

I commend the Finance Committee's call for a review of the national priorities action fund, the excellence fund and the antisocial behaviour programme. Those must be reviewed, as they were intended to benefit deprived areas but that aim does not appear to be reflected in the allocation to authorities with high levels of deprivation. That is a marvellous part of the committee's report, which I welcome. Des McNulty mentioned that the Executive is considering establishing a single deprivation fund. The Executive should establish such a fund. The minister said that he would look upon that favourably and I hope that he will do so. He has acknowledged that we need joined-up thinking. There is no point in spending money all over the place through various agencies if we do not have an outcome.

I hope that <place-holder colnum=\"26417\"/> the minister will acknowledge that fact. I take on board the point that Mike Rumbles and others have made that there are many forms of deprivation, but we cannot get away from the fact that Glasgow is the most deprived area in Scotland. Something must be done to tackle that. Once we tackle the deprivation in Glasgow, we can get the powerhouse working, which I am sure will have a ripple effect throughout the economy.</p><p>An evaluation must be done of the success of funding projects. People must be taken out of poverty, ill health and deprivation, so that they can make the contribution that they want to make to their country. Most important, the only way in which we will achieve that is through independence, not through looking at reports and through small agencies here and there. It has been proved that the treaty of union is an absolute disgrace. Three hundred years down the line, let us turn the position round and let the people of Scotland be proud to be Scottish.

I know that Donald Gorrie will also discuss the work that he has done to introduce legislation on sectarianism.</p><p>Bill Butler said that we should be honest. I agree that we have to be honest, as Bill Aitken was. We cannot shy away from the fact that, for years and years, Scotland&#8212;Glasgow in particular&#8212;has suffered sectarianism, violence and abuse, all because of two football teams. Things have certainly changed to an extent, but I have never for the life of me understood why the teams called Glasgow Celtic and Glasgow Rangers never seem to fly the saltire&#8212;although that is changing in some respects. We must challenge those football clubs on that. Like Bill Butler, I see a great deal of violence on Saturdays in the city centre. There is no point in hiding the fact.</p><p>The other weekend, we watched Heart of Midlothian v Gretna. The fans came out in their thousands and walked along to get their trains from and back to Glasgow Central. There was not one bit of trouble. The fans, including kids, were all joining in, singing and dancing in the streets. We must ask ourselves this: they are all football fans, so why is there such a big difference when it comes to the rivalry between two certain teams? Apparently, in Edinburgh, there is some form of bother to do with football clubs and religion, too. However, at rugby matches at Murrayfield, we never see any trouble.</p><p>The Executive's 18-point plan notwithstanding, we must look deeper into the problem and find out why, while some people can support football teams such as Partick Thistle without any bother at all, others cannot support teams such as Rangers and Celtic without coming to blows and engaging in violence. Offensive artefacts and <place-holder colnum=\"25960\"/> articles have been mentioned. Supposedly, their sale has now been stopped, and there was legislation to tackle that aspect of the problem, but it still goes on&#8212;I still see articles and artefacts being paraded about the streets of Glasgow and being sold quite openly outside certain football clubs. They are still there, albeit that they are now slightly underground. We should acknowledge that.</p><p>I welcome those representing the churches and other bodies who are in the public gallery. Helen Miller of Nil by Mouth has campaigned tirelessly to stop this problem happening, and Cara Henderson has also campaigned tirelessly for years.</p><p>As Bill Butler rightly said, it all comes down to education. We can do whatever we want, as long as we educate the kids. That is where the effort must come from. I have visited schools throughout Glasgow and have spoken to pupils from both sides of the divide. I have tried to understand why they have such a hatred for people who come from another area and support a different team.</p><p>Some of the kids are trying hard with the help of the 18-point plan and the &#163;100,000 that the Executive has allocated to help to stop sectarianism in schools for 2006. Initiatives to combat sectarianism must begin at school level. We must speak to the kids and stress that it is not the be-all and end-all. The same message must come from the football fans. Sectarianism does occur in other areas of life, but the majority of it relates to those two football clubs, which, financially, seem to gain a lot from the number of fans that they attract. I often wonder whether they would profit as much without the sectarian element. They must ask themselves that question too.</p><p>Are enough changes being made? Are fans speaking to each other? It has been said that the only way to stop domestic violence against women is to have men raise the matter with each other and say that it is not acceptable. The only way that we can target and bring an end to sectarianism is to educate the kids at school and get the football fans to talk to each other and point out those who are singing sectarian chants at football matches, which has happened. The Executive, MSPs and the whole of society must be involved in education, but football fans must say to each other that sectarianism is not acceptable.</p><p>I look forward to the day when I can bring visitors to Glasgow and walk about the streets without fear of their being abused verbally or physically just because they are wearing a particular football scarf or belong to a particular religion.</p><p>We cannot get away from the fact that the vast bulk of sectarianism in Scotland affects the west of <place-holder colnum=\"25961\"/> Scotland and Glasgow in particular. We must tackle that seriously. I welcome all the work that the Executive is doing and I am glad that the Minister for Justice and Deputy Minister for Justice are here. As Bill Butler said, there is no point in our not telling the truth. We must be up front and honest about the problem. The situation has changed slightly, but it has not changed enough.

I remind members of some of the report's recommendations, which were that high-quality services should be maintained locally; that local needs and expectations should be met; that options for change should be developed with people, not for them; and&#8212;this one is close to my heart&#8212;that the Scottish Executive should review its guidance on public consultation, with a view to promoting best practice.</p><p>A number of weeks ago, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde held a workshop about the new sick kids hospital, which I and others were not told about. However, being the type of person that I am, I found out about it and managed to go along. In light of my experience, perhaps the Executive should review its guidance on public consultation.</p><p>On the maintenance of local high-quality services, I point out that Glasgow has gone from having five accident and emergency departments to having only two. Given the threat to Monklands hospital, which I mentioned last week, and the state of the services in Argyll and Clyde, I have to ask what kind of local services we can expect in Glasgow. When people have to travel three quarters of the way around Glasgow and beyond to get to what should be local services, I do not think that local needs and expectations are being <place-holder colnum=\"25759\"/> met. How would having only two maternity hospitals in Glasgow meet local needs and expectations? It is proposed that the new site for maternity and sick kids' services should be at the Southern general hospital, but it is in dire need of modernisation. Operating theatres are closing down there because of modernisation. Maternity wards are being closed because they need refurbished and fixed&#8212;they are falling down. How can people be comfortable with that situation? I would like the minister to look into that particular issue.</p><p>Margo MacDonald and Eleanor Scott mentioned the training of staff. That is an important point. I recognise the fact that staff have to be trained to do outreach work. However, at the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde meeting that I referred to, certain fears were raised regarding specialised paediatric nurses. Obviously, if facilities are closing, parents will themselves diagnose their children, deciding whether to take them to the sick kids hospital across the river, an ambulatory care and diagnostic centre or local services&#8212;of course, we should bear in mind the fact that the ACADs and local services will not be open at night.</p><p>When I asked a question about the specialist training of paediatric nurses, I was told that that was being looked at. It is an important point and I would like the minister to tell us whether the Executive has any figures regarding the training of staff. Like Mary Mulligan, I think that the Kerr report's recommendations in that regard were important. We do not seem to have any monitoring or evaluation of any of those aspects of the Kerr report.</p><p>The Kerr report mentioned the fact that we have to look after people in deprived areas. However, I do not see any more outreach work being done in the deprived areas that I represent, such as Drumchapel. There is no evidence of extra nurses, doctors and health workers being able to do outreach work in those areas. I would like the minister to tell us whether there are any updated figures on outreach work or recommendations about how we can get the health professionals to work in the areas that I mentioned, so that people there get the services that they deserve.</p><p>The Kerr report says that services should be localised to meet people's needs. I do not believe that closing down three hospitals and having only two maternity hospitals is meeting people's local needs in Glasgow. I would like the minister to revisit that issue.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13362049", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Health Service (Future Needs)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like Eleanor Scott, I want to know what has happened since the Kerr report was published a year ago.

I will do my best, Presiding Officer, although I hope that I will not lose any time because of the interruption.</p><p>The National Assembly for Wales launched a strategy on aging in 2003, and I have always said to the minister and others that Scotland should have a strategy. I am glad that we are now to have one. The strategy in Wales has been fully costed at &#163;10 million for three years, and that sum has been committed by the Welsh Assembly. I hope that the Parliament, through scrutinising the <place-holder colnum=\"24380\"/> minister and his work, ensures that any strategy is fully costed to enable it to work so that the findings of the consultation can be turned into reality.</p><p>The minister has outlined the aims and objectives of the strategy. I support those aims and objectives, but as I have said to the minister on previous occasions, some issues concern me. For example, I wonder whether the 12-week consultation period is adequate. Will groups and individuals be able to respond within that period? Will the 12-week period for the collation of information be sufficient to bring about the launch of the strategy in December? Will there be a national advertising campaign to alert groups and individuals to the consultation so that they can get hold of the forms and send them in? It is imperative that we get the strategy right at the start.</p><p>My colleagues will focus on a number of the areas referred to in the Scottish National Party's amendment, but I wish to mention some of them briefly. First, food preparation under free personal care has become a postcode lottery. That problem must be resolved. The Executive said that it would issue revised guidance to local authorities but I believe that that has not yet happened. I would like a response from the minister on that. Secondly, care homes are closing almost weekly and older people have nowhere to go. There is a lack of secure tenancies for people in care homes, which leaves older people vulnerable. That issue should be covered in the strategy. I know that the issue is complex, and not just from a financial point of view, as we must also consider the suitability of buildings.</p><p>Some exciting developments are happening, and I hope that the strategy will tap into developments in the Parliament, such as Scotland's futures forum. The forum, which is based in the Parliament, was set up to promote new and fresh thinking and is embarking on a project on age issues. I look forward to seeing its report. Members of the forum are going to an international conference in Copenhagen in June, and then the forum will host a conference in 24 November in the Parliament, at which it will launch the results of its work. I hope that that will be possible to feed that work into the Executive's strategy. We should congratulate the forum on its ingenuity.</p><p>I have an article here entitled \"Lords condemns government attitude to ageing\". Obviously, that is a reference to the Westminster Government's attitude to aging, as the Scottish Parliament is at the forefront on aging. Perhaps Westminster can learn something from us&#8212;we will lead rather than follow. The Lords said that the Westminster Government seems to consider an aging population a burden, not an opportunity. I believe <place-holder colnum=\"24381\"/> that an aging population represents an opportunity.</p><p>That brings me to pensions. The SNP amendment says that moneys and autonomy should be handed over to the Scottish Parliament. Other countries have had innovative ideas. In Switzerland, for instance, people can work up to five years beyond the statutory retirement age to increase their state pension&#8212;all facilitated by the Swiss Government. We have to consider such ideas. At this week's meeting of the Equal Opportunities Committee, the minister said that if we do not have the powers to implement in Scotland ideas that emerge from the consultation, they will be fed back to Westminster.</p><p>Other good, innovative ideas are being implemented in other countries. For example, we should consider ideas such as reducing hours at work with no financial penalty, job sharing or shortening the working week five years prior to retirement and using the pension fund&#8212;if one is still available&#8212;to top up salary levels.</p><p>In Scotland, we are good at freeing up employees to undertake voluntary work without loss of pay in the pre-retirement period. We have been doing that for many years, and as we have just launched a national strategy for older volunteers, we should give more thought to that area. Older people want to volunteer but they do not want to be penalised by having to give up their work. We should feed that suggestion into Westminster if we do not have the powers to act on it in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>Growing older should not be thought of as a burden or anything negative; basically, it should be celebrated. The older people whom I have met celebrate their old age; they go back to education and, if they want to work, they should be allowed to. I sincerely hope that the evidence that we get from the consultation proves that, although older people have concerns, they are not all about care and health but about the fact that they want to contribute to Scottish society. It is up to us to enable them to do that.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-4164.1, to leave out from \"and welcomes\" to end and insert:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"notes, however, the injustice of charging for food preparation under the free personal care legislation, ageism, fuel poverty and associated excess winter deaths, the punitive council tax and the discredited basic state pension, all of which deprive our elderly population of independence, security and choice, and recognises that until Scotland has power over tax and benefits many of Scotland's pensioners will continue to live in poverty.\"</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13358698", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Aging Population Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That was nice of Duncan McNeil&#8212;normally he does not hear me or, if he does, he does not listen.

Many of the <place-holder colnum=\"24096\"/> people who marched live in poverty in Scotland and I will touch on local as well as international issues. We accept absolutely that there is no comparison between levels of poverty in Scotland and those in Malawi and other areas but, to people who live in deprivation in a country that is as rich in resources as Scotland is, their situation is very real.</p><p>It has not yet been mentioned that the real reason for poverty is inequality in the distribution of wealth. Once we sort that out, I hope that we will start to eradicate poverty, not only in Scotland, but worldwide. It angers and saddens me that, as members have mentioned, my city of Glasgow has within its boundaries 17 of the poorest areas in Scotland, including the 10 most deprived areas. In Glasgow, 41 per cent of households live in poverty. Glasgow has three quarters of Scotland's poorest areas and one third of Scotland's worst council wards.</p><p>Murdo Fraser mentioned life expectancy. Scotland's average male life expectancy is 64 years, which is lower than that in Bosnia, Lebanon, the Gaza strip, Iran and North Korea. I make that point particularly for Des McNulty and Helen Eadie. Labour has been in control in their areas and in Glasgow for decades. I ask the Labour members what they plan to do about the terrible figures that I have just mentioned. They cannot pat themselves on the back for their efforts to get rid of poverty in Glasgow and the rest of Scotland.</p><p>I turn to the bigger issue of world poverty and the make poverty history campaign. I sincerely thank and pay tribute to Jubilee Scotland and the trade justice movement for their continuing work to ensure that the issue is kept on the agenda of all Governments, particularly ours. The issue is not only for Westminster; as has been mentioned, we can do a lot in Scotland. Jamie Stone mentioned the money that we have spent, but, as Linda Fabiani said, the Basque Country and Catalonia give money directly to tackle world poverty, so the Scottish Parliament could do more.</p><p>As various members have mentioned, debt relief, increased aid and trade justice must be paramount. As Patrick Harvie said, Governments have choices, but, unfortunately, people in the poorer countries simply do not. It is not acceptable that countries that have been brought to their knees by poverty are even more disadvantaged as a result of the strict criteria that developed countries have put in place. Dennis Canavan mentioned some of those countries&#8212;the UK, the other EU countries and America are among them. Many members have mentioned trade justice, although perhaps we should rename it trade injustice. I concur with all the comments that members have made on the issue. How can it be <place-holder colnum=\"24097\"/> right that rich countries such as ours, and America and the EU, use subsidies to dump their products on poor countries and so stifle those countries' economic growth? Countries end up in a cycle of never-ending debt and borrowing, which leads to the collapse of their economies.</p><p>All too often, western Governments blame the people and Governments in poor countries. As Linda Fabiani said, we must examine certain Governments, but not all Governments of poor countries are corrupt. We could say that some of the actions of our Government are corrupt, too. We must stop the spiral that is created when western countries set strict criteria on trade and debt relief. Rich nations have a duty to ensure that justice is delivered in poorer countries. We should continue our campaign, collectively and individually, to ensure that we bring justice and make poverty history.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13357904", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Make Poverty History"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate the independent group on using its time to debate poverty.

I support the Executive's motion and I am glad that it supports our amendment.</p><p>International women's day is to be celebrated not just here in Scotland, but throughout the world because it represents recognition of the role that women everywhere play. In her speech, Christine Grahame will mention some facts about women in Africa and other countries. We should bear in mind that although women in Scotland have struggled on equal pay and various other issues, some women who live in Africa and other countries have a much more difficult time of it. On international <place-holder colnum=\"23740\"/> women's day, it is apt that we take account of the international aspect of the difficulties that women face. That is why I refer to equal pay and sex trafficking in my amendment, which I will deal with later.</p><p>I welcome to Parliament the visiting representatives of women's groups and look forward to meeting them at tonight's reception.</p><p>We must consider the various roles that women play in today's society, as well as those that they have played in the past and those that they will play in the future. The women who keep not just families, but whole communities, together certainly deserve our praise because they often get little help. Women frequently earn low pay, work long and unsociable hours, and cannot get on the ladder of success simply because they are women.</p><p>The minister mentioned the various ways in which we have moved on over the years but, as she said, there is still much to do: we have much more to do to tackle sex discrimination, which, unfortunately, like low pay and the exploitation of women and children, is still with us.</p><p>The figures show that 47 per cent of people in the labour market are women and yet women are underrepresented in positions of power. For example, only 22 per cent of Scottish councillors, 10 per cent of senior police officers and 18 per cent of secondary school heads are women. On hearing those figures, all members will admit that we have a long way to go, but if all members of the Scottish Parliament and everyone in the country works together, I am sure we will see some movement on the issue.</p><p>I think that many members have signed Cathy Peattie's motion to mark international women's day this year. It says that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"while over thirty years have elapsed since the Sex Discrimination Act was passed, the Equal Pay Act came into force and the Equal Opportunities Commission was established, the commission reports that the gender pay gap is the worst in the European Union\".</p><p>I am sure that Cathy Peattie will pick up on that in her speech. We should do everything in our power to rectify the situation. We should also put to industry the part that it has to play. It may be possible for training to be given that challenges gender stereotyping, and for careers advice to encourage young women to take up alternative careers.</p><p>The modern apprenticeship scheme could also be used. One scheme in Glasgow now attracts a greater number of girls&#8212;it would have been unheard of in the past for girls to become apprentices. Obviously, the careers advice that those girls received led them to take up an apprenticeship, which will lead them to a good job <place-holder colnum=\"23741\"/> with decent pay. We have to look at the options, such as modern apprenticeships, by which girls can gain skills for work.</p><p>It is no longer acceptable that women are expected to do certain jobs. As the minister said, women should not be directed into certain jobs just because they are thought of as women's jobs. Ultimately, those jobs are the low-paid jobs. We have to look at other ways of addressing the problem. We cannot allow the majority of the workforce to continue to be discriminated against in pay terms.</p><p>Today, a committee of the European Parliament is debating forced prostitution in the context of Germany's hosting of the world cup. I congratulate the European Parliament on bringing the issue to the fore: trafficking and prostitution is an issue that we should address in the Scottish Parliament.</p><p>At the European Parliament, the motion calls on the Parliament to have regard to article 5 of the European charter of fundamental rights, which states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"trafficking in human beings is prohibited\".</p><p>The motion asks the Parliament to have regard</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to its resolution of 17 January 2006 on strategies to prevent the trafficking of women and children who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation\"</p><p>and welcomes the German national council of women red card to forced prostitution campaign, which I have signed up to. I am sure that other members have also done so. The aim of the campaign is to end the practice of forced prostitution.</p><p>The motion calls for</p><p class=\"indent\">\"transnational cooperation and exchange of best practice\"</p><p>and concludes by instructing the president of the European Parliament</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, and the governments of the member States, candidates and accession countries.\"</p><p>I congratulate the European Parliament on the motion. I hope that the Scottish Parliament will write to the president of the European Parliament to say that we will play our full part in the process. The world cup should not be used as a reason for increased use of trafficking and forced prostitution in Germany. We should also raise the matter with FIFA and with those who represent Scottish football fans.</p><p>The background notes to the debate in the European Parliament include an estimate that 40,000 women will be brought into Germany to be used as prostitutes during the world cup. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it is an absolute disgrace that people are talking about setting up portacabin brothels in <place-holder colnum=\"23742\"/> a city in Germany just because the world cup will be held there.</p><p>I hope that members agree that we should write to the European Parliament with our congratulations. There is nothing worse than the exploitation of women, except when, as has happened in this case, the media are involved in encouraging that exploitation. It is unforgivable that that can happen in this day and age, especially given that Germany now has a woman chancellor.</p><p>We talk about celebrating women. We have much to celebrate, but if we want to get to the crux of the problem that I am describing, we must target men. We must tell men that it is unacceptable that women should be moved into a country to be used in such a disgraceful way, just because some football matches are to be held there. I hope that members will support any measure to prevent such activity. As I said, there is talk of 40,000 women&#8212;they are described as prostitutes&#8212;being taken to Germany during the world cup.</p><p>Trafficking is not new, unfortunately, but it seems to be the scourge of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. In my home town, Glasgow, and in other areas, young girls who have been trafficked have been found in saunas and sex shops that were&#8212;eventually&#8212;raided. We cannot live with such a situation, which exists not just in one city but throughout the country.</p><p>Trish Godman will probably mention trafficking, because she has lodged a motion on the trafficking of women into prostitution. The trafficking of women and young children is evil and degrading. Although we have much to celebrate on international women's day, we must all consider the unfortunate women who have been and are being trafficked and we must ask the Parliament to do everything in its power to end this degrading activity.</p><p>I thank the minister for her support for my amendment and move amendment S2M-4063.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"however, notes that 30 years after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 came into force, the pace of change remains painfully slow; further notes with great concern the trafficking of women throughout Europe, and calls on the Executive to do all in its power to stop this horrific practice.\"</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13357130", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: International Women's Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for accepting the Scottish National Party's amendment.

However, as always, the devil is in the detail and I will expand on that as I go on.</p><p>My colleague, Christine Grahame, was right about the level of poverty in the population, particularly among children and pensioners. We should be reminded that if it was not for the legacy of past unionist Governments, our country would not be in such poverty. I do not know whether we are allowed to use the word \"lies\" in Parliament, but untruths were certainly told about the amount of oil and wealth that Scotland could have had in the early 1970s. Perhaps if we had been told the truth, we would not be having this debate today. We must recognise that. The Westminster Government should apologise to the Scottish people for what it has done. No other country would put up with it and we should all hang our heads in shame that a unionist Government was allowed to get away with it. Therefore, I congratulate Christine Grahame on her speech.</p><p>I sometimes think that Glasgow&#8212;the area that I represent&#8212;should be renamed the phoenix. Glasgow has reinvented itself time and time again, and some areas have reinvented themselves very well. The minister mentioned housing. Of course, housing is being built along the banks of the Clyde, but only for people who can afford to pay &#163;250,000 or more for it. At the same time, and straight across the road, the typical high flats&#8212;which are not unlike the &#163;250,000 flats&#8212;are being bulldozed by the Glasgow Housing Association and people are being moved out of their communities.</p><p>If we are talking about regeneration, let us think about communities as well&#8212;as Karen Whitefield rightly said. Communities deserve to be regenerated, but perhaps that should happen in areas that are actually communities; we must remember that. The GHA was set up by the Executive and it is an absolute disgrace. Local housing organisations are banging at the doors of the Executive and Communities Scotland asking them to look at the GHA because they cannot go on to secondary transfer. The Executive made a promise, but they are not able to move on to secondary transfer because there is a funding shortfall of &#163;300 million.</p><p>Let us also not forget that, although the GHA is <place-holder colnum=\"23626\"/> a social landlord, it has the highest rents of any landlord in Glasgow. That is an absolute disgrace. The minister talks about regenerating communities, but I would like to see him regenerate them by giving them proper control over their housing and not leaving the GHA to tell them what to do.</p><p>On transport, Glasgow needs to have closure on the crossrail scheme, which would open up the whole of Glasgow and Ayr. Someone coming from Edinburgh would not need to change trains. The idea has been on the cards for 25 to 30 years. I ask the minister for an answer on that as well as on a transport strategy for Glasgow.</p><p>Will the minister explain exactly what urban regeneration companies will do? Before he tells me that I have not read the document&#8212;I have&#8212;I will go through some of the organisations that already exist for regeneration. We have LECs. As we all know, Scottish Enterprise gets a block of money, takes out a large chunk for its own administration and hands the rest to the LECs, which take out large chunks to meet their administration costs. We used to have 48 social inclusion partnerships, and I could go on about some of them all day. They all had administration costs. We also had community planning partnerships, which are now community regeneration funds.</p><p>I ask the minister, sincerely, whether the regeneration companies will be headed by someone. Will they be in a building? Will all the companies that I mentioned sign up to a memorandum of understanding, as mentioned on page 23 of the policy statement? Are we creating new bodies or simply duplicating existing ones? How many people will be employed and what exactly will they do? From reading the policy statement, I cannot see what they will do that is not already being done.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356859", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Any debate or policy that attempts to address regeneration and deprivation is to be welcomed.

Having spoken to social workers, I am afraid that things do not change very quickly. They are still experiencing some of the unpleasant aspects of social work that Trish Godman experienced. However, I am sure that she also had some uplifting moments.</p><p>Although a review of social services was long overdue, I welcome the group's report. Social workers have a demanding job. The focus is always on the failures of the system, which have been highlighted, and the tragic consequences <place-holder colnum=\"23305\"/> that those have. Often the invaluable work that social workers do goes unnoticed. Social work is a difficult job. Unfortunately, the press tends to concentrate only on the failures and never on the successes of social services. People should have more confidence in social workers and should recognise that they do a very good job.</p><p>Social workers are not the only people who work in social services. As Carolyn Leckie pointed out, there are also carers, home helps, domestics and other workers. Social workers are on the front line. Theirs can be a hard and lonely career path to travel. The many strengths of the present system are recognised in the review group's excellent report. It is also up front in mentioning the challenges that social workers and the service face. I am usually the first to comment on glossy reports that are not written in plain English, but Susan Deacon has already made that point. This report is concise. It identifies both the strengths and the weaknesses of social services.</p><p>If we want a modern social services system, we must take on the report's recommendations and the independent advice from social workers and users of social services. The minister recognises the challenges ahead and that it will take a long time to meet them. That is an honest answer. We cannot simply believe that three months down the line all the changes that the report recommends will have been implemented. Although joined-up thinking between the various agencies is needed, not just social work but society as a whole must be involved in making those changes. After all, we are products of the society in which we live.</p><p>It is important that social workers should be allowed to use their experience and initiative, without being tied down by red tape. They should not have to spend all their time writing reports and must be given the flexibility to be involved in initiatives to deliver services locally, without having to seek a decision from the paraphernalia and bureaucracy at head office. That is one of the review group's most important recommendations. I have been talking about social workers, but such an approach would also give people who use the services of social workers and others confidence and pride in the services that they are receiving. I hope that the direct involvement of service users will give them the confidence to become responsible citizens and that the report's recommendations will bring about a shift from a dependency culture, in which services are simply received, to a system in which people can input into services and feel much better about themselves.</p><p>Other members referred to social workers' lack of confidence in their management teams. Some social services staff feel that they are not fully <place-holder colnum=\"23306\"/> supported by their managers. The report states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"employing organisations should resource employees to deliver first class services.\"</p><p>It also says that managers and line managers are bogged down by pressures of management and budget considerations, and suggests that those responsibilities be taken away from them, so that they can have a better understanding of the issues that affect front-line staff.</p><p>Trish Godman said that social workers might not understand the \"punters\", as we might call them. People who go straight into social work from university may not know about life, so perhaps they should not be put into a one-to-one situation. Glasgow City Council does not have a policy on lone working for social services, but I do not know whether that is the case in every sphere of social work in every local authority. The council does not prioritise resources for simple things such as mobile phones for its social work staff. Housing officers get mobile phones, but social workers, who are often in threatening situations, do not. I will not name names, as I do not want to go into individual cases. However, I find it worrying that social workers in Glasgow may find themselves in threatening situations but be unable to contact someone immediately. Social workers who have not been trained in lone working may find themselves in a close in a deprived area with only one light. I would like that point to be taken on board, perhaps not now but in the future. Mobile phones and training in lone working should be compulsory for all social workers.</p><p>Social workers should be furnished with other fundamental tools. Last night I attended a meeting in Glasgow about children's panels. People told me that there were still advertisements in social work departments advising them to attend a children's hearing if they want to find out what goes on there. Along with mobile phones and lone working policies, attendance at children's hearings should be a compulsory, fundamental tool for all social workers, to make life easier for them and to help them to serve their clients.</p><p>Euan Robson said that social workers should learn to value themselves. That is fine and dandy, but social workers often feel that they are not valued by their employers. It is difficult for people to value themselves if they feel that their employer does not value them. Susan Deacon made that point and said that social workers should sing their own praises. I agree, but without a culture change in society that call will fall on deaf ears, among the public and social workers alike. I hope that the report will change attitudes.</p><p>Adam Ingram, Carolyn Leckie and others mentioned the underfunding of social work <place-holder colnum=\"23307\"/> services. Professor Midwinter arrived at the figure of &#163;135 million, which is significant. The issue must be looked at, because there is a 40 per cent shortage in the recruitment of front-line social workers in the Glasgow area. The retention of social workers is equally important. That is a big problem: we may be able to recruit, but we cannot retain front-line social work staff because of the difficult situations in which they find themselves. I agree with Robert Brown's answer to Patrick Harvie's question about funding. We must examine the funding provision that we are making.</p>", "hdate": "2006-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356097", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Social Work"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Trish Godman for her honest, straightforward and informative speech.

I am sorry that <place-holder colnum=\"23235\"/> the ministers seem more interested in the Tory plot over there than they are in the speeches, but perhaps that tells us something about the ministers. We come here to debate and we expect answers and announcements from the Executive; it is not about platitudes or patting people on the back. I am not being dismissive of volunteers; I am saying to the ministers that they should take volunteering much more seriously. It has been mentioned throughout the debate that volunteers come to us every other day about core funding. We want answers. Here is a ministerial statement, but no motion on which to vote. We are speaking in a debate that gives no answers to people out there. The Executive should consider closely its agenda and not waste the Parliament's time on a debate such as this, when a members' debate on volunteering would have had the same outcome.</p><p>I thought that there might have been consensus in the debate, but the Tories have broken it. If Mr Cameron wanted his name constantly mentioned here, why did he not stand for the Scottish Parliament? It is a disgrace that the Tories mention Mr Cameron. On behalf of the many thousands of volunteers in Scotland who want an answer from the Executive, the Tories should tell Mr Cameron to stand for the Scottish Parliament and to stop electioneering. The Tories are no better than the Executive.</p><p>As other members have said, we must celebrate volunteering, but it is also important to give volunteers something to celebrate. Core funding has been raised time and again in the debate by members from all parties. I would like the minister to answer a couple of questions on funding. Strategic funding was first mentioned in 2000; then the Executive said that it hoped to report back in 2004. Now, six years down the line, we have the minister's admission that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Strategic Funding Review aims to improve the availability\"</p><p>of funding, but that it</p><p class=\"indent\">\"will be implemented over the next year to 18 months.\"</p><p>Will the minister be more specific about the date? We have waited six years, only be told that the plan</p><p class=\"indent\">\"will be implemented over the next year to 18 months.\"</p><p>The volunteers out there want to know an exact date and they want to know exactly what is happening with strategic funding. That is what debates in the Parliament are all about: getting answers, not platitudes.</p><p>I commend the minister for considering older people in volunteering. Although, quite rightly, he mentioned youth volunteers throughout his speech&#8212;the aim of ProjectScotland is to encourage young people to begin volunteering&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"23236\"/> we all know that the vast majority of volunteers are older people. We have an ageing population and a golden opportunity to produce a strategy, so I welcome the minister's announcement that he will produce a paper. I have raised it time and again with the minister, while older volunteers have also asked for the matter to be addressed. However, we do not have a date for that report either. That makes two issues for which no date has been given: the strategic funding review and the report on a strategy for older volunteers. I would like answers on those issues.</p><p>We have missed out another great swathe of the population: disabled volunteers. The report on volunteering and disability is good; I hope that the minister will try to take its recommendations further, one of which is as simple as improving access to buildings to enable disabled people to volunteer. Another recommendation concerns engaging in information. Those are two core issues that are raised in the report&#8212;I hope that the minister will take them up.</p><p>We welcome and celebrate volunteering, but it must not replace core services. We must take it on board that that is happening in various areas. The Executive is making cuts to councils left, right and centre, and some core services that are run by councils, such as after-school care, are having to be taken over by volunteers. If that is the Executive's approach to volunteering, we will struggle dearly to get more people to volunteer. People volunteer because they get great pleasure out of it and learn from it; they do not want to be used to replace core services.

That is one form of communication that we can all do without at times. I also congratulate her on securing the debate.</p><p>As Nanette Milne mentioned, an estimated 250,000 people in Scotland suffer from a communication impairment. I use the word \"estimated\" because, unlike deaf or deafblind people and people with hearing or visual impairments of other sorts for which figures are available, no accurate figures exist for people who need communication support. We desperately need the research that has been carried out to be taken further, as such information is essential for developing a framework to address the needs of people who have a communication impairment.</p><p>Communication impairments can affect anyone. People can develop a form of communication impairment&#8212;such as a stammer, which Ken Macintosh mentioned&#8212;after suffering head injuries in a car accident or after suffering a stroke. It is very sad that not enough support is provided to help such people.</p><p>Like Ken Macintosh, I want to raise the issues that affect people who have a stammer. We need only imagine what it would be like to be unable to communicate properly such that, in attempting to communicate, one became a laughing stock. That is the impression that people have of those who have a stammer and that is very sad indeed.</p><p>We perhaps need a policy whereby people are made more aware of certain types of communication problems. If we had that, people would perhaps not be ridiculed or become the butt of jokes in the way that we see happening all too often on television and in the media. The issue of communication impairment should be looked at rather than laughed at.</p><p>Basically, if we had more speech therapists for people with stammers and other forms of communication impairment, that would go a long way towards rectifying the problem. I hope that the minister will take on board the need for more speech and language therapists. If we started with people at an early age, we could do something to help them. Such help is sadly lacking, as has been mentioned time and again.</p><p>When people with a communication impairment access education and health services, they are <place-holder colnum=\"22646\"/> sometimes looked on as being incompetent. However, as Eleanor Scott mentioned, the mental health services that are provided in Scotland are not guaranteed to meet the needs of such people, especially those who are deaf or deafblind.</p><p>There is a petition before the Parliament that seeks some form of unit for deaf and deafblind people who have mental health problems. At the moment, some of those people get no help whatever when they have a mental health problem, whether they are in Aberdeen, Glasgow or anywhere else in Scotland, because there is no dedicated service for them. I hope that the minister will look into that.</p><p>The issue of employment has been mentioned. If someone with a communication impairment goes for a job, they are sometimes not given the job or given a lowly job. They are looked on as being less intelligent than others, but I am sure that if people were educated about their impairment that would satisfy the employer as well as other employees. We must address that issue.</p><p>Much has been said about the inquiry into how many people suffer from communication impairment. As Nanette Milne and others have mentioned, the social research unit has produced figures on that. It would be helpful to know from the minister when proposals will be brought forward. I know that the Executive has been considering them for five or six months.

I hope that in any meeting, the minister will mention the benefit trap in which many people find themselves and its debilitating effect on people who are trying to get into work. That is important and must be raised time and again. One way of getting people back into work is through an overhaul of the benefits system.</p><p>In his opening remarks, the minister said that opportunities should exist for all and that no one should be left behind. We must ensure that that happens. I endorse everything that the minister said. There was a tiny mention of ethnic minorities in his speech, but he did not mention disabled people or people with impairments, although I am sure that that was not deliberate. He may shake his hands, but disabled people and people with impairments are important. The minister did not mention refugees either. If he is serious about not leaving anyone behind, he should agree that such people should be actively targeted in order to get them back into work; they provide a great pool of talent. Such people want to work, although they cannot do so at certain times. That is not only the result of the benefits system, but because they are least likely to get good training and a good education. Access to employment is difficult for <place-holder colnum=\"22363\"/> them and when they get back into work, they are sometimes actively discriminated against.</p><p>What prevents disabled people and people with impairments getting into work? People want to work, and there is a huge amount of untapped talent out there. As a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee I participated in its disability inquiry. During that inquiry, the issue of the benefits system was constantly raised. The second issue that was raised is the lack of information. If there is information, people do not know how to access it.

I thank, too, Age Concern and all the many voluntary groups whose members give of their time and expertise to help our elder people throughout the year, but particularly during the winter months.</p><p>The debate is timely, given that the predictions are that we will have the worst winter for 40 years. That is very concerning, given the excess winter deaths that that would cause throughout Scotland and in Glasgow in particular. A study that was done by Energy Action Scotland and the University of Strathclyde found that most pensioners in Glasgow were at risk and that the over-65s in Glasgow were more at risk of dying in <place-holder colnum=\"21849\"/> the winter months than over-65s anywhere else in Scotland. We must take that very seriously. I hope that the minister and others will look at that issue.</p><p>Like Paul Martin, I recognise the work that the Parliament is doing; we should be grateful for that work and welcome it. However, when one in 36 of Glasgow's over-65s dies every winter, it is obvious that not enough is being done. There are benefits to the work that the Parliament is doing, but there are also barriers.</p><p>Elderly people find it very difficult to access benefits, and I would like the minister and the Parliament to look at the forms that have to be filled in. Pensioners are very proud people and sometimes they do not want to access benefits. However, that is an argument for another day. Filling in forms is very difficult. I have difficulty when I am helping elderly people to fill in forms and I know that they find it difficult too. We must put more emphasis on providing advice on what people can claim and how they should fill in the forms.</p><p>I agree with what Paul Martin said about the utility companies. That relates not just to fuel poverty, but to the multiple deprivation that is creeping in. Despite what the First Minister said earlier, there is multiple deprivation and it accounts for the excess winter deaths in the Glasgow area. The Scottish index of multiple deprivation, which is published by the Scottish Executive, names Glasgow as the worst region in terms of multiple deprivation. We need a holistic, joined-up approach. We have to target the agencies that target the pensioners. Those agencies link health, housing and social issues. We should not consider fuel poverty and benefits in isolation.</p><p>I ask the Scottish Executive to examine the Welsh Assembly Government's \"The Strategy for Older People in Wales\", which led to the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee that considers older people's needs and experiences and what it is like to be an older person. The strategy, which highlights the issues that affect older people in Wales, is an excellent document and I ask the minister and the Executive to emulate it. The Welsh Cabinet sub-committee considers the issues in a co-ordinated way and takes a holistic approach. It considers not just present needs, but changing demography and the ever-changing needs of elderly people in Wales. The strategy forms an important part of the Welsh Assembly Government's plans.</p><p>We have heard that one of the huge post offices in Glasgow is to close down and we are looking at similar closures throughout Scotland, including in rural areas. One item that is included in the action plan in the Welsh strategy is:<place-holder colnum=\"21850\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"Develop Post Offices as community economic development centres.\"</p><p>Instead of being closed, post offices are being opened up so that people can access not just their pensions but community facilities. I ask the minister to look carefully at the Welsh strategy. She might not be able to commit herself today, but I ask her seriously to consider producing a similar strategy for older people in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2005-12-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13352391", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Excess Winter Deaths (Greater Glasgow)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Paul Martin for securing the debate.

Unless the sentence is more than four years, people have no right to find out the release date. The police cannot find out either. The victim notification scheme really has to be revisited. If someone has perpetrated that type of violence&#8212;attempted murder&#8212;they should get more than three years. All violent assailants should be given sentences that fit the crime.

I have been a member of the Public Petitions Committee in both sessions of <place-holder colnum=\"21002\"/> the Parliament, so I can see how it has developed and I understand the reason for the concerns that were expressed to the Procedures Committee. A lot more petitions are being lodged now, which shows what a success story the Public Petitions Committee is and how popular the petitions system has become.</p><p>I will concentrate on three main areas, one of which is different from those on which Donald Gorrie focused. First, I agree with the recommendation that MSPs should not submit petitions. Most of the MSPs with whom I have had contact agree that there are other ways in which we can pursue issues that are raised in petitions. After all, the committee is called the Public Petitions Committee and, like Donald Gorrie, I think that it should be for the public. Members have the privilege of being able to speak to petitions when they are lodged&#8212;petitioners do not always have that privilege&#8212;and when the committee considers them later. Petitions are sometimes sent to other committees to consider or for their information. The Public Petitions Committee should be left open to the public. I have no problem with the recommendation on the lodging of petitions by MSPs.</p><p>The second main area, which has caused concern to me and to some members of the public, is the resubmission of petitions. I welcome the Procedures Committee's recommendations, which are sensible. Some members of the public attempt to make unfair use of the system. However, although the system can be abused, we must ensure that we protect the rights of the majority of genuine petitioners. That is why the Procedures Committee's recommendation is absolutely correct. To refuse to admit a petition that is similar to one that has been lodged in the same session and closed in the past year, but only if it is lodged by or on behalf of the same individual or group, is a protective mechanism that goes some way towards ensuring that the process is open and transparent.</p><p>The third main area of concern is the admissibility of petitions, which I have raised a number of times. Petitioners have contacted me about the fact that their petition has been ruled inadmissible. I acknowledge the amount of work that the clerks do in contacting and advising petitioners about their petitions, but I worry that members will not be made aware of petitions that are deemed inadmissible unless the petitioners contact them. I seek assurance from the convener of the Procedures Committee or the convener of the Public Petitions Committee that when a clerk explains to someone that their petition is not admissible, they will also tell them that if they disagree with that recommendation, the Public Petitions Committee will make a final decision on admissibility. For the rule change to work properly <place-holder colnum=\"21003\"/> and sensibly, the clerk must explain to the petitioner why the petition is inadmissible&#8212;I know that the clerks do that just now&#8212;and tell them that if they disagree with the decision, they are entitled to seek a final decision from the committee.</p><p>I have been approached, as have other MSPs, by petitioners asking about the admissibility of petitions. Would we be able to offer them advice? I congratulate the Procedures Committee on its sensible recommendations, but I have concerns and I would welcome clarification on whether, under the rule change, the clerk will have to tell petitioners that if they deem the information or advice that they have received to be incorrect, they can take the petition to the Public Petitions Committee, which has the ultimate responsibility in determining whether it is admissible.</p>", "hdate": "2005-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13350253", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Petitions"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the Procedures Committee.

There is no doubt that air pollution has dire chronic health consequences&#8212;not only do people suffer ill health, but they die sooner because of the terrible pollution in Glasgow city centre.</p><p>I will cite a couple of examples that we have all seen. How many times have we been in Glasgow&#8212;on Hope Street, Queen Street or around George Square&#8212;and seen 16 or more <place-holder colnum=\"20422\"/> buses parked next to each other in gridlock, belching out noxious fumes? What can be seen at the traffic lights? People with children in buggies that are level with the pollution that is coming out of the buses, which damages the children's health. Those kids have no choice, because they are waiting at the traffic lights and the buses are gridlocked. As politicians, we must give them a choice.</p><p>It is up to us to ensure that walking about Glasgow and its outskirts is safer with regard to air pollution. That is why I am concerned that Glasgow City Council has not made use of every possible piece of legislation. Reducing the number of vehicles in the city centre would go some way towards creating less pollution. Glasgow City Council is progressing with some measures. I welcome the exhaust emissions tests, under which people can be fined &#163;60 if they are pulled over by the police and their vehicle's exhaust emissions are too high. However, that does not stop the worst pollution, which is the problem. Patrick Harvie mentioned public transport&#8212;it is true that we need more of it, but the vast majority of the pollution comes from the buses in our city centre.</p><p>The heilanman's umbrella has been mentioned many times, but pollution is a problem throughout the city centre. Charlie Gordon will be familiar with Scotstoun, which is outside the city centre; buses sit outside people's houses there and run their engines for 20 minutes or half an hour, yet there is no legislation to stop that.

I was going to read them out clause by clause, but because I have only five minutes to speak, I do not have time to do so. The minister said that he raised those concerns with Westminster's Meg Munn, but he did not give us any answers as to whether Westminster will accept any of the points that the committee raised. For that reason, I do not know whether I can support the motion.</p><p>A number of areas concern me, and there are two particular problems to which we should have had answers. One involves clause 17 of the bill, on grant-giving powers. Given the geographical spread of Scotland and the various community organisations that will interact with the CEHR, if the Scottish commissioner does not have grant-giving powers, the grant allocations system might not work properly.</p><p>I am also concerned about clause 19, which involves the promotion of work with agencies. The CRE already works with various agencies and communities, so that power should be devolved. I hoped that the minister would tell me that the powers outlined in clauses 17 and 19 were to be devolved to the proposed new Scottish commissioner, but he has not so far. I hope that we will have an answer to that today.</p><p>A point that the minister has not mentioned but which was mentioned to me and to the Equal Opportunities Committee is that there will be only <place-holder colnum=\"19988\"/> one Scottish commissioner among 15 in the UK. That is totally inadequate in a UK context&#8212;we need more than just one commissioner to represent Scotland's issues. The commissioners will have to be knowledgeable about devolved areas, and one is not enough. I hoped that the minister would mention that matter.</p><p>Another question that concerns me is why a commissioner for Scotland should be appointed by UK ministers with the endorsement of Scottish ministers, rather than be appointed by this Parliament.</p><p>The minister touched on the establishment of the commission for equality and human rights, which raises another area of concern. I am worried about duplication. The Justice 1 Committee is currently scrutinising the Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill. Why are we using a Sewel motion to remove powers from a Scottish commissioner that we do not even have yet by giving them to Westminster?

A third-party right of appeal is SNP policy. I can get Murdo Fraser a copy of the manifesto so that he can read it.</p><p>Like other members, I think that the debate has been very good and that some good points have been made. There has perhaps been some point scoring on certain issues, but not from everyone.</p><p>I put forward my party's policies and point out that the idea of a third-party right of appeal comes from speaking to communities. The approach is about speaking to communities, listening to them and ensuring that we act on their wishes. I take Karen Whitefield's point that we cannot please everyone, but I say to her and to other members that we can ensure that there is some form of fairness. A third-party right of appeal is all about fairness and equality and we should consider those issues today.</p><p>We must be fair to businesses, but we must also be fair to communities, which, as has been mentioned, sometimes suffer from bad developments of various kinds. Wind farms can be one such development, but I am sure that Murdo Fraser will come back on that issue&#8212;a little birdie told me about that one.</p><p>I will address other aspects of the proposed planning bill. The white paper contains some good provisions. I have made that clear to the minister and at various meetings with community groups and others throughout Scotland during the recess. The updating of local plans is essential. We have always needed that to happen, as the situation has been ridiculous. Business representatives have stated that sometimes, when they are developing something, the local development plans do not catch up with them. The welcome proposal on the updating of the plans has emerged from meaningful dialogue with businesses, communities, members and local councillors.</p><p>Mary Scanlon picked up on COSLA's worries, which should be of concern to members and to the minister. What dialogue has taken place between the minister and COSLA? After all, local authorities will implement the plans. Local authorities need the resources, the manpower and the time to develop local development plans. If we do not ensure that they have those things, the plans will never be introduced.</p><p>I am pleased with the positive attempt to get developers to meet communities and to involve them in developments early on. Indeed, many communities have cried out for such an essential measure. However, as Rosemary Byrne pointed out, despite such involvement, we have no legislation to stop any development that goes ahead, even though there might be objections to it. Although there might be a strategy for involving <place-holder colnum=\"19744\"/> communities, it has no teeth. Communities can be lulled into a false sense of security by their involvement with developers and councils because, whatever happens, developers and councils will always get their way. If there is to be no third-party right of appeal, we should tell communities that, ultimately, their involvement in the process will have no teeth.</p><p>On consultation, Pauline McNeill mentioned that there were 800 objections to an application for a development in the west end of Glasgow. Although we all believed that those objectors had a good case, the development still went ahead. I say to her that it is all well and good to back communities in certain circumstances, but there is no easy road out of this problem. No one can sit on the fence and say that they back communities in certain circumstances. The only way in which those 800 objectors in Glasgow would have got anywhere was if they had had a third-party right of appeal.</p><p>Pauline McNeill and other members have said that they would like the bill to include some form of third-party right of appeal. However, we must examine the matter properly. Regardless of what anyone in the Parliament says, without such an appeal mechanism&#8212;which I believe Sarah Boyack eloquently described as a communities appeal&#8212;communities will be left in their current situation.</p><p>I have been to many public and community meetings at which the CBI and others have claimed that Scotland will disappear into a big black hole if it gets a third-party right of appeal. As Mike Rumbles and other members have pointed out, they should tell that to Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Australia. Those countries are not in a big black hole; indeed, their GDP is better than the UK's. Others claim that such a mechanism would be a meddlers charter and that it would give rise to serial objectors to developments. However, evidence from other countries that have third-party right of appeal suggests that that would not be the case. Indeed, evidence from Ireland shows that people tend to sit round a table and find a compromise before the matter reaches the appeals stage. Having recourse to third-party right of appeal gives communities the confidence to take such action.</p><p>A third-party right of appeal should form an important part of the proposed planning bill; in fact, I believe that even some Tory members might be considering an appeal mechanism for communities. I urge the Liberal Democrats and Labour to think about introducing some form of third-party right of appeal. As a footnote, I notice that, at Westminster, a Liberal Democrat MP&#8212;I cannot remember her name&#8212;is introducing a private member's bill on third-party right of appeal. We should bear that in mind, because if we do not <place-holder colnum=\"19745\"/> incorporate the measure in the planning bill, we might have to debate a Sewel motion on the matter a year or two from now.</p>", "hdate": "2005-10-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13346742", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No. Murdo Fraser should tell him that&#8212;I have already told Jim on many occasions.

The memorandum on delegated powers says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Subsection (1) gives Scottish Ministers power by order to designate types of HMOs which may be exempted from licensing by a local authority.\"</p><p>It goes on to say:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In particular, the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 provides for all private landlords to be registered with the local authority, having been passed as fit and proper persons to let property. It is thought that registration, and other developments, may provide sufficient control over some categories of HMO, without the need for licensing. This power would enable the Scottish Ministers to indicate that in general such HMOs need no longer be licensed.\"</p><p>I would like some clarification on that. Legislation on care homes was introduced in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, but I am concerned that if landlords are registering under the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 they no longer need to be licensed. Perhaps the minister could address that when she sums up.</p><p>I support ministers having the power to regulate the fees that are charged in relation to HMOs. For too long, fees in the Glasgow area have been extortionate compared with those in other areas. Regulation will provide uniformity and is a welcome addition to the bill.</p><p>I welcome the minister's commitment to consider the introduction of amendments at stage 2 on disability adaptations and grants, particularly if that involves reviewing the means testing and ring fencing of moneys in the private sector. I look forward to considering those amendments. The <place-holder colnum=\"18409\"/> minister said that he believes that it is not discriminatory for disabled people in Scotland not to have the same rights as disabled people elsewhere, but I disagree; I echo Karen Whitefield's comment that people in Scotland should not be disadvantaged compared with people in the rest of the United Kingdom. The fact that the Disability Rights Commission is a reserved body is being used as an excuse for denying disabled people in Scotland the same rights as disabled people have in the rest of the UK. The minister said that he will speak to his Westminster colleagues, and I look forward to hearing any response that he receives. Perhaps we could come up with our own legislation to protect disabled people.</p><p>From past evidence and from speaking to the disabled community, we know that the disabled are among the poorest in our society and that they pay more money for heating. It is essential that disabled people are treated more fairly, and more equally with everyone else in society. The moneys that disabled people receive are not nearly enough to cover their living expenses, let alone the adaptations that they need to live a normal life. The minister said that moneys were important. That is true&#8212;funding is crucial. The minister mentioned postcode prescribing, as we used to refer to it in the health service. However, in this case we are talking about postcode prescribing of adaptations and moneys for those adaptations. We must put a stop to that, and I welcome the minister's commitment to doing that. It is ridiculous that some local authorities provide more money for adaptations than others do.</p><p>The minister mentioned the removal of capping, which would be a positive step forward. However, I seek clarification because, although the minister said that he does not want capping, he also said that he may have to introduce means testing. He said that moneys and funding are important. Will there be an upper limit of grant before means testing is introduced?</p><p>The bill, and in particular the commitments to disabled people in Scotland, are overdue.

Ghana has come on in the world, but, unfortunately, Burkina Faso is in as bad a state as it was all those years ago. I was gobsmacked by the amount of work that women did in those areas to create co-operative farms so that they could educate their children&#8212;not just their sons, but their daughters, too&#8212;whom they had had to send away to get educated. The amazing thing was that when those children, particularly the girls, were educated, they did not want to leave their country; they wanted to stay there to educate others. That says something about women as a whole: they are not selfish, but wish to give something back through education or work. They want to see their communities take something from the hard work that they have put in. That is something from which not just the G8 leaders but leaders of all countries&#8212;particularly men&#8212;can learn.</p><p>Trish Godman is absolutely right that we must ensure that money goes not to dictatorships but to co-operatives in which women are working at grass-roots level and so see what is going on. In my studies, I found that those women worked hard in the co-operatives, which is where the money should be spent&#8212;we cannot afford to let it go to dictatorships.</p><p>Mary Scanlon said that, although the women work hard, they have no financial independence. That is why it is important that we in the Parliament, the G8 and countries throughout the world ensure that any money that is given in aid goes to people at grass-roots level.</p><p>All that might sound negative; we have to consider the positives as well.

Many members have mentioned Barnardo's centenary; however, we should also celebrate the fact that the organisation has moved with the times and developed various projects without losing its original ethos of looking after, caring and nurturing impoverished children, who sometimes come from chaotic backgrounds. We&#8212;and Barnardo's&#8212;should be very proud of that fact.</p><p>All too often, the kids who come from chaotic backgrounds go on to have chaotic lifestyles. In many cases, the kids themselves are blamed; <place-holder colnum=\"17997\"/> however, we should blame neither the children nor the parents. Instead, we should help them. In this modern world, it is too easy to lay the blame at the doorsteps of families and children when in fact all they need is some support and help, and I congratulate Barnardo's on providing such support. We should be very pleased that such organisations continue to carry out such work after 100 years; after all, as Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said, even though our society is more affluent, there is still poverty among us. I am glad that people are willing enough to help with these matters.</p><p>I want to concentrate on a number of initiatives that Barnardo's has introduced. Rosemary Byrne highlighted alcohol and substance abuse. To deal with that major problem, the organisation has established 361 projects throughout Great Britain, many of which work with parents who misuse alcohol. As a result of that work, Barnardo's has called for programmes that are designed specifically to help affected families and children. It is easy to say that we will spend money on that issue; however, if we do not know a particular family's circumstances, such money is not necessarily wasted but it does not always reach the proper areas. Perhaps we need a more inclusive approach in that respect. In any case, as Marlyn Glen, Robert Brown and Donald Gorrie have pointed out, money has to come into it somewhere&#8212;which, I am afraid to say, is where the minister herself comes into it. I realise that the Scottish Parliament supports the voluntary sector very well, but perhaps we should consider tailoring such projects to families' needs.</p><p>Marlyn Glen touched on domestic violence, on which I know that she has done a lot of work in the Equal Opportunities Committee.

As Jackie Baillie will know from consultation of her constituents and from meetings that she and I have attended, people want to come to Glasgow for services, but the decisions of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board and the Executive will have a significant impact on Glasgow. The issue must be revisited because it is not enough to have only two A and E hospitals for Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire and other areas. I had hoped that this morning's debate would allow us to probe the issues in the Kerr report, but unfortunately the Conservatives have not given us the opportunity to do that.</p><p>The position of maternity hospitals is not mentioned in the Kerr report. That issue, too, was the subject of flawed consultation. The people of West Dunbartonshire and the West of Scotland as a whole went to public meetings and signed petitions and there was a great deal of unrest. We still do not know what will happen to the Yorkhill hospitals, where maternity services in Glasgow will <place-holder colnum=\"17760\"/> be sited or when they will be moved elsewhere. Those questions must be answered. I had hoped that the Conservatives would seek to obtain such clarification during the debate, but it seems that written questions to the minister will be necessary.</p><p>We cannot afford to wait until after the recess. I am disappointed that we will not debate the issue for another few months because we do not know what decisions will be taken. I asked the minister what advice and guidance had been given to health boards in the past and what advice and guidance they would be given now, but I have received no answer. We must wait another three or four months, but we do not know what decisions the health boards will take in the meantime and what impact that will have on users&#8212;patients and the public&#8212;and the professionals who work in the health service. We should have had an answer, but by the time we get one, it may be too late.</p><p>Many members have spoken about staff retention and recruitment&#8212;an important issue about which there is a great deal of concern. A written answer from the minister shows that, in 2004, the number of medical graduates from Scottish universities fell by 61 to 727. At the same time, the proportion of those graduates who went to work outside Scotland rose from 9 per cent to 12 per cent. That is worrying.

I also thank the many witnesses who gave evidence and who in some cases&#8212;as the minister said&#8212;had suffered harrowing experiences. I also thank the many experts who gave evidence, whose knowledge of the terrible consequences of FGM was invaluable.</p><p>FGM has short-term and long-term consequences for the women who are subjected to it, their families and future generations. Sometimes, older women realise that they do not want the procedure to be carried out on their daughters, but have to have it done because of cultural and community pressures. Some such women were brave enough to speak to the committee's reporter Elaine Smith, and to the committee itself, so it is incumbent on us to thank them. The minister says that they might be here today. I thank them very much and welcome them to Scotland. When the bill is passed, it will offer them the full protection of the Scottish courts.</p><p>I use the term \"female\" deliberately because, as we all know, even babies can be the victims of FGM. It would not be right to describe young children, some of whom are as young as two years old, as women. We must ensure that everyone knows that FGM can be carried out on such young children. Unfortunately, that happens in certain areas of the world, but once the bill is passed it will not happen on Scottish soil or, if the person who tries to commit the offence is resident in Scotland, outwith Scotland.</p><p>I thank the minister for his continued dialogue with the committee. We had some good arguments with him about amendments to the bill that we wanted to make. I am very pleased that we will pass a bill that is not merely an equivalent of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, but is separate Scottish legislation. I accept what the minister said about reinfibulation&#8212;which I raised at stage 1 and stage 2&#8212;and the information that he has provided in his letter to the Subordinate Legislation Committee, and I welcome the amendments that deal with that.</p><p>I am glad, too, that specific reference has been made to the Somali women's action group and health professionals, who I assume will write the guidance. It is important that we reiterate to professionals such as social workers that FGM is <place-holder colnum=\"17330\"/> against the law. When the minister sums up, I would like him to mention the intended timescale for production of the guidance. Dr Hepburn has significant experience of dealing with women who have suffered the terrible experience of being subjected to FGM and I hope that she will work with the Somali women's action group, Comfort Momoh and others to produce the guidance. I look forward to hearing when it will be published.</p><p>I will touch on some of the amendments that have been outlined so far. Executive amendment 1, which amends section 1, alleviates many of my concerns and those of other committee members&#8212;no doubt they will raise them. Those concerns led to committee amendment 13 at stage 2, which was an important amendment, but one that led to difficulty for the minister and the committee. We got over those difficulties and I am pleased that the minister lodged amendment 8, which means that, if the bill needs to be changed in the future, an order will come before Parliament. It is fantastic that the minister took the issue on board. As I have said previously, the World Health Organisation may reconsider its definition of FGM, so it is important that we can come back to Parliament if that happens.</p><p>I am also particularly pleased at the extension of section 1, which relates directly to FGM being arranged outwith Scotland. As the minister said in his speech, it is a big step forward&#8212;indeed, it is groundbreaking legislation. People who come into our country as asylum seekers will now be fully protected from FGM. If anything happens to them, they will know that they have the full weight and protection of the law behind them. If a person is fleeing persecution and knows that FGM might be planned for them, I am sure that it will give them some comfort to know that Scotland will protect them.</p><p>I will conclude because many members want to speak in the debate. I am sure that every single person agrees that FGM in all its forms&#8212;not just in its most extreme form&#8212;is a vile, cruel and inhuman act. Through the bill, we must ensure that we reach out not only to the women who are affected by FGM but to the men in their communities. We have to make it clear to men and women in those communities that FGM will not be tolerated in our society.</p><p>I said that the bill is groundbreaking legislation, which it is, but I have heard folk outwith the chamber say that other matters are more important than FGM. If, by passing the bill, we save even one female from going through the terrible trauma of female genital mutilation, we will have done something good. I am very proud to have been involved.</p><p>I look forward to the day when we do not have to speak about female genital mutilation and when <place-holder colnum=\"17331\"/> the suffering of many thousands&#8212;maybe millions&#8212;of females throughout the world is ended. Scotland is leading the way. As I said, I am proud of the committee. I thank the minister and everyone else who was involved in the bill. This is legislation of which Parliament should be proud. It is an issue on which we can reach out to the world and on which we can say that we have done something that is slightly different from what Westminster has done. With the bill, we are saying to the rest of the world that female genital mutilation will not be tolerated, not just in Scotland but throughout the world.

I have been told that it has set a record. However, the \"Manifesto for Inclusion\" covers so many meaningful and important areas that I felt I could not leave anything out.</p><p>I congratulate Inclusion Scotland on producing such an excellent report and I welcome its representatives to the Scottish Parliament. They are behind me in the gallery. I thank them for all the work they have done. When I took them for a coffee earlier, they were at pains to tell me that the manifesto was written not only by them but by disabled people throughout Scotland. I thank them very much.<place-holder colnum=\"16892\"/></p><p>I am a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee and I want to thank the committee and its staff. At this very moment we are carrying out an inquiry into disability issues. Many people have spoken to me about the motion and they will agree that all the groups we have spoken to, and all the people who have contributed to our investigation in every area we have visited, have raised exactly the same concerns that the manifesto highlights. That says something about the work that Inclusion Scotland has done in producing its manifesto.</p><p>It is estimated that one in five of the population of Scotland is disabled. That is 1 million people&#8212;an awful lot of people. More than one in three households have a person who is either disabled or suffering from a long-term illness. Those people face discrimination in everyday life&#8212;in housing, education and employment. That is appalling.</p><p>In my speech, I want to cover a number of areas, highlighting particular concerns raised in the manifesto. The first is poverty. Approximately four in 10 of all households with a disabled person&#8212;42 per cent&#8212;have an income of &#163;10,000 or less.</p><p>The second is employment. Among the population of working age, 45 per cent of disabled people are in employment, compared with 82 per cent of non-disabled people.</p><p>Next is housing. Households with a disabled person, or a person with a long-term illness, are more likely to rent accommodation than they are to own their own home.</p><p>The last is education. A total of 58 per cent of disabled people, with or without a long-term illness, have no qualifications, compared with 24 per cent of non-disabled people.</p><p>On top of all that, one in five disabled Scots has experienced harassment at some time or other because of their impairment.</p><p>Poverty is a real issue for disabled people. The benefits system is a reserved matter but areas such as community care assessment and direct payments are within the powers of this Parliament. We can address them. We must have a comprehensive review of the assessment process, and greater emphasis must be placed on self-assessment in community care.</p><p>Direct payments go some way towards increasing social inclusion, which is obviously welcome. However, the take-up rate is quite low, especially among those with learning difficulties and mental health issues. From constituency cases, I have experienced at first hand just how difficult it is for people from certain areas to get their local authority to fund community care packages that are tailored to their needs&#8212;I am sure that many other members will have <place-holder colnum=\"16893\"/> experienced that, too. We must look into that if we really want to give people the choice of living independently rather than being in residential care. The issue is raised with me continually in my constituency office and in letters.</p><p>Transport has figured highly in the Equal Opportunities Committee's investigation and also features in the \"Manifesto for Inclusion\". Although we all appreciate the moves towards integrated transport services, disabled people still face various difficulties. Without access to services, people are excluded from participating in activities that most people would consider to be normal. We welcome the concessionary fares scheme that is being rolled out across the country but, when we read the legislation, we discover that the scheme will not be fully implemented until 2016 or 2017. People will have a concessionary card to travel, but the transport might not be available because it does not have to be in place until 2016 or 2017. The latest date for implementation&#8212;2020&#8212;seems quite far away, as is highlighted in the manifesto. It would be advantageous if the Scottish Parliament could set a date for implementation that is well ahead of the designated timescale. I leave that in the hands of the minister and suggest that she could address the issue when she responds.</p><p>Of all the services, access to meaningful education is one of the most important. Education can open doors to employment, lift people out of poverty and lead to a fulfilling life. However, we hear over and over again&#8212;not only in the evidence that has been given to our inquiry but in the manifesto&#8212;that disabled people are being let down by our further education colleges. They are sent on courses that do not benefit them. Young adults and others are being given colouring books and are being told to clean windows and given other tasks that do not lead to fulfilment or qualifications. During our inquiry, we heard of one young woman who was told to clean the classroom. Rightly, she said, \"No. I am here to get a qualification.\" That sort of thing is happening everywhere and we must examine it further.</p><p>This morning, we had a debate on further education and I hope that the needs of disabled people will be considered closely by the Minister for Education and Young People.

We must do something about cancelling the debt. After all, as Donald Gorrie pointed out, these countries have had to privatise their public sector industries so that outside firms will come in.

I agree that there must not be a knee-jerk reaction to this tragic case, but it is difficult not to be emotional when the life of a two-year-old child has been lost. I completely understand the anger and frustration of Andrew Morton's family.</p><p>I welcome the amnesty that has been introduced by the Minister for Justice, which has already seen a number of air-guns handed in. However, 55 out of an estimated 0.5 million is only 0.1 per cent. We must do much more to prevent another tragedy from happening. That is why we need to consider introducing an all-encompassing registration system, which would deal with what some see as an unfortunate macho culture in Scotland.</p><p>On the Tory and Labour amendments, I recognise that there has been a tightening of legislation at Westminster, but one-size-fits-all legislation cannot possibly work for the type of firearms that can be obtained in Scotland. Recent <place-holder colnum=\"15685\"/> legislation has raised the age at which people can acquire firearms, but let us not forget that the age of the alleged perpetrator of the crime against Andrew Morton was well above any limit that has been set. The minister and Jeremy Purvis mentioned the dangers of Scotland having different legislation from England but if Scotland needs separate and different legislation, surely it is our duty as a Parliament to realise that and introduce it.</p><p>We must realise that as air-guns get older, they become much more dangerous. Their springs become worn and the guns become more dangerous and powerful. In fact, some are as powerful as 0.22 rifles. We must get it across to people that air-guns are not toys but lethal weapons. Perhaps an educational campaign would make people aware of that.</p><p>The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland believes that there are 500,000 air-guns in Scotland, but we need to know exactly how many are in circulation. We also need to know about the weapons that are involved in incidents. At the moment, we are working on 2003 figures, but that is not good enough. We need updated figures.</p><p>Other issues have to be examined. We have to look at current legislation and stop the indiscriminate sale of air-guns, as Kenny MacAskill said. Members have only to walk through the streets of Glasgow and up to the Barras, as I do most Sundays, and they will see big, powerful air-guns&#8212;huge things that look like rifles&#8212;for sale in shop windows. Legislation must be introduced to ensure that such weapons cannot be bought over the counter. Firearms should be kept under lock and key and be open to inspection by officers at any time, so the legislation should also ensure that the main key holders are registered with the police, as Bruce McFee said.</p><p>In conclusion, our motion calls for powers over firearms to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament in view of tragic happenings, not just recently, but in the past. The Parliament should agree on that. We have to get the police, community groups, the Parliament and other interested parties round the table to discuss the way forward on regulating the use of these lethal and dangerous weapons, which, in the wrong hands, can have grave consequences.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Firearms Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I declare an interest, as my husband is a partner in a pest control firm and as such is subject to legislation on the control of firearms.

We should not simply step aside from the committee's recommendations.</p><p>When we took evidence from the Minister for Communities at stage 1, we put it to him that the committee had worked hard on the issue in a non-party political fashion. I believe that our recommendations, which were agreed by all committee members, are in the best interests of women who have come to this country from other parts of the UK and from throughout the world. That is why I ask the minister to take the recommendations on board. The SNP will support the bill at stage 1, but we reserve the right to amend the bill at stage 2 if amendments are not forthcoming from the Executive.</p><p>Female genital mutilation is just as it sounds. It is not, as it was previously widely known, female circumcision. FGM is the deliberate mutilation of the external female genitalia, comprising all procedures that involve the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia.</p><p>The health consequences of FGM can be life threatening, both immediately and in the long term. For example, the immediate effects include severe pain, shock and bleeding, fatal haemorrhaging, prolonged bleeding that can lead to anaemia and septicaemia which can result from use&#8212;which the minister cited&#8212;of unsterilised cutting equipment. The long-term health consequences include cysts, abscesses, urinary tract infections, chronic pelvic infections that can lead to infertility, painful sexual intercourse and complications during pregnancy and childbirth. For a woman, all those effects can have psychological consequences, including anxiety, depression, negative feelings, low self-esteem, poor self-identity and suppressed feelings of anger and betrayal. All those conditions have been, and are, experienced by women who have undergone female genital mutilation.</p><p>I ask that any press coverage of the issue refers to the practice as \"female genital mutilation\". At one committee meeting, we were told not by the committee clerks but by a television company that we could not talk about female genital mutilation because it did not like the term. I am sorry, but that is what it is and that is what we shall call it.<place-holder colnum=\"15035\"/></p><p>Although we should use the term female genital mutilation, we must be careful with the other language that we use on this matter and we must realise that, in certain cultures, the parents believe that they are acting in their daughters' best interests. However abhorrent the practice appears to be&#8212;it is absolutely abhorrent&#8212;we must use the proposed legislation not only to stamp it out but to educate the people of those communities and protect the girls who might be subjected to the practice in all its forms. We do not want to drive the practice underground. The matter must be out in the open, which is why many of the committee's recommendations on education and other issues are so necessary. I know that my fellow committee members will cover specific aspects of the bill, but I shall do my best to provide an overview.</p><p>Because of FGM's immediate and long-term effects, it is extremely important to include in the bill the World Health Organisation's entire classification system, which divides FGM into four classes, as a reference point to specify procedures that will be unlawful under the proposed legislation. We must also ensure that communities are adequately informed about any guidance, education and training. In that respect, the minister mentioned the Somali women's action group in Glasgow. I know that Elaine Smith will speak of her experiences with that group.</p><p>We must ensure that communities and individuals are aware of the various agencies and organisations that have the expertise to advise and help without stigmatising the people in question. Although I welcome the minister's assurance that the Executive will look at other publications and materials that are available in the UK and abroad, I ask that she take on board the point that was made by the Somali women's action group and other organisations that it is not always possible to put the spoken word into a leaflet; the information must be available in other forms. For example, visual material could be made available or someone in the community could speak to women on the matter. Moreover, suitable resources must be made available to the communities. The Executive has not yet said whether it will make those resources available, but it must do so if it plans to push the legislation out.</p><p>We must also remember that men are sometimes the heads of the communities and that we must educate them as well as the women by reminding them that FGM is not an essential cultural element that must be preserved. Our society and Parliament must bring the matter to the fore.</p><p>One issue that emerged from our evidence taking was that health professionals must be aware of FGM. Comfort Momoh, who is an FGM-specialist midwife, has based an excellent booklet <place-holder colnum=\"15036\"/> on research that she conducted into the subject in London. Some of her findings are very disturbing: for example, some health professionals said that FGM was not a big problem in their area and some midwives and doctors made comments such as \"I've been working in this hospital for the past 20 years and I've only seen two cases of FGM\".</p><p>That evidence is backed up by personal experience of members of the Somali women's action group. For example, one of its members in Glasgow was fortunate to survive the birth of her baby in very difficult and dangerous conditions. She needed two operations. The first, which was meant to undo the FGM, failed and she had to undergo a caesarean section to give birth. Furthermore, two pregnant women were automatically given caesareans because the doctors were totally unfamiliar with FGM procedures and practices. We must ensure that health professionals are educated on the matter. As those women go through horrific and traumatic experiences, education, awareness raising and on-going support must be provided to all professionals who come into contact with women who have suffered FGM.</p><p>The minister touched on asylum seekers, who were mentioned both by committee members and by groups that gave evidence. Although I accept the minister's comment that the proposed legislation will create extraterritorial offences that will prevent UK nationals in permanent UK residence from being taken abroad to have FGM performed on them, it will do nothing for the kids of asylum seekers. For example, Councillor Irene Graham of Glasgow City Council has done a lot of work on this matter. She says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We cannot assume that children will never be taken out of the country by any other family or community member. We are concerned that the bill should contain additional protection.\"</p><p>The minister has described the steps that she will take, but they do not go far enough. Something should be done to extend the provisions of the bill to provide further protection for the children of asylum seekers, should they be taken from Scotland. I hear what the minister is saying and the assurances that she has given, but we have to consider that particular aspect as well.</p><p>I cannot see the clock but I think that I have time to wind up.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13335222", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the minister for picking up on and answering some of the questions that I had.

As such, it cannot and should not be tolerated in any way, shape or form in this or any other country. We welcome the Executive's on-going commitment to anti-racism and particularly its continuing strategies, which the Scottish National Party whole-heartedly supports. We acknowledge the good work that is being done, especially in the one Scotland, many cultures campaign, which the minister mentioned. However, concerns still exist about the increase in racist crimes, which increased from 2,705 in 2001-02 to 3,787 in 2003-04. That increase might be due to more people reporting such crimes; if it is, we should welcome people recognising that racism is a crime that they should report. However, a University of Strathclyde report suggests that the figure could be five times higher than the figure of almost 4,000, which is worrying and must be examined. We must consider doing more research into aspects of the problem. The report clearly shows that, unfortunately, we have much more work to do in Scotland to eradicate racism.</p><p>The minister mentioned the race equality annual report. Keeping that report fully updated and monitored is important in ensuring that we can see the statistics for racist crimes that are committed. It is also important to consider mainstreaming&#8212;which the minister also mentioned&#8212;in the health service and in posts elsewhere. We should consider mainstreaming of equality and ensure <place-holder colnum=\"14532\"/> that it is fully implemented at all levels.</p><p>Parliament is committed to eradicating racism in Scotland, but I have grave concerns about some aspects of the media, which it is important to discuss.

We must recognise that democracy and freedom of speech are paramount, but we must also tell the media that with freedoms come responsibilities and that they should be responsible in their reporting.</p><p>The fresh talent initiative has been mentioned a lot. I note that the Conservative amendment would remove the reference to the initiative from the motion; it will be interesting to hear why when Mary Scanlon speaks to her amendment.

I fully support the initiative and intend to continue doing so, but perhaps the minister will give us some clarification during his summing-up.</p><p>Like everyone else, I have read the report. The gist of it is that we need the initiative because we have a falling population. In the First Minister's statement to Parliament on 25 February 2004, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our first target must be to avoid our population falling below 5 million. To do that, we need an additional 8,000 people living in Scotland each year between now and 2009.\"</p><p>He said that the way to do that was</p><p class=\"indent\">\"by retaining home-grown talent within Scotland; by encouraging Scots who have moved away to come back home; and by attracting some who are completely new to Scotland&#8212;from the rest of the United Kingdom, from the European Union and from further afield.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2004-02-25.5940.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 25 February 2004; c 5941.]</citation></p><p>I take it that that is why the fresh talent initiative has been mentioned in the motion.</p><p>We must remind ourselves that if we want to attract people from overseas who have never been to Scotland before, it is essential that when they come here, either as visitors or to settle, they do not experience racism and discrimination.

I congratulate Wendy Alexander on securing the debate. I repeat her tribute to Bill Butler for securing the previous debate on the subject and I congratulate him on the hard work that he has put into ending the scourge of racism.</p><p>I could probably call myself an adopted buddie, because I lived in Paisley for more than 20 years and took my kids along to St Mirren football ground. Unlike Wendy Alexander, however, I did not get the chance to go to Braehead. I used to go on the supporters' bus and I would see such fabulous places as Dundee and Perth, when I could get away from the game to go shopping. When Gordon McQueen was signed up by St Mirren no one could tear me away from the terraces, so members will know for exactly how long I used to go along to matches. I was a very keen supporter.</p><p>I congratulate St Mirren on its achievements. The club is the subject of a debate in Parliament and not only did it sign up to the UEFA 10-point plan but it implemented the plan, as Wendy Alexander said. The club should receive the highest accolade for doing that. Many football clubs, such as Dundee Football Club, have taken action. However, other clubs that said that they would sign up to the plan did not go ahead and do anything positive about it. I hope that such clubs will follow St Mirren's good lead and implement UEFA's fantastic 10-point plan, which is unique in the football world in that it operates throughout <place-holder colnum=\"13931\"/> Europe, not just in Scotland. If we can encourage every club in Europe to get rid of the scourge of racism, we will be closer to achieving a better society.</p><p>I thank Donald Gorrie for his tenacity in highlighting the issues of racism and sectarianism. I thank the Executive for taking the issue so seriously that we have been able to debate it not just in this members' business debate but in committees and in other debates in Parliament. I think that one of the Parliament's justice committees is considering the matter and I hope that offences will lead to prison sentences. As Bill Butler said, judges are sometimes too lenient in sentencing. We must take the matter seriously and get rid of the scourge of racism, for kids now and in the future.</p><p>We say that education about racism and sectarianism counts. The best education is achieved when people take part in something. It is much easier for people to learn the lessons when they take part in football as spectators or players. We need legislation that deals with people who go against what society wants, but others must learn to say that such behaviour is not acceptable. St Mirren can say, \"Okay, we might not be at the top of the football league, but we are the top of the league when it comes to doing something to help society.\" I commend St Mirren for its approach and I hope that other clubs and the public will listen to St Mirren and learn from its example.</p><p>Bill Butler mentioned schools. He and I&#8212;and others&#8212;attended a school meeting. Everyone there was from Glasgow and when we were asked what team we supported, we all said that we supported Partick Thistle. The kids' response was, \"Oh, right&#8212;Partick Thistle.\" It is important to get the message across that we are not just here to be legislators; we are willing to listen to kids in school and tell them that we are doing something to tackle racism and sectarianism.</p><p>Again, I thank Wendy Alexander for allowing me the opportunity to take part in this debate and I congratulate St Mirren Football Club.

I raised them because she failed to refer to them in her speech. She said that she was unable to mention them, but the Executive should take them on board.</p><p>I congratulate the Parliament on the free central heating programme. As John Swinburne said, it has made a difference to a large number of Scottish pensioners. However, as members from all parties except the Executive parties have said, it cannot be right that 2,500 of 2,900 winter deaths each year involve people who are more than 65 years of age. We know from stats that people die because they cannot afford to turn on their central heating. One in three respondents to a recent NOP poll carried out in Scotland indicated that they could not turn on their heating because they could not afford it. Seventy-two per cent had not even heard of a Government programme that could provide them with heating improvements. The Parliament should take up that issue. I am sure that members will agree that it falls within the scope of the Parliament.</p><p>Fuel poverty and winter deaths may increase dramatically, because gas and electricity prices have increased so substantially&#8212;in some cases, by 10 per cent or more. However, Communities Scotland, which is a Scottish Executive agency, says that even a 5 per cent increase would leave an additional 30,000 households in fuel poverty. When I put a question to the Executive or the Executive makes a speech on this issue, the <place-holder colnum=\"13884\"/> minister raises her hands and says, \"What can we do? We can do nothing, because it is a reserved matter.\" For the people who suffer from fuel poverty, it is not reserved. Paul Martin and other members, particularly those from the unionist parties, talk about what we can do in the Parliament. Paul said about three times that he would take direct action. I ask him and other members why they do not take direct action by supporting our amendment, which calls for the Parliament to have more powers. I hope that they will look to their conscience, support our amendment and at least think about supporting independence for the Parliament and a better life for our pensioners.</p><p>I recognise that some good things have been done. However, it is not enough to talk about what elderly people can do for the voluntary sector, what the voluntary sector can do for them and how good it is to have free transport and smart cards. Local councils up and down the country talk about those matters all the time&#8212;I talked about them when I was a councillor. However, we are a Parliament, not a local council, and we should have the powers of a normal Parliament to improve the lives of our people. We could talk about those subjects all the time, but we should let the councils speak about transport, for example. This is a Parliament and rather than talk about free transport, we should have the powers to look at tax issues and benefits and to improve the lives of our elderly people. Although free transport is a great thing, I ask members to remember that the Welsh Assembly introduced such a scheme and it does not have the powers of this so-called Parliament.</p><p>I ask members to think about this: we need more powers for this Parliament. That would enable us to introduce a citizen's pension to give people dignity in their old age and would allow them a decent pension so that they could put on their heating. That is an SNP idea; other parties might have other ideas, but they are only tinkering around the edges of the problem. Unless we have the powers of an independent Parliament, elderly people will still live in abject poverty. Poverty is the main cause of premature deaths in Scotland and unless we have our own powers in our own Parliament, we can do nothing about it.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13332036", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Older People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I understood that the minister was saying that she was sorry that she did not mention the issues that I have raised.

People think that eco-schools relate only to environmental issues, but that is not the case. I am glad that Cathie Craigie and John Swinney explained the other aspects; it is good to be able to say exactly what eco-schools are. Although in my area of <place-holder colnum=\"13669\"/> Glasgow we have inner-city schools, we can create a green lung through schools, with planting and so on. Through the eco-schools scheme, schools can speak to and become involved in the community.</p><p>St Peter's Primary School in Partick, which is part of the constituency that I represent, produced a report about the benefits of the eco-schools scheme. The report says that the children have increased self-confidence and discuss in public, and with the public, issues that are important to them, something that we in Scotland have been sadly lacking over the years, according to the report. The children develop a greater awareness of the community and learn how to fit into their environment and how their actions impact on other people&#8212;that is important in relation to good citizenship as well. They also learn where Scotland stands in relation to other countries and how we all need to help other countries to develop, particularly after disasters and wars.</p><p>The children are encouraged to co-operate with other schools in the community. In the Partick area, St Peter's Primary School and Kelvinhaugh Primary School have worked together on gardening projects, which encourages friendship between the schools. The children are excited about getting involved with the Clyde River Foundation. Along with the University of Glasgow, St Peter's is raising brown trout from eggs, to release the fish into the wild. That teaches the kids exactly how the animal kingdom works. The River Kelvin is now sufficiently cleaned up that brown trout can be released into it; the trout will be monitored until they reach maturity.</p><p>The teachers have reported on the children's self-confidence, teamwork and ability to listen to others and care about what happens around them. For me, that is what eco-schools are about&#8212;caring for not just the environment but one another. The scheme promotes good citizenship.</p><p>Members have talked about funding.

The Lib-Lab Executive supported Greater Glasgow NHS Board's proposals to close hospitals, but the board suddenly made a miraculous U-turn and decided to keep the accident and emergency units open at Stobhill hospital and the Victoria infirmary. The SNP welcomes that, as do the people of Glasgow, who fought hard, long and weary to make the board and the Executive see sense and acknowledge that we cannot do without those units. That is why we are having this debate.</p><p>There is another reason for the debate. Lo and behold, a little thing called a general election is just around the corner. I wonder whether the fact that there will be a general election in May has something to do with that miraculous U-turn. I challenge the minister to guarantee in his summing up that the units that have just had a <place-holder colnum=\"12924\"/> reprieve at Stobhill hospital and the Victoria infirmary will stay open long after May 2005. Will the minister put his money where his mouth is and give us that guarantee?</p><p>As I said, NHS Greater Glasgow said that the units must be closed, but then gave the hospitals a miraculous reprieve. The facility at the Victoria infirmary was supposed to be replaced by a day centre in 2007. Indeed, in the summer the board said that the process would have to be speeded up because of a chronic lack of staff. Also in the summer, Robert Calderwood, the chief executive of the south Glasgow division of the health board said that the closure of the unit at Stobhill hospital was imminent because of a chronic lack of staff.</p><p>I am pleased that the units will now stay open, but as I said, Glasgow has some of the worst waiting times in the UK. Where will we find the staff to work in the units? Shona Robison was right to say that we should be trying to recruit people from abroad, instead of privatising the health service. The public were right all along; we need those hospitals to stay open, with enough staff to be able to reduce waiting times in the Glasgow area. Will the minister tell us in his summing up how he will ensure that there are staff to work in the units and how he will ensure that staff are not hived off to the private sector?</p><p>One of the Labour members said that this is not privatisation and that we are not looking to any other country. I put it to the minister, however, that the proposals mirror what is happening in England, where some health professionals are worried that hospitals might have to close because they will be so unpopular that people will not work in them. That is exactly what is happening now&#8212;it is privatisation by the back door.</p><p>Duncan McNeil, Des McNulty and all the other Labour members stand there and say, \"People don't care how they get their treatment as long as they get it quickly.\" Fair enough; people want treatment within the recommend timescale, but perhaps those members should get out and speak to their constituents about the matter. They can believe it or not, but their constituents have consciences and do not want the NHS to be privatised. It is true that they want treatment quickly, but they want that treatment kept within the NHS because they care about people. They do not want the health service to be privatised and it is about time that the Labour members learned that.</p><p>I will outline the reality of what is happening in the health service right now. A constituent of mine who has had a mastectomy was told that she had to have a check-up in September 2003. However, she was then told that she could not get that check-up until December 2003 because there were insufficient staff. That appointment was put <place-holder colnum=\"12925\"/> back again and she was told that she should have the check-up in September 2004. Now, however, she has been told that she will get her appointment in February 2005. That is the reality of the situation that faces the people in our constituencies. Labour members should listen to their consciences and believe what those people tell them. Privatisation of the health service will not help those people.</p><p>I ask the minister, where will the staff come from?

Some Tory, Lib Dem and Labour members probably take Tony Blair's word for it, but before they condemn anyone, they should look at the letter that was signed by dignitaries, Helena Kennedy QC and a Lib Dem peer, Lord Garden. That letter asks Tony Blair to instigate an investigation into the many civilian deaths in Iraq and I ask members to support that. Alex Salmond of the SNP has tabled an early-day <place-holder colnum=\"12755\"/> motion to call for an investigation and Tony Blair has said that we do not need an investigation. How can we trust someone who will not investigate what <em>The Lancet</em> says are 100,000 deaths? Members should think on that when they vote tonight.</p><p>The deaths in Iraq have occurred. People have said that we should not go over the past, but we must do that so that we know where we will go in future. As I said, we know that no weapons of mass destruction existed. We were told lies and international law was flouted. We must do and say something before Tony Blair and George Bush embark on another war in what Bush calls \"the axis of evil\". Which other countries will be involved in that war? He has also named Cuba as being in the so-called axis of evil. Instead of creating a more peaceful world, a much more dangerous world will be created if Bush and Blair get away with what they want to get away with.</p><p>There must be an international peacekeeping force in Iraq that is respected by the Iraqi people. Unfortunately, the actions of Bush and Blair have led to disrespect for the west and to Iraq being a dangerous place for our soldiers, as other members have said. Members should support Alex Neil's amendment. Something must be done. We must stop the killing in Iraq in the name of humanity and of God.</p>", "hdate": "2004-12-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13329120", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Iraq"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry; the time for my speech has been reduced to five minutes and others want to speak.

As Donald Gorrie said, it is easier to be the convener than to be the treasurer, and Donald, as vice-convener, gives us lots of help, as does Nanette Milne. Every time we have a cross-party group meeting, it is amazing to hear how much work people from all over Scotland have done. They come along to the cross-party group and tell us exactly what they have been doing throughout the country. As Rosie Kane said, they help not only by going for prescriptions but by being involved in the Scottish Trades Union Congress pensioners forum. Some of them are 80 years old and they still continue to go along to meetings and to bring their expertise to our cross-party group.</p><p>This is perhaps a good time to make a little plug for the cross-party group's conference on Saturday, when people from all over Scotland will come along to the Parliament for the very first cross-party group conference. If it was not for the energy and support of those older people, the event would never have got off the ground, and I am proud and pleased to be involved in it.</p><p>Mention has been made of the attributes that elderly people bring. John Swinburne has mentioned the skills that elderly people have, and one thing that comes with those skills is older people's reliability, which we tend to forget about. We often take for granted their ability to ensure that they are somewhere at an appointed time and carry out a task. Throughout the years on the cross-party group I have noticed that if it was not for the reliability of those people, we would be going nowhere.</p><p>I am pleased that Sarah Boyack mentioned in her speech that this is not a touchy-feely debate. I have concerns and other members have expressed concerns, too. Karen Whitefield mentioned insurance cover, which is of great concern to many voluntary groups. Often, insurance companies will not give voluntary groups insurance cover for over-70s. I know that <place-holder colnum=\"12718\"/> the matter is reserved, but I would like to think that members of the Executive would consider what they can do about the fact that people cannot get insurance cover and would take up the issue with their Westminster colleagues. As Christine Grahame rightly said, there are many sprightly over-70s&#8212;they are probably sprightlier than I am&#8212;who would love to volunteer for certain groups but cannot get the insurance cover. I would like the minister to take that matter up.</p><p>Another matter of concern is the volunteering strategy, which we discussed a few months ago. I spoke in that debate and I have the volunteering strategy in front of me. One of the matters that I raised with members of the cross-party group is the fact that the volunteering strategy does not include a strategy for elderly people who volunteer. Again, I ask the minister whether we will follow the Welsh example and have a strategy that is specifically for elderly people. It is right that we raise such concerns in this debate.</p><p>Another concern of mine is that Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has announced that 2005 will be the year of the volunteer. I have submitted these questions as written questions. If the minister has further information, I ask him to let us know which voluntary sector organisations in Scotland will be involved in the year of the volunteer that the chancellor has announced and how much money they might get to take forward their work.</p><p>I congratulate Sarah Boyack and all the other members who have spoken. I do not think that Scotland or even the world could go round without the work that is done by elderly volunteers. Members all meet such volunteers daily. Parts of the economy would collapse if they did not contribute in such numbers.</p><p>I say good luck to them, on my behalf and, I assume, on behalf of other members.

If the minister will let me finish this time, I will also point out that COSLA, which represents all local authorities, has stated that the majority of council leaders are opposed to any reduction, including the leaders of the authorities served by the three brigades that the minister mentioned.</p><p>Paragraph 23 of the report states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the Minister advised that the immediate driver behind the proposal to reduce the number of control rooms\"</p><p>was funding. So it is all about money. The Scottish National Party acknowledges that funding is important but believes that it should not compromise people's safety and ultimately their lives. I ask the minister to consider that point as well.</p><p>Before I move on, I want to make it clear that my rural colleagues will consider the important issue of the geography of those areas, so I will not dwell on that in my speech. However, although I accept what the minister said on that matter, I should point out that people in those areas are very concerned about the reorganisation of the fire boards. If that reorganisation goes ahead, it might lead to an increase in injuries and deaths. In response to Bill Butler, the minister said that the matter will come before Parliament, and I look <place-holder colnum=\"12004\"/> forward to hearing what the minister has to say on that.</p><p>On the issue of employment, Maureen Macmillan mentioned that one area of concern was section 45, which basically refers to the rights of trade unions. Maureen said that she accepted the minister's explanation, but I cannot take any comfort from his comments. For example, he said that, although the phrase \"recognised trade unions\" did not present any difficulties for him, he could not include it in the bill. I would have thought that, given his previous life, the minister, of all people, would recognise trade unions and I ask him to explain why he cannot use that term.</p><p>Section 45 gives ministers the power to establish a \"statutory negotiating body\" that will be made up of representatives of employers and employees. Why can it not mention trade unions? I ask the minister to reconsider the matter; after all, we know that it is usually trade unions that represent employees&#8212;it is similar to Mike Pringle's point in his speech that a policeman is a policeman is a policeman. I cannot see where the difficulty lies. In any case, the rights of trade unions are enshrined in the European convention on human rights and I believe that they must be given legitimacy in the bill. If that does not happen, the unions and I will regard such an approach as an absolute farce.</p><p>Maureen Macmillan also raised concerns about the bill's approach to fire safety duties and industrial action. Although the report makes it clear that the minister has given assurances on this matter, I seek clarification on section 67. A civil offence is already set out in section 240 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which stipulates the requirements of those who take part in lawful industrial action. However, section 67(2) of the bill would make it a criminal offence for individuals to take part in lawful industrial action. I emphasise the word \"individuals\", because it does not matter whether we are talking about firefighters, fire control operators or any other individual who is deemed to have a responsibility for fire safety in their workplace. Again, I know that the report says that the minister has already given assurances on this issue, but I seek his assurances about the intention behind section 67(2) and ask him to clarify categorically either through an intervention or in his summing-up that he does not intend to make it a criminal offence for a person to strike.</p><p>I thank the members of my party for giving me this opportunity to speak this morning. I am not a member of the Justice 2 Committee, but I have certainly read the report and the other evidence. Strathclyde fire brigade is one of the biggest brigades in the country&#8212;indeed, it is one of the three fire authorities that the minister said were in <place-holder colnum=\"12005\"/> favour of reducing the number of control rooms to three. However, that brigade and the members of the FBU are very concerned about all their colleagues throughout Scotland and would urge the minister and the Parliament to examine carefully the bill's contentious bits and pieces such as the reduction in the number of control rooms and aspects that relate to trade unions and industrial action. I cannot support the whole bill without examining those issues.</p><p>I could highlight the many and varied incidents in which the men and women in the fire brigades have given their all&#8212;members have already mentioned Lockerbie and the Maryhill tragedy&#8212;but I will not dwell on individual actions. All I will say is that those people would not be telling us that there is something wrong with the bill and that we should look at it properly if there were no reason to do so. I am asking the Parliament not to simply take on board the minister's assurances. That said, if he can give us some assurances on the questions that I have raised, that might go some way towards allowing the SNP to support the bill.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327331", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fire (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was just about to say that the three fire brigades or authorities that indicated that three control rooms would be their preferred option represent 23 local authorities.

Recently, I mentioned in a question to the minister&#8212;I think that it was around two weeks ago&#8212;that there is only one refuge for elderly people, and elderly women in particular, in Scotland. Surely that is unacceptable. I know that the minister replied and basically said that Scottish Women's Aid and other agencies would look into the matter, but we must take serious cognisance to the problem. Some women have suffered abuse for decades and have worked up the courage to recognise that fact and to seek help. When they do so, there is nowhere for them to go. We should pay particular attention to that matter and ensure that it has been dealt with. I know that the Tayside domestic abuse service has a good and effective strategy, which my colleague, Andrew Welsh, will talk about.</p><p>I return to the Executive's motion and the extra funding for children and young people, which I mentioned. I ask the minister to announce as soon as possible where and when the money will be allocated. It is crucial that agencies such as Scottish Women's Aid and others know the level of <place-holder colnum=\"11604\"/> funding that they will receive. Even more important, they need to know that the funding is long term and secure&#8212;that is why our amendment specifically mentions that matter. Lack of long-term funding severely hampers the ability of agencies to provide services that are essential for the protection of the thousands of women and children who seek help. It is unacceptable that funding for Scottish Women's Aid is for only one year in some areas. I accept what the minister has said about examining that issue. Sometimes the level of help depends on the area in which someone lives, which is why the Scottish National Party has consistently called for a national funding strategy. We support Shiona Baird's amendment, as it specifically mentions a national strategy.</p><p>Domestic violence is a crime and should be treated as such.

I know that she has worked hard on the matter over the past two or three years. Before I start, I apologise for the fact that I have to be at a meeting in Glasgow later and will have to get a taxi at 6 o'clock.</p><p>I echo everything that other members have said about the advantages to be gained from working in the construction industry. Much has been said about the benefits to Scotland's economy, which is absolutely correct, but it is important to remember the benefit that people get from the feeling that they have real and lasting employment. The skills and training that people in the sector receive have been overlooked for far too long by Government and education authorities, who appear to have thought of the sector as being beneath them. I am glad that the skills involved in the construction industry are being recognised. I pay tribute to Alex Neil, Marilyn Livingstone and everyone in the industry who has pushed hard not to glamorise the industry but to ensure that it is an industry that young people&#8212;and even old people, as John Swinburne suggested&#8212;might want to become involved in.</p><p>Marilyn Livingstone and Christine May have spoken about ethnic minorities and women. I <place-holder colnum=\"11406\"/> agree that it is crucial that we encourage more ethnic minorities and women into the industry. There must be a better gender balance in the industry. It is true that more women have been entering the industry but not enough have done so. We should be trying to ensure that schools assist in that. I know that some schools have day-visit schemes, apprenticeship schemes and that type of thing. The fact that we do not have a gender balance in the construction industry causes me great concern.</p><p>Another area of concern that all the members who have spoken have raised are the rogue traders in the industry. I believe that, in 2002, the Construction Licensing Executive was created to restore confidence to the consumer and make regulation of the industry easier.</p><p>Another on-going area of concern relates to accidents at work. From speaking to Sid Patten&#8212;I am sorry to hear that he is ill&#8212;and others, I gather that health and safety measures are being examined in collaboration with Glasgow Caledonian University. Perhaps the minister could give us an update on that. The study is examining how factors such as climate, daylight hours and so on affect accidents in the industry.</p><p>The security industry as it relates to the construction industry is another area of concern. I have written to the Minister for Justice on many occasions to ask when we are going to regulate the security industry in Scotland. The answer that I have had back is basically that we will have to wait until the Queen's speech, which I think is on 3 November, to find out whether the matter will be covered in United Kingdom legislation on the security industry. I have written and have not found out whether the matter will be included in the Queen's speech. I ask the minister whether he can give us an update on that. If the matter will not be included in the Queen's speech, could we please have security industry legislation for Scotland? The problems in the security industry are bringing the construction industry into disrepute and bringing Scotland into disrepute. The firms are really fronts for drug runners and we need to examine the issue thoroughly. I ask Allan Wilson to take that point on board and perhaps pass it on to Cathy Jamieson if he cannot answer it.</p><p>The construction industry employs more than 132,000 people directly and is worth &#163;10 billion in sales and turnover. That is positive and the industry is on the up. It is up to the Parliament to ensure that we join the construction industry and give it the positive legislation that it deserves to enable it to move forward.

If we could get the Executive to make progress on that, it would go some way towards rewarding all the hard work that Remploy and other organisations have been doing. I hope that the minister will be able to give us some encouragement on that in his summing up.</p><p>Like Shiona Baird, I am a member of the Equal Opportunities Committee. In the evidence that we have taken, we have heard about the difficulties that people with disabilities face, not just in securing a job or education but in securing a normal life within society. I thoroughly agree with what Shiona Baird said about employees and the general public. She also mentioned attitudes, which were one of the main issues that I raised with the people who gave evidence to our committee. It was a consistent theme in the evidence that we took that overturning attitudes towards disabled people would be one of the most difficult hurdles that we would encounter. We must work towards that goal, because people are people, regardless of whether they have disabilities.</p><p>Someone who gave evidence to the committee said that even disabled people themselves sometimes have the attitude that they are disabled and are not deserving of a decent education or a decent job. We must put forward a positive message. That is why I congratulate Remploy on the highly positive message that it puts forward and the hard work that it does. Remploy helps people, regardless of their disability, by giving them a forward-thinking attitude towards their life, their education and their employment. It has worked hard at that.<place-holder colnum=\"11066\"/></p><p>Helen Eadie spoke about Remploy's work on developing skills. It is fantastic that it has training programmes in which it works with trade unions to get people through the learning process. It is not as if the trainers are put on board just to talk to the employees; they talk them through the skill training and learning and are always at the end of a phone or on the shop floor to answer any questions. That is excellent; there are not many employment agencies, even those that do not deal with disabilities, that provide such services.</p><p>Employment gives disabled people the scope to go out into the world and say, \"I am somebody. I am not disabled, because I am a person in my own right. I may have something different about me, but I am still a person and deserve the best chance and opportunities that I can possibly get.\" Remploy gives such people new skills and value through their training. We have heard about the washing machines and fridges that Remploy repairs, for example, but its work is much more than that, because it gives disabled people the opportunity to get up every morning, do a full day's work and feel good about themselves. We sometimes take that for granted, but the people whom Remploy supports think that it is fantastic. We must thank Remploy and similar organisations for doing that.</p><p>Helen Eadie mentioned employee development time&#8212;I think that 5 per cent of the working time is devoted to employee development&#8212;and the learning centres that Remploy has in every centre. How many workplaces can say that they have learning centres? Perhaps even the Parliament does not have a learning centre for our employees to further their careers, so in some ways Remploy is much more advanced than some other employers.</p><p>I congratulate Helen Eadie on her speech and I congratulate Remploy most of all. I ask the Executive to take on board the last clause of the motion, which calls for it to examine its procurement policy. That is important. If the minister says that the Executive will examine its procurement policy, the people from Remploy will go home happier.

For far too long in Scotland, in the United Kingdom as a whole and in other places throughout the world, women have been discriminated against just because of their gender. That situation cannot be tolerated and must be stopped as soon as possible.</p><p>I am sure that all members who are present know that the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970. Even so, 34 years later most women do not have equality. Although the legislation requires parity of payment, that is still not the case. Many firms have been informed of, and warned about, the discrimination legislation, but they do not comply with it.</p><p>PayFinder.com contacted me about the gender pay gap. It produced a paper that tells us that the gender pay gap now stands at 29 per cent. That compares with the UK average of 24 per cent, which is still bad. Given everything that has happened, it is ridiculous that the pay gap is wider than it was when the Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed.</p><p>We know that women make up the majority of workers in low-pay, low-value jobs and, because most women are the principal carers in the home, they take on part-time jobs, which are especially <place-holder colnum=\"10891\"/> badly paid. Sometimes working part time is the only option that such women have. That, coupled with inequality of pay, means that they get the sharp end of the stick. The situation will change for the better when the Government implements better education and child care. I hope that the Government will take over the provision of child care; that would be a good thing.</p><p>What can we say to women who have been through further education, who have good degrees, who have child care and who have a good job but who, at the end of the week, get less money than their male counterparts simply because they are women? Their gender counts against them. I believe that it is incumbent on the Executive to set a good example at all levels. I say in my motion that we should do something about the situation. The Executive should ensure that equal treatment is the norm throughout the Scottish Government. I ask it to instigate an audit of all the employees in the Government, regardless of which job they carry out, to find out whether fairness and equality are prominent.</p><p>I know that work has already been carried out on equal pay. Close the gap, a three-year campaign that was launched in 2001, received European funding. It began with the specific aims of enabling employees to carry out audits&#8212;as I have just suggested&#8212;of encouraging the development of action plans, of engaging unions in making equal pay a priority and, most important, of empowering women to challenge pay discrimination.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13324535", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gender Pay Gap"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps we do not just need equality of pay, but equality of manners, although that is for another debate on another day.

The legislators must do that&#8212;we must go forward.</p><p>As I said, the pay gap is even wider, even though surveys have been carried out. A 61,000 person survey was carried out by the University of Aberdeen and was prompted, believe it or not, by women in the media who are concerned about what is happening to them. Professor Rita Marcella of Aberdeen business school said of women in the media that<place-holder colnum=\"10892\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"evidence suggests that they are still failing to achieve equity with men in terms of entry, retention and progression.\"</p><p>Perhaps the media in the Scottish Parliament, and the women in particular, should do their own audit so that we can see what they come up with.</p><p>Alyson Thomson of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Scotland has said that the findings that have come out of the various surveys are not surprising and that still too many women are being treated as second-class citizens&#8212;that is straightforward discrimination. Basically, they are being paid less because they are women.</p><p>A report to the Justice 1 Committee by the National Association of Official Prison Visitors states that women prisoners get lower wages than male prisoners. How is that for discrimination? Even Gordon Brown, in his speech to the Brighton Labour Party conference, criticised 50 years of the welfare state for failing in respect of equal pay for women. Patricia Hewitt, another Labour politician, set up a commission on women in work to deal with equality and pay, and she says that women are rightly demanding a better deal at work. At Westminster and here in this Parliament, we seem to have cross-party support for some form of audit and some form of legislation to stop the inequalities that women face at the moment.</p><p>I mentioned pilot schemes such as the close the gap scheme. The Minister for Communities, Margaret Curran, set up a new equality group to report on putting ideas into practice. Unfortunately, that has not happened yet, and we must make it a requirement that it does happen. It is fine to commission reports, but we need action. Women need action and they need equality. We cannot, without taking any action, go on writing reports and asking women to fill in questionnaires about how unhappy they are or about what their work time is like. That is why I say that Parliament must make it a requirement to prioritise equal pay.</p><p>As Jeremy Purvis said&#8212;I am sure that other members will agree&#8212;we must set up audits to ensure that each company conforms to legislation. We can no longer leave it voluntary; we must initiate a legislative process. Only by being bold and forward thinking in tackling inequality will we be able to put an end to the deliberate discrimination that faces many working women.

The problem in the Glasgow area and throughout Scotland&#8212;from Inverness and Wick down to Glasgow and the Borders&#8212;is that the public have not been informed about what is going on. They have basically been told, \"That's it.\" I ask the minister what exactly is going to happen. Are the Queen mum's and Yorkhill going to have new hospitals built on the present sites, or are the hospitals to be moved to a brand-new site or a site at the Southern general? What are the minister's thoughts on that? I and colleagues from all parties have been speaking to the groups who have been working with us.

There is no rise.</p><p>Glasgow is the worst city in Scotland for poverty, so I would have thought that it was essential for more moneys to go into CABx. Parkhead CAB is to close for two days a week and Easterhouse CAB is to lose one worker. They contacted me to say that that will have a detrimental effect on their services. That is due to lack of funding. I hope that the minister will take that point on board.

If they do not do that&#8212;and CABx are saying that they cannot do that because it would breach confidentiality&#8212;the council has said that they will not get any new moneys or be able to access the money they get just now. A letter that I have states that MACS is the preferred system of the Scottish Executive. That is worrying.

I welcome the fast-track scheme; I have sent many questions on that scheme to the minister and I am pleased with his replies. Given the scheme's remit and timescale, it seems to be going well. However, given the current shortage of social workers, the fast-track scheme will not be sufficient to make up the loss of social workers. I would like a scheme to be put in place for workers in social work departments who do not have proper qualifications. Such a scheme could fast track those workers through the system to enable them to get qualifications without having to leave their jobs.</p><p>We need to find work-based routes into learning for people who are already in the sphere, rather than sending them back to university. They have experience on the ground, so to fast track them into getting qualifications is an excellent idea.

Most people are not aware that registration in social work is entirely different from the registration of nurses, teachers and occupational therapists.

In the areas where I and others work, it is not just white, middle-class people who volunteer.</p><p>We have to accept that there are difficulties&#8212;especially in disadvantaged areas and among young and elderly people&#8212;and that only about a quarter of charities can pay people's child-care and travel costs. Transport costs are especially important in rural areas. We must acknowledge that when we discuss resources and funding for charities, as one of the main reasons why they cannot encourage as many people as they would like to give of their time is the fact that people cannot afford it. That has been recognised in what most members, including the minister, have said.</p><p>The centrepiece of the volunteering strategy is project Scotland, which the minister and most other members have mentioned. I welcome that initiative. However, as the convener of the cross-party group on older people, age and aging, I question why there is no specific strategy or project for elderly people. I have just come from a meeting of the cross-party group, which asked me to mention that. We are not talking about people who are in their 90s or who are 100; we are talking about people who are aged 50 and over&#8212;which includes myself and other members who will admit to their ages&#8212;who give a great deal of their time and have a lot of expertise to offer.</p><p>When we consider the life experience of those people, and the fact that they want to continue getting life experience through education as well as volunteering, we do them a great disservice. Perhaps we should have a strategy specifically for them because, if we consider the facts, ours is an aging population, so why should we not produce a strategy and a project with those people in mind? I am sure that most of the charities and the cross-party group that I chair would be more than happy to give evidence on that or to work towards such a strategy for the minister. The group was very specific in asking me to raise the point in today's debate, so I ask the minister to consider the issue in conjunction with the other areas that I have mentioned.</p><p>I go back to project Scotland and the concerns I have about it. To answer Lord Watson's criticisms of some of the SNP's comments, I am not <place-holder colnum=\"9685\"/> criticising the minister, but I am concerned about some of the aspects of project Scotland; perhaps the minister could clarify some things for me.</p><p>The strategy mentions 16 to 25-year-olds and the gap between the transitional year and funding, which means that a volunteer gets three months-worth of moneys. How would that work if the young people were not in education? How would it work if they were receiving unemployment benefit or something like that?</p><p>The minister also goes on to mention that the Executive is hoping to get 1,000 volunteers and that the cost of setting that up in 2005 might be met from sponsorship. How will that work? Is the Executive going to fund it for a year and look for private sponsorship afterwards? I ask that because I believe that sometimes organisations suffer from a lack of funding three or four years after setting up, which is a problem. Perhaps the Executive will give project Scotland false hope by giving it money for one year when it might not be able to get sponsorship after that. That is not an attack; it is a point on which I am looking for clarification.</p>", "hdate": "2004-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20158478", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Volunteering"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "If Ted Brocklebank will let me finish, I will give way.

Graham Blount in particular has done a lot of work in the cross-party group on refugees and asylum seekers. He has travelled all over Scotland, trying to help refugees and asylum seekers with their plight.</p><p>I see asylum seekers on a daily basis in the Glasgow area, as I am sure does Johann Lamont. They are situated in Sighthill, Townhead and all over the city. I cannot get over the welcome that I receive whenever I go up to these people's houses, whether just to knock on their door to see whether they are okay or to follow up a query that they have phoned into the constituency office. I remember one occasion when two boys were offered trials with Partick Thistle, our great football club in Glasgow, but unfortunately they could not take up the offer, because they did not have the permits needed to stay here permanently.</p><p>I was invited into the home of that family, and was given an absolute feast. I could not quite believe how these people could put such a feast in front of me and others on the pittance that they receive from the Home Office. I have been given such a marvellous welcome in every house that I have gone to. I wish that the media&#8212;certain tabloid newspapers, anyway&#8212;could see how such asylum seekers welcome us into their homes. Perhaps then there would not be such negative coverage of asylum seekers and refugees in the media. If there are any representatives of the media in the chamber, I hope that they will take that lesson on board. The scaremongering has to stop. These people are welcome in our country, and we look forward to welcoming them here. The media should heed that message.</p><p>I have been speaking about asylum seekers who have accommodation, for which I must thank Glasgow City Council. Lots of councils come in for a bit of flak on that issue, but Glasgow City Council has gone overboard to try to help. In <place-holder colnum=\"9159\"/> particular, Mr O'Hara of the council's asylum seekers unit bends over backwards to help with any problems that asylum seekers have. Those asylum seekers who have a home are the lucky ones&#8212;if we can call them that. As might be the case in other areas&#8212;I know only about the Glasgow situation, because I have been so closely involved in it&#8212;asylum seekers are put out on the streets of Glasgow. They are destitute and have nowhere to go. All that they can be offered by the Simon Community and the various voluntary organisations that exist around Glasgow is, basically, a sleeping bag.</p><p>I have already spoken to Margaret Curran about the matter, and I appeal to the Deputy Minister for Communities to write to the Home Office or to speak to the relevant minister there&#8212;it is not Beverley Hughes now, but I cannot remember who it is; I am sure that the minister will remind me. We are not looking to the future at the moment. There are people here who have escaped persecution and who came to this country, expecting to be safe. They might not expect a marvellous welcome from people in this country, but they certainly get it, and despite that, they are thrown out on the streets. We have an army&#8212;near enough&#8212;of mainly young, single men, sleeping rough on our streets. Young women, aged perhaps 24 to 30, have now started coming to my surgeries, and some of them have been put out on the streets. We cannot condone that action, and the Home Office has to be made aware that we in the Scottish Parliament will not put up with it.</p><p>I appeal to anyone who will be in Glasgow on Saturday 19 June to get themselves along to the Glasgow Film Theatre to see \"Welcome\", a film by Camcorder Guerillas, narrated by Elaine C Smith, on the plight of asylum seekers who sleep rough on the streets. There will also be a question and answer session with asylum seekers and refugees, many of whom have degrees and are mathematicians, midwives or doctors but who cannot work and are put out on the streets. I appeal to members to take the opportunity to go along to the GFT on Saturday to see the film.</p><p>Some people in my area&#8212;particularly midwives&#8212;have been offered jobs and have letters from the school of nursing, midwifery and community health at Glasgow Caledonian University, but they cannot get work permits. In response to phone calls, the Home Office says that they are at the bottom of the pile, but some of them have been here for four years. We must do something about that.</p><p>Rosie Kane is quite right&#8212;we should not just say that people should come here because that is economically viable for our country; humanitarian concern states that we should bring people in.

I was going to mention that later in my speech. I spoke to Jean Turner earlier, who will raise that issue if she is called to speak. We now know that Stobhill hospital is to close two years before it was due to close, according to the minister's announcement. Tommy Sheridan makes a valid point in that respect.</p><p>I would like to mention some of the other issues in Glasgow. There has been lots of publicity about the closure of the Queen Mother's hospital and lots of angry voices&#8212;MSPs' voices and the public's voices&#8212;have been heard. It is the jewel in the crown of maternity services, not just for Glasgow but for Scotland, and it should be emulated throughout the world. I find it hard to believe that, even after the letters that I have sent him and the petitions that have been submitted, the minister has still not given us an answer as to whether the Queen Mum's will be saved. Staff morale there is very low indeed. It is imperative that the minister gives us an answer as soon as possible, to stop the drip-drip effect on morale.</p><p>Let us consider what the cost savings might be if the Queen Mum's were to close. The estimated cost saving is &#163;1.3 million. We are talking about Greater Glasgow NHS Board trying to save &#163;58.8 million. Closure of in-patient beds at the homeopathic hospital&#8212;which is also a world leader and one of only two such hospitals in Britain&#8212;will lead to estimated cost savings of &#163;300,000. That still does not make a big dent in the &#163;58.8 million. The health board has said that 1,000 jobs will be shed through natural wastage. I am certain that nobody would lose any sleep if the health board people lost their jobs&#8212;I put it to the minister that that would be genuine natural wastage. However, we do not know whether any of the health board people are going to lose their jobs. Why should it be front-line workers who lose their jobs?</p><p>We have now heard the grand announcement from Greater Glasgow NHS Board that it is going to charge patients and staff car-parking charges at all hospitals. It has said that there will be a consultation, but every one of us has seen how Greater Glasgow NHS Board conducts its <place-holder colnum=\"8454\"/> consultation processes. The board's press release states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is planned to introduce the charges on a phased basis from April 1 2005.\"</p><p>So now we know how the consultation process works in Glasgow.</p><p>New Labour members are the current guardians of the health service in Scotland. They are supposed to be the Government of this country, yet we see closures, staff losses and the drip-drip effect on staff morale. We are going to lose a lot of good staff who have come to do medical research but who feel as if they cannot move on because there is not enough money or a vision for the future of health services, not just in Glasgow but throughout Scotland. What we are really seeing is the centralisation of the health service. I ask the minister, or whoever is responsible, to look at the closures and stop any closures whatsoever until the expert group on NHS service change reports back to the Parliament. If that approach is not taken, it will be too late for the Queen Mum's and for other hospitals.

The debate is about stamping out racism in football but, as we all know, the tentacles of racism do not start and stop at football grounds. I take this opportunity to congratulate St Johnstone <place-holder colnum=\"8408\"/> Football Club, which has been mentioned already, on signing up to the UEFA 10-point plan. The Show Racism the Red Card campaign and the clubs that are taking part in it are to be applauded, but its aims would be enhanced if all Scottish clubs signed up to the UEFA plan. The abuse of a person just because they happen to be of a particular race should not and cannot be tolerated in modern Scotland. As Bill Butler said, a number of players from all over the continent come to Scotland to play for Scottish football clubs, and in a world that seems to be shrinking it is beyond belief that racism is still practised.</p><p>We see racism every day not only in football grounds but in the streets. Like other members, I have been involved in work with asylum seekers; I have seen racism affect them and their communities, which is a sad state of affairs. Unfortunately, in Glasgow in particular we hear racist chants and see racist drawings, paintings and graffiti, which sprout in certain areas in which asylum seekers congregate. Such incidents perhaps happen after people come out of football matches. We should hang our heads in shame about that. I hope that those who are involved in such racist abuse are caught and told that their deeds do nothing for Scotland as a whole. Their racist message is not the one that we in Scotland want to send out to the rest of the world.</p><p>I agree whole-heartedly with Bill Butler and I take on board what he said about MSPs writing to their local football clubs, whether amateur or professional, and telling them to sign up to the excellent UEFA 10-point plan. I know that various initiatives are going on within football clubs throughout Scotland and that they have done a marvellous job, but signing up for the 10-point plan would enhance that and it would show people out there that we in Scotland mean business.</p><p>If I may, I would like to touch on another form of racism by quoting a definition:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Racism is the belief of the superiority of a particular race, religion or ethnic group.\"</p><p>That definition of racism implies a much wider remit. Bill Butler referred to people's race, but we in Scotland must be honest and admit that racism involves religion as well as ethnic origin; we should look seriously at that. We have a particular problem in Scotland that we call sectarianism, but it is racism. We should perhaps tackle that in a holistic approach that tackles all forms of racism.</p><p>It does not matter whether someone is abused because of their colour or religion. Nobody should be subjected to such abuse and we in Scotland should not just sit back and accept that it happens. The recent incident involving graffiti about Neil Lennon, which was scrawled all over a road, is particularly upsetting, not just for the chap but for <place-holder colnum=\"8409\"/> everyone in Scotland who looks upon footballers as decent people who are just doing a job by playing a game of football. They should not be subjected to that type of racism.</p><p>Again, I congratulate Bill Butler and I hope that something will come out of the debate. I will certainly be writing to all the clubs that I know of, both amateur and professional, to encourage them to sign up to the 10-point plan. However, we must tackle the other form of racism in Scotland, which is obviously sectarianism.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318344", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Racism in Football"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Bill Butler for instigating this debate on an important issue.

In her speech, Fiona Hyslop referred to the fact that the Parliament is a legislative body and said that we should be legislating; we should not be debating a subject that, I believe, should be discussed by committees. As other members have said, the subject has been debated by the Education Committee and is being considered by the Justice 2 Committee. I believe that the committees are the right and proper place for such debates. The only debates that we should have in the chamber are those on which we have a vote.</p><p>I am concerned about the time that we have spent on the debate today. We recognise that the children's hearings system was introduced in 1971&#8212;although Scott Barrie mentioned 1968&#8212;which is a long time ago, but the subject should be debated by the parliamentary committees rather than in a full-day debate in the chamber. I agree with Donald Gorrie that a committee would be the proper vehicle for scrutiny of the overall situation of children's hearings and children's panels. However, the debate has started and I want to raise some issues. Perhaps the minister will give me some feedback when he sums up.</p><p>We should remember that the treatment of children in the home, the education system, the community and the justice system has a direct bearing on their behaviour. That is why I believe that children's panels and the children's hearings system, with its holistic approach, are the best way forward. I do not think that youth courts would be particularly helpful. We have heard from other members that England and Wales are considering reviewing their system of youth courts. As I have said before, it is 30 years or more since we considered the issue, so it may be time for us to look at it again. However, we should not do so in the chamber.</p><p>I will give members a couple of examples that illustrate why the holistic approach of children's panels and the children's hearings system is the right way forward. I refer to case studies in the papers that have been given to us. One such case relates to a girl called Kelly&#8212;obviously, that is not her real name&#8212;who is 14 and does not attend school regularly, as she falls asleep. If we look into the situation, we find that Kelly's mum is a drug addict and that Kelly has to look after her younger sister. Clearly, that is not Kelly's fault, as a children's panel would reveal.</p><p>Another case involves two young kids whose mother is regularly beaten by an abusive partner. Obviously, that has an effect on the children, who are not doing very well at school. I could give many more such examples. I am trying to explain that children's panels and the children's hearings system are the best way of dealing with those cases, as they examine all the facts holistically <place-holder colnum=\"8358\"/> and can put together a proper package for the children. We must be very careful before tinkering with the system.</p><p>Many members have mentioned members of children's panels, from whom I have received a number of letters. They state that MSPs are right to express concerns, because panel members are frustrated by the way in which they and the children who appear before panels are treated. However, they make it clear that their complaints are not directed against the children's hearings system. The problem is the lack of resources for panel members, as well as the lack of social workers and of funding more generally. That issue is very dear to the hearts of panel members. As has been said, they serve on a voluntary basis because they want to do something for society and for kids in the community. They are frustrated by the fact that their recommendations are sometimes not heard or adhered to&#8212;basically, agencies are ignoring them.</p><p>Some panel members say that agencies would dearly love to do something, but do not have the necessary funding. That point is central to any examination of the children's hearings system. We cannot ask people to develop the system when they do not have the necessary funding. We must take what they say seriously.</p><p>Johann Lamont and others referred to social work departments and other agencies and emphasised the need for a joined-up approach. That is an important point. I am not targeting social work departments&#8212;other local authority departments and schools have a role to play. Children's panels and the children's hearings system cannot act in isolation. We should do something to right the wrong that currently exists.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill will put even more pressure on children's panels and on social workers. Earlier, I spoke about the need for an holistic approach. I did so because I am a member of the Communities Committee, which is considering the bill. Marrying the bill with the review would have been advantageous and might have produced a better approach to children's panels and the children's hearings system. That is the reason why I began my speech on a negative note.</p><p>We must also consider seriously the recruitment and retention of social workers, to which Stewart Maxwell referred. We cannot continue recruiting social workers and failing to keep them. I ask the minister in his summing up to provide me with an update on the fast-track scheme that was announced on 12 February to bring more people into social work, so that we can see how many people have taken up the option and where it is <place-holder colnum=\"8359\"/> being advertised. I note that the minister is nodding.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Peter Peacock said that the Executive is taking stock of the issue and that the review is not about scrapping the system. I took comfort from that, but I was concerned when he said later that our system has not been fully replicated elsewhere in the world. I hope that the minister will explain what he meant by that remark, which seemed directly to contradict what Elaine Murray said about the various places, such as New Zealand and Guernsey, that are adapting their systems and adopting a similar system to ours. It is a good thing that other countries are adopting our system.</p><p>Like other members, I believe that the system that is in operation is excellent. It needs a certain amount of attention and improvement, but it also needs more resources and it does not need to be pulled apart. When the minister sums up, will he assure us that there will be no two-track system for children's hearings and panels?</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318195", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I did not want to start my speech on a negative note but, like other members, I question why we are having   this debate in the chamber, given that no vote will be taken.

The timing of the debate is appropriate, as it comes one year after the passing of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 and one year <place-holder colnum=\"7649\"/> before that act is fully implemented. The debate gives us an opportunity to assess what has happened and what we can do to make improvements before 2005.</p><p>I used to volunteer for mental health services, and I seem to remember doing a lot of outreach work, particularly in housing schemes. Unfortunately, a lot of that work has been discontinued but, having read Sandra Grant's report, I see that things have moved more towards community work, which should be commended. I look forward to the day when we go back to having more community health services, which were useful. I will return to the subject of community work, which was raised by Carolyn Leckie, Jackie Baillie and others.</p><p>One of the issues in Sandra Grant's report that was raised most frequently by service users and carers was the services that they wanted to be either improved or continued. In particular, they wanted the see me campaign to be continued, and I thank the minister for his announcement on that. That campaign has been very successful and I know that users and carers will welcome the announcement. Service users and carers mentioned responsible and positive reporting by the media, and I will return to that subject, too. They also wanted openness on the part of mental health services about what services are available and what information they can access; in particular, they wanted such information to be made available for carers, and not just for users.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson raised the paramount issue of the work force. Sandra Grant's report mentions that the position is likely to deteriorate further in Scotland. We need to take that into consideration, bearing in mind the level of training that is required. As we all know, there will not be any early change for the better; it was worrying to read that in Dr Grant's report. The report is honest, as members have said, and we should take cognisance of what it says.</p><p>David Davidson and Mike Rumbles mentioned the important issue of stigma, which has been raised again and again. I, too, would like to quote some figures from the survey that Mike Rumbles cited earlier. According to the survey, 64 per cent of young people said that they would be too embarrassed to disclose a mental illness or health problem to a prospective employer. I find that quite worrying. Only 37 per cent of employers said that they would be prepared to take on somebody who had said that they had a mental illness. I find that very worrying, too.</p><p>According to the same survey, 50 per cent of people said that media portrayal of mental health problems was much more negative than positive. That is why I ask the minister whether he could monitor the see me campaign. Once the campaign <place-holder colnum=\"7650\"/> has run its course, perhaps another survey could be done to find out the extent to which it has improved society's perception and, I hope, that of the media. If 50 per cent of people say that the media's portrayal of mental health problems is negative, that is a terrible indictment of the society in which we live today. I worry about that very much.</p><p>Carolyn Leckie highlighted the plight of people who live in deprived areas and the accessibility of services; the accessibility of services was also highlighted by Jackie Baillie and Mary Scanlon. Services must be accessible in the community, and I agree that we must ensure that people are not denied services simply because they cannot afford them or because they are not provided locally. That is a major issue, which Carolyn Leckie described very well.</p><p>We need to consider advocacy. I welcome the minister's recognition of the fact that demand for advocacy services will rise and I hope that he will ensure that advocacy is available to all, and not just to people who can access it and who can afford to do so. That is where the community aspect of the matter has to come in.</p><p>Many members, including Nanette Milne in her summing-up speech, mentioned children. It is very worrying to think that there are 125,000 children with mental health problems. Nanette Milne was right to say that early intervention is important if we are to help those vulnerable kids. If we could prevent something in society from getting worse, we would all be proud of that. We must pay special attention to the fact that such vast numbers of children are suffering. I am sure that all of us will be thinking about that carefully.</p><p>The minister mentioned the fact that the Executive is looking to more outreach work being undertaken. As I said, I used to do outreach work in the voluntary sector. Whole families used to come along, even if only one person in that family was suffering from some form of mental health problem, and I found that to be a good thing. Services were provided in centres&#8212;or clinics, as they were called in those days&#8212;that were located in the middle of communities, so families could bring their children, and mothers and fathers could come with the rest of the family. Perhaps because people were able to come along to meetings, there was less stigma. Neighbours and others got to know about the service, and I was amazed at the number of people who came along. I hope that we can get back to having more localised services like that. We must try to reach out and help the people concerned. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 was a good piece of work but, as Sandra Grant's report said, we must consider improving certain of its provisions.<place-holder colnum=\"7651\"/></p><p>Once again, I welcome this opportunity to debate the issue. We have heard about a number of issues around the lack of surgeons, psychiatric consultants, community services, advocacy and, obviously, funding, which I would like the minister to address when he sums up. Although there is funding for local health boards and local authorities, Sandra Grant's report found, as have people on the ground, that the money that is allocated for mental health services is not always used for that purpose; basically, the money is soaked into the general grant. Adam Ingram picked up on that point. Is there any way that the minister could ensure that that money is spent on mental health issues? There is an issue of ring fencing, which the minister might wish to address when he sums up.</p><p>We have to know where the money is being spent. It is all right to say that money is being given to local authorities and health boards to spend on mental health services, but if&#8212;as Sandra Grant's report, users and carers are indicating&#8212;the money is not being spent on those services and is being soaked up for something else, we require answers.</p><p>We must move forward. I appreciate the fact that we are doing something that Westminster might never have got round to doing. The Scottish Parliament should be proud of that. Let us get things moving. We recognise the problems. Let us solve them and give people with mental health issues a better deal and a higher quality of service.</p>", "hdate": "2004-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13316348", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I welcome the opportunity to debate this important issue.

If we go forward with the third party right of appeal, I believe that that will go some way towards addressing the concerns of the public at large, who will welcome the fact that the Executive is listening to them on that matter. I look forward to the end of the consultation process on the current planning document, but I remind the minister and members that my bill for such a right of appeal can be resurrected if there is not an overwhelming response in favour of a third party right of appeal.</p><p>Like Robert Brown, I am worried by press reports that the Confederation of British Industry Scotland and others are very much against the third party right of appeal, as if the only democratic right is for developers, but not for the public. I regret that such organisations use the newspapers and cross-party groups in Parliament to put forward those views. I hope that the <em>Official Report</em> of the debate can be sent to the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament for construction. I received an e-mail from one of the members of that group&#8212;he is not an MSP&#8212;who said that the third party right of appeal had been discussed at a cross-party group meeting and that it was called a \"meddlers charter\". If the report of this debate would not automatically be passed to it, I would like it to be passed to the cross-party group on construction. I had always thought that cross-party groups did not have political back-up; I hope to tell the convener of the group that in person.</p><p>I will get on to the matter in hand. Robert Brown and Johann Lamont mentioned greenfield sites. Johann Lamont made a point about council tax; I agree with what she said about the small pocket of council tax payers. However, we should look towards affordable housing, which is where brownfield sites&#8212;as Robert Brown mentioned&#8212;come into play. We should promote brownfield sites more vigorously than we do greenfield sites. I know that there is special dispensation to bring forward brownfield sites so that people can build on them, particularly if there are chemicals and so on there, but I would like to see more emphasis being placed on councils promoting brownfield sites rather than greenfield sites.</p><p>I do not want to name all the areas that Robert Brown named&#8212;I am sure that other members will also name some of them. An area that has not been mentioned is St Augustine playing fields in the Milton area, where lots of people train to play in football teams and so on. Those playing fields <place-holder colnum=\"7590\"/> still languish after the community fought hard to save them after a public inquiry, but nothing has been done to the land and it is earmarked for housing. I think that Robert Brown mentioned Thornwood park. A vigorous campaign was run by residents there&#8212;Robert Brown, Pauline McNeill, myself and others were at the public meetings on Thornwood park&#8212;but once again developers won and housing has been built there. Yorkhill park is another area where there was a right of way, but developers took no notice of that and housing will be built there.</p><p>We must be concerned about the issue not only in the city centre but in other areas. Greenfield sites are a bonus for people who live near them because their kids can go out to play there and they can walk their dogs there. Some folk do not particularly want to belong to a club, but they want to play football or whatever in a field. We should consider particularly the situation in the west end of Glasgow where land is at a premium&#8212;any tiny site there gets built upon. That is sad not only for people who live in the area but for people who pass through it. The buildings are so crammed in that it is unbelievable and the traffic and so on causes concern for everyone.</p><p>I was amazed to read about Kit Campbell's recent report in the newspaper. We should bear it in mind that Kit Campbell is an adviser to the Westminster Government and to the Executive improving public green spaces. His idea for improving public green spaces is to sell off poorly maintained and under-used football pitches, as he puts it, for housing development and land for homes. That is what an adviser to the Executive and to the Westminster Government has to say, so we should ask some questions about that. If we are to sell off land&#8212;as Kit Campbell suggests&#8212;what is there to prevent people from saying that amenities are surplus to requirement without having a public inquiry?</p><p>This is a very good debate; I welcome it and thank Robert Brown for securing it.</p>", "hdate": "2004-04-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13316281", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow (Green Space and Leisure Facilities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Robert Brown on securing this evening's debate, which is the first members' business debate in the new term.

After looking at the papers, I can only concur with what every member who has spoken before me has said about the good work that is done by the project. The statistics that were quoted by Cathie Craigie are proof that the project should continue, especially because of its emphasis on information gathering and sharing. That type of information is invaluable for the future, not just for the present. The project has turned around the statistics on underachievement and has been able to take evidence from various areas and from research that has been done and put it into practice. That is what we are looking towards: putting ideas into practice for the benefit of all deaf people.</p><p>Cathie Craigie talked about the response to the questionnaires. There was a 99.4 per cent return from schools, which is fantastic&#8212;that level of response would put a Scottish election to shame. That shows that the public, the schools and the deaf community take such work very seriously. Those people are willing to take part in that type of research; we do not always get that willingness, so we should not lose it once we have it.

He was, and still is, a fantastic artist, and was probably the loudest, most outgoing and sociable person in our group. When it came to saying what we wanted to do when we left school, he chose architecture. This was more than 40 years ago and many deaf people will identify with what I am about to say. He did not have the recommended qualifications to pursue that career. That was not because he was not talented, but because, at that time, not enough was done to encourage deaf people to get those qualifications. I still go out for a drink with him and, although he has had various jobs, he is not bitter; he is a very happy person. However, when I speak to him, I think what a loss he has been to our society and what a shame it is that such a talented person did not get the opportunities that hearing people got just because he was deaf.

On behalf of all the pupils who attend those schools and who desperately want to fulfil their potential, I ask the minister to continue the funding.

I point out to him that if Scotland was independent, the health service would not be in the situation that it is in today.</p><p>I give a sincere welcome to the bill. Like Shona Robison and other members said, the bill is long overdue. I will not rehearse all of the problems that we have had with the health boards, consultations and so on. Instead, I want to concentrate on two specific areas. The first is the duty on health boards to co-operate in the planning and provision <place-holder colnum=\"6215\"/> of services. My colleague Stewart Maxwell will elaborate on that issue in his contribution. The other area that I want to cover is the duty to encourage public involvement, which has caused such a lot of consternation not only in Glasgow but in other areas of the country. The reason why I cite those two areas for attention is that it was the lack of proper co-operation and public involvement that caused such a furore and such concern in the review of maternity services in Glasgow and in the health board's recommendation to close the Queen Mother's hospital.</p><p>This morning, a petition was submitted to the Public Petitions Committee on behalf of six eminent medical practitioners. They called for some of the things that I think are included in the bill, but I ask the minister to clarify that when he sums up. The petitioners called for a legal framework for consultation, for guidelines and for an independent process for the selection of expert witnesses when a national review of services is to take place, whether or not that is a maternity services review. If those are included in the bill, that is most welcome. If they are not, perhaps the minister will lodge amendments at stage 2.</p><p>The minister said in his opening speech that the bill is very much needed. One of the key aims of the bill is to enhance the powers of ministers, in particular to intervene in areas where there are service failures. That point was raised by Kate Maclean. The powers that ministers will have are of concern.</p><p>I will elaborate on that a little bit. I have considered the issue from a different angle, through consultation, legal advice and the Scottish Parliament information centre. If it is found that health boards have not complied with the legislation, for example with section 5, on public involvement, will they be guilty under section 44(2) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 of not following through an act of Parliament? I would like the minister to think about that. If he cannot give me an answer in summing up, he can give me an answer later.</p><p>I seek clarification because we all know that health boards have a duty to consult, but the bill will make the duty to encourage public involvement legally binding. If they do not do that, they will be guilty of committing a criminal act under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, because the duty is in the legislation. I would like verification of that important point.</p><p>I sought advice on that point when the health board's maternity review was on-going in Glasgow and was given lots of good legal advice by officials and SPICe. Because the duty to consult is only a duty, boards are not guilty of committing a criminal act for not carrying it out. However, if the duty is in legislation of the Scottish Parliament, they could <place-holder colnum=\"6216\"/> be guilty of committing a criminal act. Would they be guilty of committing such a criminal act? Is the point that ministers have enhanced powers and can intervene?</p><p>Like other members, I am worried about the lack of detail in the financial memorandum. Perhaps we will see savings in the long term, but in the beginning, during the transition period, there will be costs.

The list is so long that I cannot possibly go through all of them, but we certainly appreciate the very good work that they carry out, sometimes in difficult conditions. I am speaking in particular of nurses and others who happen to work in accident and emergency departments at the weekend who, unfortunately, are not given proper protection. We debated the issue several weeks ago and I am sure that the Parliament could have passed something that would have given all public service workers the protection that I believe they deserve.</p><p>I give a big thanks to Irene Yardley and the others at Glasgow royal infirmary who have worked tirelessly to get proper protection for nurses, who are, after all, going about their duty and should not be subjected to attacks by drunken and violent patients. I hope that the minister will consider the matter again and perhaps monitor the situation and give us a report on what is happening in accident and emergency departments at the weekends when, unfortunately, people are drunk and violent. I look forward to getting such a report.</p><p>I listened to the minister's speech and I appreciate the sentiments that he expressed about the challenges that are being faced in achieving and sustaining a viable and professional work <place-holder colnum=\"6141\"/> force within the NHS. However, as Shona Robison and other members have mentioned, vacancies within the NHS have risen considerably since 1999 under the Lib-Lab coalition Government, regardless of what Mike Rumbles says. For example, consultant vacancies in Glasgow have risen by a massive 156 per cent and the number of nursing vacancies has risen from 282 to 784.</p><p>I acknowledge the minister's comments about recruitment, but it is five years since the Lib-Lab coalition Government took over, so the question is why, after all that time, we are having this debate all of a sudden. Is the Lib-Lab coalition Government only now recognising that we are so short of consultants and nurses? The Government seems to be paying lip service to the problem, but it is a bit late and it is acting once the horse has bolted.</p><p>The situation is of serious concern, particularly when it is coupled with the report published by Audit Scotland the other day. The report states that a quarter of all machines, including X-ray machines, in the health service in Scotland are obsolete&#8212;some of them are 15 years over their lifespan. That must give us all cause for concern. As I said, the Government has been in power for five years yet we are reading that kind of report. I congratulate Audit Scotland on its honesty, because I assure members that if it was up to the trust&#8212;particularly the one in Glasgow&#8212;we would never have found out any of the information.</p><p>Clinicians and staff must have access to proper equipment. In some hospitals, they have the equipment but they do not have the manual on how to work it and the person who used to work it has retired. That is a ridiculous situation.</p><p>I want to pick up on what the minister said about maternity services and the falling birth rate, which he suggested was the reason for having fewer midwives. I have spoken to midwives and they tell me that lots of midwives go into training but head down south once they have finished, because the conditions there are much better. If the minister speaks to midwives, he will hear the same thing.</p><p>The minister says that we can centralise maternity services, but there is a direct contradiction with the First Minister's statement the other day. The First Minister is calling for people to come to Scotland; I think that he wanted 8,000 immigrants to come each year. It is dangerous to assume that we can close hospitals&#8212;particularly maternity hospitals&#8212;and centralise services when we are actively encouraging population growth. We must consider a moratorium on such closures.</p><p>Janis Hughes is right about nursing. People do not have to go into academia to do nursing. Des McNulty and I were at a meeting on Saturday and this was one of the topics that came up. Among <place-holder colnum=\"6142\"/> the people there were ex-nurses and they asked why people's life experience could not be considered. They asked why people could not become nurses without going to university. I hope that the minister takes up Janis's suggestion.</p><p>Mary Scanlon put the fear of death into me when she talked about people pulling out their own teeth. My grandfather used to pull out his own teeth, but it surely should not be a self-inflicted cure. Mary represents the Highlands and Islands and if people there have to listen to Mike Rumbles, perhaps they do feel like pulling out their own teeth. I will leave that to Mary's discretion.</p><p>Duncan McNeil mentioned the European working time directive and doctors' hours. He is right to say that services are being impinged upon. However, we have known about the directive for nine years. It was never going to go away; it was always going to happen.

We all know that good citizenship takes the form of young people respecting not only themselves, but those around them, regardless of their creed or anything else. From one of the papers that I have been given, I noticed that the Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust shares that view. <place-holder colnum=\"4782\"/></p><p>The trust includes it in a programme called respect, which I believe the minister mentioned in his opening speech.</p><p>The minister also mentioned the appointment of a tsar&#8212;I do not know whether that person will be called a sex tsar&#8212;but I do not see the need for a tsar if good citizenship is put together with the Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust's respect programme and sex education is introduced within that programme. If we had a tsar, we would end up with lots of bureaucracy; I really feel that that would hinder the strategy rather than help it. I therefore ask the minister to take on board the suggestion that we amalgamate good citizenship education, the respect programme and sex education.</p><p>We all know and, I think, agree that the only way forward for Scotland and its young people in the long term is for young people to be taught from a very early age in schools and other places of education to have respect for others. That is something that members have mentioned, but we must also remember that with respect comes responsibility. It is Parliament's responsibility to ensure not only that young people know that information on sex education is available, but that they are able to access that information. It is a big problem that such information is not easily accessible.</p><p>I will pick up on points that several members made about the morning-after pill. I also have concerns about the morning-after pill in relation not only to its supply in schools, but in relation to over-the-counter prescribing of it. My main concern is about the long-term damage that the pill might do to young women's health. Our strategy should not just be about unwanted pregnancies; we should also monitor the long-term effects of certain contraceptives, particularly the morning-after pill. We owe that to our young people&#8212;we should not just introduce such things without monitoring their long-term effects. For a long time women have been used as guinea pigs in attempts to prevent unwanted pregnancies. I often wonder whether the morning-after pill is another example of that and whether in 10 or 20 years' time we will see more effects of it on young women. The minister should consider that as part of the strategy.</p><p>Des McNulty mentioned the Black Street clinic. He is right that nobody talked about it; it was hidden away and there seemed to be a stigma attached to it. That says a lot about the way we approach sex in general. For years in Scotland, sex has been spoken about behind closed doors and sniggered about on the playing fields or behind the sheds at school. We have to get away from that attitude; we have to make young people feel confident, responsible and respectful.<place-holder colnum=\"4783\"/></p><p>The report calls for a mass communications strategy, with which I could not agree more. I urge the Executive to say that there are excellent strategies out there; a lot of people do not know that the clinics involved exist. The Sandyford initiative, which is based at Sauchiehall Street, is excellent. Although a lot of people know about it, some do not. It runs outreach clinics, is city-centre based and has an open-door policy. It does not only provide for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases; it offers advice about such diseases, and every type of service to do with sexual health is available there. I ask the minister to consider the Sandyford initiative with a view to emulating it throughout Scotland. It is one of the best and we should do something with it.

As someone who has at times sparred with its representatives, I should take this opportunity to congratulate the council&#8212;and in particular my long-time political sparring partner, Alistair Watson&#8212;on all the hard work that has been carried out not just in Cardonald but throughout the local authority area.</p><p>Glasgow City Council has been successful in the vigorous way that it has pursued this matter and I hope that the introduction of 20mph speed zones around schools will be rolled out throughout the country. However, I am worried that money will be concentrated only on zones surrounding schools and will not be allocated to areas in and around hospitals and to housing schemes that are located slightly away from schools. I know that members are always asking for more money, but I must ask the minister whether, in addition to the &#163;4 million that has been allocated, there will be any more money to extend the 20mph speed limit to other residential areas and housing schemes.</p><p>I realise that members will talk about their own areas. Bill Butler mentioned Anniesland, but there are many other areas within Glasgow city. For example, people assume that, because Townhead and Garnethill are in the city centre, there are no children there. I assure members that many kids live in those areas. Indeed, people seem to forget that Townhead, which is sometimes used as a rat-run, is actually a housing scheme. As a result, I am glad to see that a 20mph speed zone has been introduced for a school in that area. However, people simply zoom through other parts of Townhead to get on to the motorway. In that respect, I must pay tribute to Glasgow City Council <place-holder colnum=\"4281\"/> for its decision to introduce speed bumps in that area.</p><p>People do not realise that the Garnethill area at the top of Sauchiehall Street contains nursery, primary and secondary schools. Because so much is going on in the city centre, they tend to take their cars up into the area around the Glasgow School of Art. Anyone who has walked up Rose Street and the aptly named Hill Street will know that those streets are very steep and unfortunately cars sometimes come speeding down them. I hope the minister will also comment on that particular issue.</p><p>As I said earlier, I congratulate Bill Butler on lodging his motion, and I also congratulate Glasgow City Council on being at the forefront of pushing the 20mph zones. However, I would like the initiative to be extended, and I hope that the minister can give us some assurances that there will be more money to extend the zones, not just to roads outside schools but to roads outside hospitals and to roads in residential areas, which sometimes become a bit of a rat-run.

I do not say that just because Renfrewshire Council's area and the Glasgow airport area are my old stomping grounds. As Trish Godman said, Unity Enterprise's work is not confined to Renfrewshire and Glasgow airport&#8212;it reaches out all over Glasgow, to Inverclyde and other areas.</p><p>I compliment Unity Enterprise on its work. Perhaps Johann Lamont will comment on that, because today she brought together 40 or 50 carers from throughout Glasgow. It was interesting to see carers' reactions to questions. Tonight, we are debating people who have learning disabilities and who may be cared for, but who are doing a marvellous job of caring for other people. The people to whom I have spoken in the confines of the airport about the work that is done there say that the project is excellent.</p><p>Like Trish Godman, I ask whether the Minister for Transport is the right minister to respond to the <place-holder colnum=\"4052\"/> debate. Perhaps the Minister for Communities or the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning could respond, as Trish Godman said.</p><p>The Executive has a strategy for carers, which was discussed at today's meeting with carers. Could we have a strategy to monitor what happens to people with disabilities? Perhaps a bit more help could be provided in Unity Enterprise's area, where such good work is being done.</p><p>One reason for having this debate relates to people with learning disabilities. Sometimes the phrase \"learning disabilities\" is not liked; language and labelling can be big problems. Such people are starting to get their lives together with the help of agencies; they then push forward and help other people. As Trish Godman said, it is important that they can live in their own homes in Maryhill and other areas. People are being given the benefits of independence and are, as a result, reaching out and helping other people.</p><p>We could consider expanding such work. In airports, people in wheelchairs and elderly people are not always helped as they should be. Perhaps that is why the Minister for Transport is here. Unity Enterprise does an excellent job within the airport.</p><p>Work should not stop where it does; rather it should be progressed. As Trish Godman said, people are not only helping themselves and others, but are gaining a wee bit of confidence. I hope that they get on to the employment ladder, which is where Unity Enterprise and similar projects will come to the fore. Such organisations have the expertise, experience and contacts that can help people to get onto the employment ladder and to lead lives that are like the lives other people lead. Nothing should hold them back&#8212;if they are prepared to put themselves forward and to help other people, Parliament should be prepared to help them.</p><p>I hope that Unity Enterprise&#8212;along with other such projects&#8212;will be monitored and that its good work will be considered in order to find out whether it can be stretched out further than Glasgow, Inverclyde and Renfrewshire, and in order to establish a strategy for such projects. We should recognise that people want to contribute and that they are contributing.</p><p>As always, finance is an issue, but we should acknowledge that people are already contributing emotionally and financially, so Parliament should contribute, too. If that takes finance, strategies and projects, we should consider those and view the issue in the wider sphere.</p><p>Again, I congratulate Trish Godman on securing the debate.

I say to the minister and the Executive that the special emphasis that they have put on violence against women is most welcome. Unfortunately, the issue will not go away. When we look at the figures, we can see that something is going terribly wrong. We must get to the nub of the issue: why does violence continually increase, year after year? It might be that, with the continuing advertising campaigns that highlight domestic abuse, women are becoming more confident in reporting incidents to the police, as Frances Curran mentioned.</p><p>However, I believe that the upsurge in domestic violence&#8212;and violence against women as a whole&#8212;is also related to some men's disregard of <place-holder colnum=\"3710\"/> women as equals. We should reconsider the national strategy that was produced to address domestic abuse. The strategy centres on prevention, protection and provision&#8212;that is fine, but the strategy must also put more emphasis on education, particularly given that one in five young men think that it is all right to be violent towards women and that one in ten young women think that violence towards women is acceptable.</p><p>Education must play a bigger part in the strategy; I mean not only education in schools, but education through the media. When we look at the ways in which women are portrayed in films, magazines, videos and in some places of so-called entertainment, there is scope for a strategy to educate the media on women's role in the world. There is a direct link between violence and what happens in some places of entertainment. Some people say that we cannot control the media; that might be so, but we have legislative powers over places of entertainment and the licensing of such places.</p><p>For example, we are considering the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. I have suggested that we amend the 1982 act, as has Glasgow City Council, and I believe that Edinburgh City Council is also considering the 1982 act in relation to the licensing of places of entertainment such as lap-dancing and table-dancing clubs, which could be licensed in the same way as sex shops. I hope that the minister will take that on board and consider amending the 1982 act, as that would be welcome. Women are portrayed as objects, not people, in those clubs.</p><p>When we talk about lap-dancing clubs, sex shops and other such places of so-called entertainment, we have an obligation to women in society to make the case that such entertainment is not acceptable. I am not being prudish about what goes on in those clubs; I am considering their wider impact on society and how women are perceived as objects, whose bodies can be used and abused.</p><p>Until we educate not just men but society as a whole to relate to women on equal terms, and until we make inroads into changing what I call the laddish culture that is so prevalent&#8212;particularly in the media&#8212;we will, unfortunately, continue to have debates such as this one. It would be a dreadful indictment of the 21<sup>st</sup> century if we had to turn up next year to have the same debate. There should be a little more education of the media and we should take a firmer hand in educating young people and society as a whole to treat women as equals, because I believe that the way in which women are portrayed contributes to their being regarded and used as objects and to the perpetration of violence against them.

Greater Glasgow NHS Board has forgotten that.</p><p>I mentioned the Yorkhill complex, which houses both the Queen Mum's and the sick kids hospital and has been at the forefront of pioneering techniques. I know that other members want to comment on that point. I refer to techniques such as foetal diagnosis and therapy; Professor Ian Donald also pioneered ultrasound for maternity services at Yorkhill. Professionals are seriously concerned that if the Queen Mum's closes the experience and expertise that both hospitals have built up will be lost.</p><p>The support that other medical professionals throughout Scotland and beyond have given to their colleagues at the Queen Mum's is a sign that the campaign to avoid closure is not just a knee-jerk reaction to a local inconvenience&#8212;it is a Scotland-wide campaign. Today I received a phone call from a campaigner who told me that he has written to the Queen on this issue. She has written back to him to say that she has contacted Dr John Reid. If the minister is not already au fait with that, perhaps he should contact Dr John Reid MP, who might intervene on the campaign's behalf if the Executive does not wish to do so.</p><p>I turn my attention to the consultation process, which is the nub of the issue. From the beginning the consultation process was flawed to the point of being a sham. If, as some people are saying, that is not the case, why was the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health not invited to <place-holder colnum=\"3575\"/> contribute? What about the concerns of paediatric cardiologists at Yorkhill, who have had to write to the newspapers to get over their information about the 60 newborn babies with serious heart disease who have been treated in the sick children's hospital in the past year? Why were the views of child psychiatrists not noted? Experts such as Alice McGrath and Michael Morton have stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We do not believe the way forward involves the closure of a specialist centre that allows sick babies and their mothers to be together as much as possible\".</p><p>Recently I attended a public meeting where emotions were running very high. The two most telling contributions came from health professionals who were pleading the case for the Queen Mother's hospital. One of those professionals, Anthea Dixon, spoke of the special relationship that helps to make the Yorkhill site world renowned for the care of babies and children. She expressed her concerns that she had not received a copy of the consultation evidence from the health board. I have not received a copy, either, even after repeated requests.</p><p>Professor Cockburn, who is highly thought of, spoke with real emotion about the work that is carried out at the Queen Mother's hospital, much of which would be disrupted if closure went ahead. He was truly angered that his evidence and that of many other eminent health professionals was not included in the consultation document. As well as all those experts who were ignored in the so-called consultation, there have been approximately 100,000 signatures on a petition from concerned citizens all over Scotland and beyond. Although Catriona Renfrew of the Greater Glasgow NHS Board has arrogantly announced that public opinion will not influence the closure decision at all, we politicians cannot afford to behave in such a high-handed manner.

The minister has praised SPT and I am sure that Malcolm Reid and Alistair Watson will be very pleased to hear that praise. It will be news to them.</p><p>I want to emphasise a point made in our amendment to the Executive's motion&#8212;that the new agency</p><p class=\"indent\">\"should not undermine the role and function of Strathclyde Passenger Transport\".</p><p>I mention that because I want to pick up on a point in the minister's speech. He said that SPT in its current form cannot deliver. In his summing up, I would like the minister to explain that statement and to answer this question: does the Government intend to abolish SPT?</p><p>I have not always praised SPT&#8212;in fact, if any criticism was being made, I was probably the first to make it. However, when praise is deserved, I will praise. The great strength of SPT is that it is locally driven and not centralised; I think that the minister mentioned that in his speech. If SPT is centralised, I and others believe that less focus will be put on local issues. SPT and the new agency will not be able to concentrate on areas, or put in the time and expertise, in the way that SPT can at the moment. As other members have mentioned, a lack of sufficient powers is also a weakness, not just for SPT but for other transport authority areas. I would like SPT and other regional transport authorities to be given more powers and to be driven more locally, because that would allow them to do a much better job.<place-holder colnum=\"2892\"/></p><p>The deregulation of the bus network must be reviewed urgently, through consultation or whatever, because it has caused heartache and has been a disaster for the general public and SPT, which is the first port of call for people who make complaints. It is a travesty of justice that bus companies can withdraw bus services without any explanation. We must examine that.</p><p>In Glasgow, for example, 56 per cent of households do not have access to cars, so public transport is vital in providing people with access to different areas, which they need for going to the doctor and so on. I agree with what the minister said about the need for joined-up thinking, but I wonder whether the new agency will be able to deliver on that. SPT has a good track record in that regard and I do not see why it should not have more powers to carry on that work.</p><p>SPT and I have concerns about what will happen to rail powers if the new agency comes on board and SPT is diluted or abolished. The creation of the new agency would certainly remove the west of Scotland's input into rail strategy. Most of the powers of procurement would be given to the Strategic Rail Authority, which is based in London. I know how much bother I and others have had for asking for funding for the crossrail system, for example, which has been debated since the day I came into the Parliament. There have been about 10 motions on that subject, but we still do not see any funds being provided. I worry that that is what will happen if the new agency goes ahead.</p><p>The minister said that central funding was a very controversial system; it certainly is, especially since local government reorganisation in 1996. SPT and others have said that not only is central funding a controversial and convoluted system, it is highly unfair. I will quote a couple of figures that I have cited before in written questions. In 2002-03, West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority, which has 2.5 million passengers, was given consent to borrow &#163;50 million, whereas SPT, which has 2.2 million passengers, was given consent to borrow only &#163;28 million. I could go on providing figures, but I do not want to use up my speech in that way; I can send the minister the relevant papers.</p><p>If the proposed new agency comes about and SPT still exists, will that give the Parliament and SPT more powers, both in relation to crossrail and to borrowing more money, which would help to give us a better system? I ask the minister to answer that in his summing up.</p>", "hdate": "2003-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13303971", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to concentrate on one particular area&#8212;Strathclyde Passenger Transport.

They tell me that they see that as their duty.</p><p>Scott Barrie and other members have highlighted a number of issues. It is important that we examine the way in which agism affects membership of children's panels. I know many people who are 70 or 80 years of age and who could put me to shame, never mind younger people.</p><p>We also need to consider the under-representation of ethnic minorities on panels and the fact that, for some reason, men are not taking up places on panels. Scott Barrie suggested that <place-holder colnum=\"2703\"/> that may be the result of work commitments, but during the past 30 years, as children's panels have evolved, men have had more time to get involved in the voluntary sector. More women now work, and if they can find the time to serve on children's panels I am sure that men can do the same. The Executive has run an advertising programme to encourage men to become more involved, and further advertising would be more than welcome. I urge more men to consider serving on children's panels.</p><p>As Duncan McNeil said, the members of children's panels come from all airts and pairts and should include people who have worked in shipyards with apprentices. We need to involve everyone in panels&#8212;their membership should be much more wide ranging than it is at the moment.</p><p>I congratulate the Executive on investing more funds in children's panels, especially in the Glasgow area, and I thank it for doing so. Some people may disagree with the fast-tracking of social workers, but not everyone opposes it when the aim is to enable more social workers to assist children's panels. We could say that children's panels are absolutely marvellous. The volunteers who offer their services to panels are marvellous and panels do a good job. However, we cannot ignore the fact that there is a lack of social workers, which is a big problem. We all recognise that.</p><p>I will not repeat everything that children's panel members have said to me. However, children's panels were set up as a means of intervention before children become involved in criminal activities. Unfortunately, at the moment we are failing those vulnerable children, because some of them do not have social work reports.</p><p>Scott Barrie made the point to Fiona Hyslop and Mary Scanlon that people leave children's panels because of work and family commitments. Like the children's panel members that Mary Scanlon mentioned, the members of the Glasgow children's panel to whom I have spoken are leaving out of frustration. They do not feel that their work is being undermined, but that they are not able to fulfil the duty for which they volunteered. They believe that they are failing the children whom they set out to serve.</p><p>I know that we are actively involved in trying to recruit more social workers, but we must monitor what happens in the long term. We can throw money at any problem, but if there is no monitoring to determine whether that is working it is hardly worth while.</p><p>I sincerely congratulate everyone who offers their time and energies to children's panels. It is up to the Scottish Parliament to ensure that adequate resources&#8212;whether money or social <place-holder colnum=\"2704\"/> workers&#8212;are provided to enable them to help kids who are desperately in need.

Unfortunately, I was at another meeting and had to wait before I was let into the chamber.</p><p>I am involved in drafting a member's bill that has gone out for consultation, and am very grateful to <place-holder colnum=\"2213\"/> the non-Executive bills unit for drawing my attention to the difficulties of mainstreaming equality. As a result, I have been looking at what it means to mainstream equality&#8212;in particular the groups that I have to contact and the language that I have to use in covering letters about my bill. I will not tout the bill, because I think that everyone knows what it is. NEBU drew my attention to particular areas that, as an MSP, I was not aware of. Indeed, I do not think that many people are aware of just how deep mainstreaming equality goes and I am eternally grateful to Cathy Peattie and the committee for producing this report.</p><p>Cathy Peattie and others have mentioned mainstreaming equality in the committees and I wholeheartedly agree that mainstreaming must take place, not only in committees but throughout the parliamentary process. I also agree with Elaine Smith that we must monitor the situation to find out how mainstreaming has been carried out and to gather any results that pertain to it.</p><p>I suppose that we are embarking on a programme of reform, because such mainstreaming has never taken place before. We must realise that, as far as equality proofing is concerned, there must be greater transparency and accountability. Indeed, transparency and accountability should become the norm when, as we hope, mainstreaming equality becomes the norm for the parliamentary process. That is why I think that monitoring is very important&#8212;we must ensure that mainstreaming is carried through.</p><p>Equally important is our commitment to engage the many groups that feel disengaged from the Parliament. As many members have pointed out, lack of access is one of the main barriers not just to mainstreaming equality but to people's involvement in the parliamentary process and we need to reach out to the groups that have been very much neglected. I want us to consider not only access but other areas where equality mainstreaming will help and where people will be consulted and enabled to take part in the parliamentary process.</p><p>It is important to consider physical access. Most members think that we have gone some way towards making the Parliament more accessible, as well as making it easier to reach polling stations, but I assure them that there are plenty of places in the area that I represent where access is not easy. If that access is not forthcoming, we will have to consider how people can get to such venues, which means looking at transport. People who have children will need some form of child minding, and carers' responsibilities will also have to be considered. If people vote in a different way&#8212;electronically, for example&#8212;we will have to consider that too.</p><p>We must ensure that information is accessible <place-holder colnum=\"2214\"/> because it is central to any good consultation process. Where there are language barriers, for example, we must provide interpreters. Presentation barriers are also covered by equality mainstreaming.</p><p>We have to think about small groups that might not have the finances to contribute their ideas to a consultation process. Perhaps we should consider providing financial support as well as other types of support.</p><p>Appropriate training for staff has been mentioned. In my opening remarks I said that I did not realise how wide ranging equality mainstreaming was, so perhaps MSPs should also receive training.</p><p>Feedback is important. If we want people to engage in and be serious about equality mainstreaming, we need to give them feedback on all the consultation documents that they have looked at or with which they have been involved. The Deputy Presiding Officer Trish Godman and I were involved in the previous Local Government Committee, and when we took the consultation process out to the people, they were most concerned about the lack of feedback that they received. The Local Government Committee rectified that situation by giving out feedback. That is an important point: people participate in consultation, but they do not get any feedback. We must give people feedback and make accessible any information that pertains to them.</p><p>I congratulate the Equal Opportunities Committee on the report and I look forward to seeing its recommendations mainstreamed throughout the Parliament.</p>", "hdate": "2003-10-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13302327", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mainstreaming Equality"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to Cathy Peattie for not being present when she began her opening speech.

However, like my colleagues, I have concerns about how the debate has been conducted. There is no motion and no amendments and there will be no vote at the end of the day. I want to record in the <em>Official Report</em> that I hope that such debates do not become talking shops that result in all talk and no action&#8212;I fear that there is a real danger that that will happen. I will be interested to hear what the minister says about that in summing up.</p><p>I want to concentrate on Glasgow and the health of its citizens and to say something about the situation in which Glasgow finds itself. Glasgow is the powerhouse of Scotland. It is the commercial and financial centre for half the nation's population and has national and international status as a city of cultural significance. However, Glasgow's people consistently find themselves left at the bottom end of successive Governments' health league tables, whether those Governments are Labour and Lib Dem, or Tory&#8212;in other words, I am talking about unionist Governments. For a city with such wealth and the capacity to generate more wealth, Glasgow is, perversely, home to some of the worst areas of multiple deprivation not just in Scotland but in the United Kingdom. The dependence on benefits in areas such as Shettleston, Drumchapel and Ruchill is an affront to human dignity in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p>The minister mentioned healthy eating initiatives. There is a healthy eating initiative at the Annexe in Stewartville Street in Partick, and outreach staff at local health centres such as that in Drumchapel do excellent work. Such work contributes greatly to turning the tide in favour of health improvements, but we believe that such efforts are greatly constrained by funding limitations. I ask the minister to consider that matter with regard to the scale of deprivation rather than population.</p><p>Members have mentioned hospital reorganisation in Glasgow, which the Executive should also consider. We in Glasgow refer to such reorganisation as hospital closures. A city with special health needs that result from widespread deprivation, heart disease, diabetes, oral and lung cancer, childhood ailments such as leukaemia and even malnutrition should receive better rather than fewer facilities in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Glasgow faces the closure of two of its five main hospitals and a reduction to only two fully operational accident and emergency departments from five such departments. Where does that leave the people of Glasgow when they face a significant accident or terrorist incident? Where does it leave them in the face of a flu epidemic or some other epidemic? <place-holder colnum=\"1860\"/></p><p>Such closures in a city that has as poor a health record as any city in western Europe are driven by the balance sheet and not by patient need&#8212;the minister and the Executive must consider that matter.</p><p>I agree entirely with Duncan McNeil, Mary Scanlon and Jamie Stone that health boards are not listening to the very people whom they are supposed to represent. Furthermore, although the Golden Jubilee national hospital in Clydebank is innovative and worth while, it is poaching scarce medical staff from already stretched NHS hospitals in the Glasgow area. I ask the minister to reply to the various written questions that I have put to him about that matter.</p><p>Pauline McNeill mentioned Yorkhill. I have a query regarding the protection of the special status of the Royal hospital for sick children at Yorkhill. Two years ago, when Susan Deacon was Minister for Health and Community Care, she mentioned the protection of that special status in her review. I have spoken to many doctors, constituents and consultants who see the threatened closure of the Queen Mother's hospital maternity unit at Yorkhill as the beginning of the reduction in status of the sick kids hospital. Pauline McNeill and other members have mentioned that the two hospitals at Yorkhill are unique. They provide a one-stop shop of excellence for mothers and children&#8212;not just for Glasgow, but for 50 per cent of the rest of Scotland. If the maternity unit at the Queen Mother's hospital closes, there will be no maternity hospital in the west end of Glasgow and Yorkhill's uniqueness will be under threat. The minister should look closely at that matter.</p><p>Glasgow must be seen as a special case in respect of health&#8212;I make no apology for pleading that case here and at every available opportunity.</p><p>Members should excuse me while I drink some water.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13301375", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Improving Scotland's Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome any debate about the health of the people of Scotland.

I admit that I enjoy a drink. I found the atmosphere to be civilised and, until about 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock, there were no problems in the city centre.</p><p>I welcome the debate and the examination of the alcohol licensing system in Scotland. It is well known that the culture around alcohol in Scotland is to use and abuse it, which creates associated problems. I welcome anything that will help to alleviate or stop those problems. I hope that the <place-holder colnum=\"1779\"/> debate will get down to the nitty-gritty and that we will get some answers in the summing-up speeches or in a later consultation.</p><p>As I said, in the past couple of months I have enjoyed sitting outside in Glasgow city centre, where I live. Although it is great to be at the hub and among the buzz, I assure members that during the weekend, the situation can be horrendous when I look out of my window or come home at night. That applies to people walking on Queen Street or Sauchiehall Street, or even George Square or Argyle Street. I have seen out of my window&#8212;and stepped over&#8212;comatose young boys and girls lying on the pavement, in the gutter or on the road. They can barely lift their heads, never mind themselves, off the ground. Questions must be asked why kids are served alcohol in pubs and clubs and allowed to get into such a state before leaving.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have also seen adults&#8212;mostly men&#8212;urinating on people's doorsteps. People come out and remonstrate and that is when alcohol-related violence can occur. Where are the police at such times? I have seen police vans in the city centre at night, but I never see police walking around at that time. I am sure that giving the police more financial resources would help to alleviate the problem of alcohol-related violence, because the police would be better able to monitor the streets.</p><p>The Nicholson report refers to training for licensees and people who work in pubs. Such training is important, because we must get across the message that it is not acceptable to serve more alcohol to someone who is over the limit and can hardly stand up.</p><p>I welcome the report's reference to national forums and to local people being involved. However, I have questions about the forums. In particular, will there be legislation for the national forums that will also cover licensing boards? The Scottish Licensed Trade Association is concerned about that issue, as I am. The report states that licensing boards should listen to advice from regional or national forums, but it does not comment on what the boards should do with such advice. I, and I am sure most people, would like clarification on that point.</p><p>Kenny MacAskill is correct to say that we cannot consider the issue only in relation to Scotland's drinking culture and peer pressure. We must have a more holistic approach. We must consider not only Scottish drinking culture, but aspects such as appropriate training, education and the number of police on the beat. We must ensure that additional resources are provided to allow more police to be on the beat. As members will know, the police who are on the beat in Glasgow city centre are taken from other areas. The number of clubbers who are <place-holder colnum=\"1780\"/> in the city centre on a Saturday night is comparable to the population of Perth. It is worrying that we do not have sufficient police to deal with such large numbers.</p><p>Pauline McNeill referred to the transport system. We must have an adequate transport system for the thousands of people who might come out of clubs at staggered times; I use the word \"staggered\" advisedly.</p><p>I look forward to enjoying more liberal and more civilised licensing hours, as I was able to do in the past couple of months.

Robert Brown has created a smokescreen that tries to let them off the hook, but people outside the chamber will not let them off the hook any more. Once again, what we see today is the might and weight of Westminster against the fright of the Lib-Lab Government.

Shona Robison talked about salaries. I know that Pauline McNeill, who is no longer in the chamber, spoke about staffing problems and the need to attract specialists. We must consider that issue carefully. The minister admitted that, although we have attracted specialists, a big gap remains in oncology, about which there is much concern. We must consider ways of encouraging specialists in that area to locate to our hospitals, rather than elsewhere. It is nice to think that, because we are providing services, specialists will come here, but deep down money matters to them, regardless of the research that is being undertaken. Shona Robison's idea of offering variable conditions and enhanced terms is a good one, which the minister should consider.<place-holder colnum=\"1465\"/></p><p>David Davidson and Ken Macintosh talked about providing information, which is an important issue. I refer not just to information about health&#8212;diet, exercise and smoking&#8212;but to access to information, if members will forgive me for saying information two or three times.

With early diagnosis, people's chances of survival are much higher. Macmillan Cancer Relief nurses and patients from areas such as Drumchapel, which I visited recently, have raised the issue of outreach information with me. Will the minister and the Executive&#8212;perhaps through the Health Education Board for Scotland&#8212;consider establishing a rolling programme of outreach information, not just on diet and prevention of cancer, but on recognition of some cancers, leading to early diagnosis? I would like to know the minister's views on how that information might be distributed, whether it be by leaflets, a television campaign or whatever. The issue is important. We do not want to scare people, but we want to ensure that cancers that can be easily treated do not spread until they reach a point at which they cannot be treated.</p><p>I am pleased that the minister has announced a continuation of ring fencing, which many members have mentioned. The Macmillan nurses whom I met in Glasgow and Edinburgh were worried about the possibility that ring fencing would not continue. I am sure that they will be pleased to hear that it will continue.</p><p>I agree with Janis Hughes that some cancer treatments are becoming swifter, but I think that we should not shy away from recognising that others are not. In the Hairmyres hospital in her constituency, people are being treated more quickly, but other people suffering from lung cancer, for example, are not.</p><p>Colin Fox&#8212;who is no longer in the chamber, unfortunately&#8212;talked about the link between deprivation and cancer. We know that people in deprived areas are more likely to get lung cancer and are three times more likely to die of it than people in other areas. As I have said before, we must consider that issue.</p><p>As the minister said, we will have a debate on health on 18 September.

My first members' business debate, in the early months of the Parliament, was on that very subject. In that debate, I called for the creation of a Glasgow airport direct rail link in conjunction with a Glasgow north-south crossrail scheme.</p><p>It is correct that we are debating those issues again, as the contribution that our airports make to the economy is well established. Studies by the Fraser of Allander Institute revealed that Glasgow airport contributed &#163;709 million to the economy and supported 15,000 jobs&#8212;a much larger contribution than that made by Edinburgh airport.</p><p>I do not believe that it would be productive to become involved in a sterile Glasgow versus Edinburgh debate&#8212;such a debate would not be productive in the long run for either of those great cities. That is why my motion calls for investment in both airports, to enable them to reach their full potential. However, as a Glasgow MSP and a native Glaswegian, I believe that it is my duty to argue Glasgow's case.<place-holder colnum=\"1029\"/></p><p>There has long been a perception that there is a bias in Government and official circles in favour of Edinburgh, at Glasgow's expense. BAA Scotland's response to the Government's consultation document \"<em>The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom\" only added fuel to the fire of that perception.</em></p><p>The BAA response revealed that officials of the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Transport, Alistair Darling&#8212;who is the new Secretary of State for Scotland&#8212;got their sums badly wrong when they calculated that the development of Glasgow airport to hub status would cost &#163;1.3 billion. In fact, according to BAA figures, the cost would be &#163;1.1 billion.</p><p>In his new position as Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Darling has already warned officials at the Scotland Office to sharpen up their act. I say to Mr Darling that he still has a job to do with his officials at the Department for Transport. Apart from overestimating the figures for Glasgow, they underestimated the cost of developing Edinburgh airport. They said that the cost of upgrading Edinburgh airport would be a mere &#163;900 million&#8212;a figure that BAA has shown to be underestimated by &#163;400 million.</p><p>BAA's response identified several other areas in which the Department for Transport consultation got the figures badly wrong. On pavements and aprons, the department calculated &#163;232 million for Glasgow and &#163;159 million for Edinburgh. BAA assessed those figures and then produced its own figures of &#163;190 million for Glasgow and &#163;300 million for Edinburgh. On land costs for runway developments, BAA's response showed that significantly more expensive land around Edinburgh airport had not been taken into account. The department's consultants estimated &#163;27 million for Glasgow and &#163;18 million for Edinburgh, whereas BAA's figures were only &#163;20 million for Glasgow and &#163;110 million for Edinburgh.</p><p>In a similar way, estimates on road access costs, civil engineering and utilities were shown to be widely inaccurate. Glasgow airport's costs for civil engineering and utilities were overestimated by a whopping &#163;143 million, and for road access by &#163;96 million. Given the evidence that I have presented today, I believe that it is my duty, and that of other MSPs who represent the Glasgow area, to ensure that the case is made loud and clear for Glasgow to receive its fair share of investment.</p><p>A new factor has entered the equation. As I said, Alistair Darling has been appointed as Secretary of State for Scotland in addition to his responsibilities as Secretary of State for Transport. Mr Darling, an Edinburgh MP, is on record as saying that Scotland needed just one big airport; he is also the head of a Government department <place-holder colnum=\"1030\"/> that has already dismissed the case for developing Glasgow airport as a hub. In its response, BAA concluded that both airports met the Government's test for sustainability and that expansion in the manner outlined would ensure that Scotland's vital national airport infrastructure was secure into the future.</p>", "hdate": "2003-06-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13299390", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Airport Investment (Glasgow and Edinburgh)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Pauline McNeill for tendering apologies to me&#8212;she has another meeting to attend, but I thank her for her support in today's debate.

The care commission has admitted that it has not been able to follow through the system of inspections. That is unfortunate. Will the minister examine that issue? I believe that it is not enough to have two inspection visits&#8212;and even those visits are not always carried out at present. There should be more visits, especially unannounced ones.

As I and others have said in previous debates, we often hear only about the negative aspects of young people, so it is good to hear about their positive achievements.</p><p>We have all heard the old saying that labels stick. With young people, because of peer pressure, the label not only sticks, but things become worse&#8212;young people start to emulate the behaviour suggested by the label that they have been given. That is sad, especially when we consider that only 2 to 3 per cent of young people become offenders. It is sad that we give all young people the same label. I do not blame any one person, but I must single out some of the newspapers that make out that all young people are vandals. As I said, only a small percentage of young people commit crimes.</p><p>Campbell Martin said in his speech this morning that the vast majority of youngsters want what everyone in the chamber and outside wants&#8212;they want to be treated fairly and equally and they want to achieve their aspirations, just as we want to achieve our aspirations.

Every one of us was young once. I am sure that some of us&#8212;or most of us&#8212;got up to some kind of mischief in our lives. Perhaps we dressed strangely. Irene Oldfather mentioned that the Minister for Justice had pink hair and wore Doc Martens in her young days. I hope that Nicola Sturgeon will not be too mad at me if I reveal that, as I recall, at one stage in her life, although she did not have pink hair, she wore Doc Martens&#8212;perhaps it is something to do with <place-holder colnum=\"501\"/> justice.

That is a fact of life. They lost meeting places, some of them lost sports grounds and some lost assembly halls. I urge the Executive&#8212;if this is not the responsibility of the Executive, I will take it on board myself&#8212;to carry out an audit of the facilities that were available in those schools prior to PPPs and PFIs. I am not surprised, although others might be, at the lack of space and the lack of available rooms to hire in the new PPP schools. I ask the minister to respond to that issue when he sums up.</p><p>One concern that I have about the motion relates to sports facilities. Yes, it is all well and good to mention sports facilities&#8212;they are marvellous things&#8212;but we have to realise that we are losing sports facilities to developers hand over fist.

If the bridge is allowed to go ahead as proposed, ferries will not come right into Glasgow. That is a major worry.</p><p>I have spoken to businessmen and residents in the area, who fear that if the bridge is built as planned, it will mean the closure of the Clyde at that point. We are here to discuss the regeneration of the Clyde. We want to open up the Clyde not just as far as Inverclyde, but all the way up to Dalmarnock, so that the Clyde may be the jewel in the crown that it should be, not just for Glasgow, but for all of Scotland.

I congratulate Keith Harding on introducing the bill and on all the work that he and his assistants and researchers have done. I also thank him for coming along to the Local Government Committee to give coherent evidence and for allowing members to question him, sometimes quite ferociously, if I can use that word in this context.</p><p>Many members have picked up on the health issue, which is probably one of the most important. Young children are prey to the problem, but so are elderly people or those who may have an illness. Trish Godman outlined some of the illnesses that people can get from dog faeces. However, one of the problems of standing in dog faeces or getting it on one's hand is that the symptoms of a resulting infection might include headaches and aching limbs, and people often do not realise before it is too late just how serious those symptoms can be. I hope that the education that is proposed by the Executive and by Parliament will make people aware that touching dog faeces is very unhealthy.</p><p>I welcome the bill, but there are a couple of provisions in it on which I questioned Keith Harding and other witnesses. One was the enforcement issue, which other members have raised, particularly with regard to elderly people. I know that some people, including blind and partially sighted people, are exempt, but I worry about people who are elderly. Most elderly people do pick up after their dogs, but I hope that, if they cannot, enforcement officers will look on them kindly.</p><p>Another category of people that has not yet been mentioned is children under 16 years of age. I have some difficulty with the bill's provisions in that respect, as I mentioned in the committee. I hope that those children and their parents will not have a criminal record if they are persistent <place-holder colnum=\"17131\"/> offenders. I have been told by councils and by other committee members that the enforcement officers will be lenient, questioning children and taking them to their parents. However, we must beware of the enforcement issue with regard to elderly people and children under 16, and particularly children under eight. That is something that we must keep a careful eye on.</p><p>I was also concerned about the costs. I am sorry to bring up again points that I raised in the committee, but COSLA and councillors also raised the issue. The proposed cost is &#163;6,630 for 32 local authorities. I do not think that that will be enough, but I do not blame Keith Harding for that. I call on the Executive to provide more money for literature and education if councils want it. The Executive and the Parliament should look favourably on such requests. The proposed total works out at around &#163;207 per local authority, and that is really not enough.</p><p>The education issue is probably the most important, as all members have said. As a dog owner, I always take a bag and a poop-scoop, but I know how awkward it can be if my dog embarrasses me and I happen not to have a poop-scoop or bag. The first thing to do is to look for a piece of litter, on a tree or lying on the street, to wipe it up, but there is an embarrassment factor involved in that. Getting over that comes from education. I welcome the &#163;100,000 that the Executive has pledged for an education programme, and I welcome the bill, which I am sure will be enacted diligently.

I again congratulate Karen Gillon on securing it.</p><p>I am a Glaswegian who grew up with <em>The</em> <em>Herald </em>and the <em>Evening Times</em>, and I certainly remember the <em>Green Citizen</em>, which is no longer with us. Indeed, I remember <em>The</em> <em>Herald</em> when it was the <em>Glasgow Herald</em>. Since it lost \"Glasgow\" from its title, the newspaper has gone on to become one of the best newspapers&#8212;if not the best&#8212;in Scotland. I know that Mr Monteith will challenge that point.</p><p><em>The Herald</em> has become one of the best Scottish broadsheets because it consistently prints unbiased news, which is not something that many newspapers in this country do. That is why we must fight very hard to ensure that whoever takes over <em>The Herald</em> and the <em>Evening Times</em> lets the editorial staff and journalists speak with their current voice, not only for the people of Glasgow <place-holder colnum=\"16267\"/> but for the people of Scotland. We must watch the sale closely to ensure that the independence of the newspapers is not compromised in any way. I am sure that the Parliament will take that issue into account.</p><p>In Glasgow, the <em>Evening Times</em> is an institution. As Ian Jenkins pointed out, it was something to roll up in your pocket on a Saturday night, or to read on the subway or the bus. It was also handy for giving children a wee clip round the ear, which is something that I experienced. It is a very much-loved newspaper in Glasgow and beyond, because it speaks with the voice of the Glasgow people. People do not simply read the <em>Evening Times</em>; they also contribute to it. The fact that it is such a campaigning newspaper is another reason why I am worried about the sale, and why I ask the minister to take a careful look at it. I believe that Gannett is up front and honest and hope that the company will maintain the newspapers' independence. However, I will be watching what happens very carefully.</p><p>I should point out that Maggie's Centre was started through an <em>Evening Times</em> campaign. That shows that the editorial staff of the newspapers give their journalists the freedom to be unbiased, which is very difficult to find and very unusual in this day and age. Diversity is very precious to a democracy, and if we do not hold on to freedom, democracy and diversity in Scotland, we will have nothing at all.</p><p>Although I congratulate Gannett and hope that it takes over the newspaper, I must echo Karen Gillon's comments about the unions. Like most members, I have received letters from journalists on <em>The Scotsman</em> about the appalling practices that are used against them. All members in the chamber know exactly what I am talking about. As a result, we need to keep an eye on things and ensure that good work practices are adhered to.

We must make the point that, unlike many others, pensioners have few opportunities to increase their income without state help. Members have said that we are in a marvellous position in the union. I ask members, and urge them to ask their constituents, whether they could live on &#163;75 a week&#8212;I very much doubt that they could.

Some 58 per cent of Scottish pensioners have to spend 10 per cent of their income on ensuring that their house is heated adequately.

When I asked one of the witnesses whether people in other European countries ever died of hypothermia, they said that they did, but not in their own homes. It is terrible to admit that, in Scotland, people die of hypothermia in their own homes. We should examine that situation carefully. We should be ashamed of the fact that members are claiming that poverty does not exist. The Executive is trying to mix the figures.</p><p>I remind the Labour party that it was dragged, kicking and screaming, into supporting free personal care.

It is a terrible indictment that the Executive bowed to Westminster and gave back the money.</p><p>Doubts are emerging about how the Executive will meet its commitment to implement its proposals on free personal care.

As the minister said, it is important for tourism and industry. It is vital that investment should be made to develop international routes and to enhance accessibility of airports by improving transport links.</p><p>Glasgow airport has suffered from the lack of support from BAA and successive Governments. BAA has evidently prioritised its airports in the south-east of England, as has been stated by many members. The Executive has failed to show any vision, commitment or speedy action in putting in place the decent transport links that are required by Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.</p><p>The importance of rail links was highlighted in BAA's paper on rail strategy. It proudly lists lots of improvements in rail links to many of its airports <place-holder colnum=\"14523\"/> and I shall mention a few. The Heathrow express was launched in 1998 at a cost of &#163;500 million. There are now plans to extend that rail link at a further cost of &#163;150 million. The Gatwick express runs four times an hour, seven days a week. Stansted has one of the highest shares of rail access, at 27 per cent, and there are plans there for a new fleet of rolling stock and for investment in stations and infrastructure.</p><p>The BAA paper describes how Southampton is linked by excellent rail services to the local area and by an express route to London. Let us see what it says about Scotland. It proposes a mere 7 miles of rail links, which tells us how BAA has participated in the studies into the potential for rail access. That is shameful on the part of BAA. A lack of vision and investment on the part of BAA and the Government are responsible for the sorry situation. We still have no rail links to Glasgow or Edinburgh airports.</p><p>Now we have a proposal for a new so-called central airport&#8212;a hare-brained scheme for a super-duper airport costing God knows what and taking God knows how long to build. For Mr Mundell's information, it is a smokescreen to hide the fact that it is in BAA's interest, as Brian Adam mentioned, to push traffic through Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and ignore the needs of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. It might be all right for us if we want to pay extra air fares to fly from London, but our constituents either do not want to or cannot afford to. I say to Sarah Boyack&#8212;who is leaving the chamber&#8212;that it may be okay for her, but it is not okay for people in the rest of Scotland who wish to fly directly from Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness or wherever.

It is for that reason that I welcome the strategy to tackle the problem of coronary heart disease. The big question is whether the strategy will go far enough.</p><p>Deprivation has been identified as one of the key factors in creating the conditions in which heart disease and stroke flourish. The Scottish health statistics demonstrate a clear link between deprivation and the death rate from heart disease. It is unfortunate that the Scottish Parliament does not have the full powers to tackle the fundamental problem of deprivation. My colleague Nicola Sturgeon mentioned the reasons for that.

We must reverse the trends that have seen the number of obese six-year-olds double and the number of obese 15-year-olds treble in the past 10 years.</p><p>Good nutrition is paramount in the fight against coronary heart disease. It is crucial to improve our children's eating habits. They need to be educated at an early stage to become knowledgeable about nutrition and the benefits of good nutrition. It is also crucial that healthy eating is promoted in schools in place of the fatty snack foods that are commonly consumed at lunch and break times. Colin Campbell mentioned that.

As Trish Godman said, although they are largely in the background, we could not have completed such a large amount of work without them.</p><p>Trish Godman also pointed out that this could have been a flagship bill for the Parliament. Unfortunately, the exclusion of proportional representation and local councillors' remuneration means that we have missed a golden opportunity to pass a bill that could have encompassed all the good aspects of local government. However, I will speak to the areas that the bill covers.</p><p>The bill contains three main themes: best value; community planning; and the power of well-being. Iain Smith, Trish Godman and the minister have all mentioned best value. I am pleased that the minister has at least recognised that councils must be allowed to compete on a level playing field. It is absurd that councils will be restricted by legislation and guidance when other public agencies are not. How can councils go out into the big, bad world and compete against such bodies under such terms? If we are to work in partnership&#8212;to use a famous Labour party word&#8212;there must be common legislation and guidance. I ask the minister to consider the matter again.</p><p>On community planning, I endorse all the committee's recommendations on Communities Scotland. The minister's assurance that he will lodge new amendments on that part of the bill shows that he has at least taken heed of that section of the committee's report. As Trish Godman pointed out, community planning is an important part of the bill. Only yesterday, we were in my old hunting ground of Paisley, where I was a councillor. I will not bore the chamber with details of the 10 years that I spent there. We visited the town not to take evidence on the bill but to ask people for their thoughts on various aspects of local government. In the workshop group that I chaired, community planning was discussed in great detail. It touches everyone from the local authority to local people, and forms one of the bill's most basic aspects.</p><p>I am intrigued by some of the minister's remarks about co-operation among various agencies. Indeed, I asked the minister about that issue when he appeared before the committee. I want to know the extent to which the different bodies will co-operate. The minister also mentioned that there would be an announcement about community funding, and I look forward to hearing details of <place-holder colnum=\"14288\"/> that in his summing up.</p><p>I know that the minister is sympathetic to the idea of cross-cutting funding. After all, when I asked him about the matter, he replied:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I say&#8212;wearing my finance hat, rather than my local government hat&#8212;that we are already interested in some of those matters.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>Local Government Committee,</i> 25 June 2002; c 3153.]</p><p>I hope that the minister will follow through on that remark.

We know modernisation is needed and we welcome the &#163;700 million, but we do not believe that two accident and emergency hospitals are sufficient for Glasgow.</p><p>Much has been said about the consultation process. Greater Glasgow NHS Board spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on the so-called consultation process. It hired the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Hampden football ground and another football ground and it produced a video. What did we get from that process? We got the original proposals and a quotation from a document dated August 2000, which says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our aim is to create two adult Accident and Emergency Departments/Trauma Centres&#8212;at the GRI and on the Southside.\"</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of pounds were involved as well as hundreds of members of the public. Doctors, clinicians and nurses gave of their time. People have said that the consultation was a sham and I agree with them: it was a deliberate sham to present proposals that were presented originally in 1999-2000. We have not advanced one iota.</p><p>Transport links have been mentioned today. Gordon Jackson said that the hospitals were difficult to get to. I refer to the west end and the north of the city. I presume that some members have tried to get through the Clyde tunnel and city centre at peak times or at weekends. Believe me, even at off-peak times, the roads are congested and the tunnel is often closed or only one lane is open. We cannot afford to deal with people's lives under such conditions.</p><p>Two accident and emergency hospitals for Glasgow are not sufficient. That is why I support the motion.</p><p>The Glasgow royal infirmary is already under great pressure, as we all know. During the consultation process, doubts were raised about whether the GRI could cope with the projected number of patients it would receive. The consultants and nurses told the health board that they did not think they could cope. A letter that I received from west Glasgow hospitals says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The Health Board and Trust have yet to provide any sensible reasons for this plan or indeed any evidence that it is workable. Despite the lack of evidence neither the Board nor the Trust have ever seriously considered a proper option appraisal between one or two sites for North Glasgow.\"</p><p>That says it all. Hundreds of people have given of their time, as I said before, for the consultation process. What about the ACADs? It is insufficient to have an ACAD that is not attached to a hospital.

The amendment is a cop-out and would lead to the worst possible scenario, with Glasgow left in limbo for five years&#8212;and perhaps for a further five years after that. This is all about saving Lord Watson's skin and the Lib-Lab coalition in Glasgow. I am glad that I have said that. This is a cop-out. If any Glasgow MSP votes for the amendment, they will have to answer to the people of Glasgow.</p><p>I remind the minister that, if we close down hospitals in two years' time, and if we remove commitment, we will not get those hospitals back.

I ask the minister when we will get the 15-minute service back, because its absence is why we are all constantly delayed.

We must take control of the rail industry if we are to do justice to the people who have voted us into this Parliament.</p><p>Consider the record of successive Governments. First there was a right-wing Tory Government and now we have a right-wing Labour Government, in both Edinburgh and London. Neither can be proud of the transport system that it has introduced. Stability and investment have been required, but all that we have seen is fragmentation and underinvestment. Private profit has been put before public service.</p><p>Members will know that for some time I have been campaigning for the implementation of the Glasgow airport direct rail link and crossrail. My colleagues will mention other schemes, such as the Borders rail link. We desperately need those schemes to be implemented.</p><p>There is growing consensus in this country that the way forward is for the Parliament to assume complete responsibility for the rail network in Scotland. The Scottish Government should join that consensus. It should take the powers and <place-holder colnum=\"12882\"/> ensure that Scotland gets a fair deal in funding.</p><p>We must have control of the Scottish share of the Strategic Rail Authority moneys. I wrote a letter to the minister on 15 May, but unfortunately I have not received a reply. Malcolm Reed, the director of SPT, revealed that SPT has consistently been awarded approximately 50 per cent less per capita than each of the six passenger transport authorities in England. Scotland cannot afford to lose out on that cash. Let us consider a couple of examples. West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority, which serves a population of 2.5 million compared with the 2 million people in the SPT area, was awarded &#163;50 million for 2002-03; SPT was awarded &#163;28 million. In 2001-02, the WMPTA was awarded &#163;47 million and SPT was awarded &#163;16 million. Is that what the minister calls equality? I asked him that earlier. Is that fair or is it the price to be paid for having a Lib-Lab coalition that has no ambition?</p><p>If we had control of our railways and our finances, we could build the crossrail north-south link and many others. The Executive claims to be committed to tackling urban congestion, but it is failing to take the steps that would reduce congestion. Once again, the Lib-Lab coalition is strong on rhetoric and weak on action.

I hope that he accepts the amendment in the spirit in which it was intended&#8212;to try to hurry the project along. We are concerned and I am angry that we have debated the rail link so many times, yet nothing has come to fruition. I could go on and on about all the debates that we have had and reiterate the information, but I hope that the minister will take on board the new information about legislation that Robert Brown mentioned.</p><p>I said that I was angry. My reason for being so is that, although other airports are coming up, Glasgow airport is coming down. Flights are losing passengers because of the inaction of this Government and past Governments. Stansted airport was opened in 1991. Let us not forget that the Glasgow rail link was first mooted in the early 1990s. We are nearly in 2003 and there has been no movement whatsoever. In the early 1990s Stansted had 1,127,000 passengers and Glasgow had 4 million passengers, but Stansted got a rail link and we did not. Stansted's passenger numbers have risen by 17 per cent, but Glasgow's passenger numbers have risen by only 2.2 per cent.<place-holder colnum=\"12853\"/></p><p>Robert Brown mentioned regeneration, which was mentioned in the debate on local government earlier. If we want regeneration in not only the west of Scotland but the whole of Scotland, we have to push forward with the rail link. I would like the minister to clarify in his summing-up the statement that he made on 28 February. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I know that recent press reports have suggested that the Executive has already decided to express a preference for the construction of a link to Edinburgh airport rather than to Glasgow airport. I will take the opportunity that this debate offers me to say that that is not the case.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2002-02-28.9897.1\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 28 February 2002; c 9898.]</citation></p><p>A leaked report on the cities review states that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"there is no commitment in the review to either the vital cross-rail link or Glasgow airport links.\"</p><p>I would like that to be clarified. Although the cities review might contain some good news, if that is true, it is bad news. As the story has already been leaked to the press, I am sure that the minister will be able to give us an honest answer about whether the airport link will go ahead.</p><p>Many members want to speak in the debate, so I will not take long. The lack of action by the Executive and by previous Governments will eventually result in the demise of Glasgow airport and the demise of the west of Scotland. The SNP and, indeed, the Government cannot let that happen. The Scottish Parliament was elected by the Scottish people to represent the Scottish people and to show that we care for them. We must show that we care about all our cities.</p><p>As a Glasgow MSP, I am pushing Glasgow's case.

As far as I can see, we have only Trish Godman who opened the debate and Sylvia Jackson who will close it. Given that local government finance is important to everyone, not just to councillors or to local members of Parliament, I find it disgraceful that no Labour members will speak on the subject. The contempt that Labour has shown for local government is shocking, given the amount of work that Trish Godman, members of other parties and the committee staff have put into the report.

Like other cities, Glasgow is facing the loss of economic functions, poverty, area abandonment and the steady shift of the economically able and mobile population, which has a major impact on services such as health and education and on the remaining residents. As the base declines, social problems are concentrated while the fixed costs of service delivery remain constant. In cities such as Glasgow, where 60 per cent of residents live in regeneration areas, regeneration policies are crucial.</p><p>It is important that we address the problem of decline. Returning the right to retain the revenue that the city generates has been identified in the cities review as a key measure to aid regeneration. I am pleased that the cities review team recognised the problem and recommended that Glasgow retain a higher share of the business rates raised in the city.

Tory and Labour Governments cannot be proud of their record. Adrian Harnett is one of the specialists who recently resigned as a result of the crisis at Glasgow's Beatson centre. He accused politicians of always talking about wanting a world-class health service, but delivering the cheapest service that they could get away with.</p><p>Politicians have a duty to ensure that action replaces talking and fine words.

Some 52 of the 90 most deprived postcode areas in Scotland are in Glasgow. The incidence of cancer is higher in Glasgow than it is anywhere else in Scotland&#8212;if the Scottish average is taken to be 100, the incidence in Glasgow is 111.2 for men and 107.6 for women. Therefore, it was particularly distressing to follow the catalogue of problems at Glasgow's Beatson centre, which treats 60 per cent of Scotland's cancer sufferers. The centre seemed to go from crisis to crisis. Recently, it was also revealed that Scotland's only centre for eye cancer at Gartnavel hospital was under great pressure as a result of staff shortages. That was a knock-on effect of resignations at the Beatson.</p><p>I am grateful that measures are being taken and that there is some investment at last. However, the Executive must ask itself why it has taken so long to act when the warning signs have been clear for many years. We must end the scandal whereby up to half of Scotland's cancer patients do not get to see a cancer specialist. Statistics show that oncologists see only 25 per cent to 50 per cent of patients. We must end the scandal whereby sufferers from bowel cancer commence chemotherapy treatment within the standard eight weeks of surgery at only two out of 34 hospitals in Scotland. We must also end the scandal whereby only three out of 31 hospitals that were visited by the CSBS met the target of making a decision on initial treatment for lung cancer patients within four weeks of diagnosis.</p><p>The Executive must take action to end the postcode lottery that means that the length of time that cancer patients must wait for an MRI scan after diagnosis can vary from around seven weeks to a year, depending on where they live. It is a disgrace that, because there is a national shortage, health boards do not have enough trained staff.</p><p>We must provide sufficient specialist cancer doctors and more specialist nurses. The SNP's proposals, which Nicola Sturgeon announced today, would go a long way towards addressing the shortages. The Executive and the Labour party have promised much in respect of the health service, but the debate has shown that they have failed to deliver. We welcome anything, but action should have been taken much sooner.</p><p>The health service requires resources to bring it up to 21<sup>st</sup> century standards. There should be no spin or paper to cover the cracks of failed policies.<place-holder colnum=\"12505\"/></p><p>I said that the announcement of more moneys is welcome.

I will concentrate on people aged 50 and over, who also are deemed to be on the scrap heap. That includes me and quite a few folk here. As the convener of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on older people, age and aging, the issue raised in the motion has come up time and time again at our meetings. In fact, we received a comprehensive presentation by Lesley Hart on the issue.</p><p>The motion calls upon the Scottish Executive to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"identify and address areas of age discrimination in Scottish public life\".</p><p>I will concentrate on that point. The Scottish Parliament should be the first organisation to omit agism from its job application forms. I will provide a couple of examples of agism from Scottish Executive job application forms. Under the heading \"Age\", the first form states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the normal retirement age in the Scottish Executive is 60\".</p><p>Under \"Equal Opportunities\" it states that the Executive does not discriminate on the grounds of age, gender and so on. An updated Executive application form quotes the same phrase as before under the heading \"Age\". However, under \"Equal Opportunities\" the reference to age has been removed.</p><p>In my wisdom, I wrote to Angus MacKay, the then Minister for Finance and Local Government, asking for information on the Scottish Executive's recruitment policy and referring to the requirement to retire at 60. A new form of words has been added to Scottish Executive application forms:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"There are no specific age limits.

That is a marvellous and positive way in which to look at older people, if we can call folk over 50 older people.</p><p>I return to my earlier point about discrimination and the Scottish Executive's policy on working in this Parliament.

If we are to place this Parliament at the forefront of the issue&#8212;I see Hugh Henry laughing, but I am sure that he will give me a straightforward answer&#8212;why have we not taken up the European directive from November 2000 on a general framework for equal treatment in employment?

Housing in Scotland is an issue that merits the attention of the Parliament. Unlike Bill Aitken and other Conservative members, I think that the issue merits even more time because of the massive problems in all sectors of the housing stock and the appalling conditions in which some of our citizens have to live in the 21 <sup>st</sup> century. In particular, solutions are urgently required for the problems in the private sector. The scandal of people living in Dickensian conditions is undeniable. It is ridiculous that the Parliament oversees that situation. The task force's report highlights that issue, and I hope that the second report will consider some solutions.</p><p>I want to highlight houses in multiple occupation, which are normally referred to as HMOs. Johann Lamont mentioned the issue, but I would like to take it further. It is estimated that there are around 12,500 HMOs in Scotland. In Glasgow alone, the figure is almost 3,000. HMOs are the main choice for people who require affordable accommodation, such as young people, students and low earners. However, such people's need for low-cost housing means that many of them are forced to live in poor, and often extremely dangerous, conditions. Members will know of the case of the two students in Melrose Street, which was a terrible tragedy.</p><p>In October 2000, the HMO licensing scheme, which replaced the existing discretionary scheme, was introduced. Many people welcomed the licensing scheme as a step in the right direction of eradicating the appalling conditions that many people who live in HMOs must endure. However, I and others&#8212;I think that Johann Lamont highlighted the matter in the Social Justice Committee&#8212;have raised concerns about whether the legislation is being backed up by the resources that are necessary to make the system effective.

We do not need such speeches in the Parliament, especially when we are discussing care for the elderly.</p><p>Yesterday, at the cross-party group's annual general meeting, we had an interesting speaker from Ireland, Sylvia Meehan, who is the president of the Irish senior citizens parliament. Throughout her life she has championed equality, not for just women, but for elderly people. She talked about how Ireland is dealing with care and help for the elderly and is making elderly people more independent. She mentioned joined-up thinking between health services, hospitals and communities, so that elderly people can live their lives in relative security, in the knowledge that they have health services on their doorstep. I found that interesting. She also mentioned a helpline for elderly people.</p><p>What emerged from her speech and from a discussion that I had with her later was that the Irish Government funds all of that, without quibbles. The Irish senior citizens parliament was <place-holder colnum=\"10031\"/> pushing forward its ideals and the Government was listening. As we all know, Ireland is an independent nation. Is that why it has a different approach? It did not need to wait for permission from another Government to implement its proposals.

We will continue to do so, and to monitor any backsliding by the Executive on the implementation of free personal care. Sutherland enshrined the values of free personal care, for example that older people are an important part of society. Our approach to long-term care should be to enable older people to lead fulfilling lives, not only in care homes, as was mentioned before by Margaret Jamieson, but in their own homes, with personal care to back that up. That is an important point. The funding system for long-term care&#8212;which is what Mary Scanlon's motion is about&#8212;should provide opportunities for older people to lead their lives the way they want to. As politicians, we should listen to that.</p><p>It is important that there is unified and joint working. We should not keep quibbling about which local authority should be responsible. Older people&#8212;and I&#8212;do not care how it is done. We just want the money to be made available and for the health boards, local authorities and the Parliament to work together to ensure that care is delivered, regardless of whether it is delivered through a partnership&#8212;the buzzword&#8212;or whether it is unified. We must have joined-up working. As politicians, we have a duty to everyone in Scotland to ensure that every section of our society is treated fairly.

As I said, it is marvellous that, although those people suffer pain, they still involve themselves in so many other issues.</p><p>As Elaine Smith pointed out, the fact that chronic pain is debilitating is well documented. She also mentioned that other long-term acute illnesses are associated with chronic pain. That issue is not so well publicised, and it would be an excellent idea to publicise it more. Of course, chronic pain also leads to relationship break-ups, which are terrible, and to long-term unemployment, which can be debilitating not just to one's health but to one's state of mind. We must recognise and publicise the impact that long-term pain can have on the country's economy and on people's well-being.</p><p>Dorothy-Grace Elder's motion suggests that the Executive should get together with health boards and push chronic pain patients to the top of the agenda, and also highlights the dire shortage of <place-holder colnum=\"9763\"/> pain clinics and staff. I urge the minister to take those serious points on board. The Beatson clinic was mentioned earlier; Malcolm Chisholm intervened on that situation. I hope that, in her summing-up, the minister can give some hope to the many people in the gallery that she might take the same action. Health boards and trusts have been running the agenda for too long, and people have been suffering. I ask the minister to give us something positive and to tell us that she will push the issue up the health boards' agenda. I also hope that she will tell us that the Parliament, not the health boards, will run that agenda.</p>", "hdate": "2002-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13268340", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Chronic Pain"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I also congratulate Dorothy-Grace Elder on securing this excellent debate and thank the people who have turned up to listen to it.

New Labour's ideology is driven by Tory ideology. I am thinking particularly of PFI, or PPP, whichever way one wants to put it. I believe that those schemes will lead to further pressures on local government finance. The means of financing public services is wasteful and expensive. Every &#163;1 billion of PFI contracts will cost the public purse &#163;50 million more per year than borrowing through traditional public sector avenues would.

COSLA mentions in its report that 30 per cent of all the moneys that local authorities get, which amounts to &#163;6.6 billion over the next three years, comes with those strings attached. That is our concern.</p><p>The SNP, COSLA and local government are basically saying, \"For goodness sake, give us less interference from central Government, less ring fencing, and less Executive talk about pushing through its policies and priorities at the cost of local needs and local people.\" I wish that the minister would take that on board.

I do not need to read more reports. They give statistics, but the debate is about the suffering and worry that people go through when they have cancer. A member said yesterday that all of us probably know someone who has attended the Beatson. We should remind ourselves that the debate is about the people and the care that they should receive.</p><p>The staff have been mentioned. We must make clear the tremendous debt that we owe to the workers in the NHS. Daily, they demonstrate their loyal dedication to the health service, often working under extremely difficult conditions to service the health needs of the nation. However, the unfortunate reality is that our hard-working health service workers have not had the support that they deserve. The new Labour Government's custodianship has been a catalogue of failure and disasters. The failures are all too apparent to me, as a Glasgow MSP, and to other members.</p><p>The Government's record on the health service and on cancer services in particular is not one of which it can be proud. For too long, the Government has buried its head in the sand when <place-holder colnum=\"4790\"/> confronted by the problems that are faced by cancer services. Those problems are real and have been identified by patients and staff in the health service. That is not scaremongering, as Labour members often say. If the Government had taken those problems seriously, perhaps action would have been taken to solve them at a much earlier stage and the crisis at the Beatson might not have arisen.</p><p>I welcome the fact that, at long last, the minister and the Government have taken action to resolve the Beatson's problems by installing new management and removing the centre from the control of the North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust. However, questions must be asked. Why has it taken them so long to act when problems were identified&#8212;as has been stated&#8212;at a very early stage? The trust that mismanaged the Beatson was a creation of the new Labour Government.</p><p>As early as November 1999, Dr Nick Reed, the clinical director at the Beatson, identified the problems. The Beatson serves almost 3 million people in Scotland, but had only six radiotherapy machines when it required 12. As a result, patients waited up to nine weeks for treatment. Unfortunately, some patients had tumours that returned after six to eight weeks. That is a sad indictment of the mismanagement of the Beatson. At the time, the Scottish Executive said that it was aware of the problem, but it washed its hands of it by saying that the problem was purely a matter for the trust. I am glad that that has now been resolved.</p><p>The question remains: why has it taken until now to act when the Executive was aware that there was a problem over two years ago? I have spoken to staff at the Beatson and have been concerned about the problems that they face. The new site at Gartnavel has been welcomed, but only now has action been taken to speed up the transfer to the site. Problems remain, as Nicola Sturgeon highlighted in asking the minister about care in the south side. There are many doubts about whether the Executive's plans will result in the improvement that is required in Scotland's appalling cancer rates.</p><p>We all recognise that cancer requires the earliest possible diagnosis and treatment if a patient is to be cured. It is an absolute scandal that the situation at the Beatson has been allowed to continue and to deteriorate into the crisis that it is today.</p><p>Studies carried out at the Beatson have identified that cancers are becoming inoperable because of a lack of machines. A study identified that 29 cancer patients had to wait between 18 days and more than four months between diagnosis and their second CT scan. In this day <place-holder colnum=\"4791\"/> and age, that is not acceptable. Five hundred women suffering from breast cancer have now had their check-ups postponed for at least a year as a result of the staffing crisis at the Beatson. Patients who have been identified as low risk have had their appointments put back. I say to the minister that people could die if the crisis is not resolved.</p><p>The minister's announcements, and those of the Labour party, about new cash represent a drop in the ocean in comparison with the investment that is desperately needed for the treatment that is required in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Scotland is a wealthy country, but that is not apparent from the health treatment that is provided to our people. We can afford better standards of care. The Government must take steps to resolve the crisis at the Beatson and to give back confidence to the Beatson and cancer services throughout the country.</p>", "hdate": "2001-12-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13262584", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Cancer Services (West of Scotland)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When I came in, I picked up a copy of the report on the west of Scotland cancer service.

I also welcome Cathy Jamieson, the Minister for Education and Young People, who has a personal interest in Kincaidston Primary School in Ayrshire. I would also like to thank the many groups of the deaf community who have been extremely supportive in pushing for the debate, particularly Deaf Connections, the British Deaf Association and the Scottish Council on Deafness, whose support and information has been invaluable.</p><p>The debate has been long awaited by many people involved with the deaf community. It is my third attempt to debate the motion; I first lodged the motion in mid-2000. I am delighted that the motion has been taken for debate tonight. It is particularly timely as it is fewer than four weeks before the end of the European year of languages. The motion covers a range of issues on which many people have been campaigning for some considerable time.<place-holder colnum=\"4526\"/></p><p>My interest in the issues contained in the motion was first stimulated by my involvement in the millennium schools project. It was my great delight to take part in the project when Deaf Connections in Glasgow organised activities with St Brendan's Primary School in Yoker. The millennium schools project aimed to teach the basics of British Sign Language and deaf awareness to primary 7 classes in Glasgow. I was delighted when I heard that the project had been awarded a further three-year grant from the Community Fund and that it was to be extended to secondary schools both in and outside the Glasgow area.</p><p>The project sought to instil a greater knowledge, understanding and awareness of deaf people and their language in mainstream schools. As 90 per cent of deaf children are educated in mainstream schools, the introduction of BSL and deaf awareness programmes would enable deaf youngsters to feel more included in activities. That would set a solid foundation for the future, with more hearing people having some knowledge of sign language. It would help make Scotland a more inclusive society for those of us who are deaf. The deaf community would like BSL to be added to the school curriculum so that both deaf and hearing children can learn it at school.</p><p>A key issue for the deaf community is the shortage of sign language interpreters, lip-speakers and deaf-blind communicators. As more deaf and hard of hearing people leave school, the demand for communication services has become so great that it is outstripping supply. Deaf people find great difficulty in securing the services of interpreters. In Scotland there are only 37 qualified BSL interpreters. That represents a ratio of only one interpreter to 135 deaf people. Many in the deaf community believe that the recognition of BSL and its introduction to the school curriculum would be a tremendous step forward in alleviating the situation.</p><p>The European year of languages has been welcomed as an opportunity to celebrate linguistic diversity and to highlight the benefits of a multicultural, multilingual society. The deaf community has used the opportunity to increase awareness of one of the most significant minority languages&#8212;sign language. The British Deaf Association estimates that in Scotland there are about 7,000 people whose first or preferred language is BSL. In the UK as a whole, more people use BSL than use either Gaelic or Welsh. Many deaf people speak English only as a second or third language. Sign language is more accessible to deaf people than English, making it extremely important for BSL to be recognised.</p><p>The UK has now signed and ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The charter states that it is a basic <place-holder colnum=\"4527\"/> human right to use a minority language in private or public life. The deaf community would like information produced by local and central Government to be available in BSL format. Deaf groups such as the BDA have called for recognition of BSL under the charter, as that would ensure for the deaf community fuller access to public services, education, the justice system, broadcasting and cultural life. Recognition would also encourage study and research into BSL and would enhance its position as one of the UK's most widely used indigenous languages.</p><p>Last week we had a debate on audiology services, when we were informed that delivery was the responsibility of the health trusts. This week we have a real chance to deliver, as education is the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. I hope that the minister will take steps to help create a better future for the deaf community and will make some positive moves to demonstrate that the Scottish Parliament is making progress towards a more inclusive society.</p>", "hdate": "2001-12-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13261941", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: European Year of Languages (British Sign Language)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you.

For too long, audiology services and the deaf have been sorely neglected by Scottish society.</p><p>Mike Rumbles mentioned that people had written to MSPs; I am sure that, like me, he has a pile of correspondence. I received copies of questions that constituents had put to the Government, the latest of which is dated 23 November. One of the questions was about pilot schemes. As we all know, the answer given was that pilot schemes operate down south, in England. I ask the minister why schemes have not been set up in Scotland.</p><p>Another question concerned the central purchasing of digital hearing aids, which has already been mentioned. The answer that we received was that central purchasing has been possible since June 1999. Why is the option not being taken up? A third question concerned free digital hearing aids from the NHS. The answer that we received was that they were already available free. Why is that option not being taken up? Two speakers&#8212;Mike Rumbles got it right&#8212;indicated that the problem lies with health boards. That is a big problem.</p><p>When members from all parties lodge questions on this issue, the answer that they receive is always, \"It is up to each individual health board.\" I think that the Parliament must say to health boards, \"It is time that you gave out digital hearing aids. Go into bulk purchasing. Give them out free.\" In written answers Susan Deacon indicated that digital hearing aids are available free, that it is possible to bulk-buy and that pilot schemes are on-going. It is high time that we and the Executive told the NHS, \"It is time that you took your finger out and got on with it.

I would have preferred the Executive motion to have made some reference to that. Rather than containing just a</p><p class=\"indent\">\"commitment to work in partnership\"</p><p>with various groups and communities, the motion should also have contained a commitment to work in partnership with Westminster and the national asylum support service. I will return to that point.</p><p>I begin by thanking the many groups and ordinary citizens who have worked tirelessly in Sighthill and other areas of Glasgow to integrate the refugees into their community. If they had not highlighted publicly the injustices and unfairness of Westminster's dispersal system, we would not be here discussing once again the plight of asylum seekers. I thank those people, many of whom are voluntary workers, for all that they do.</p><p>I will concentrate on two issues: dispersal and the effects of dispersal. I will focus on the situation in Glasgow, because I am a Glasgow MSP and know the Glasgow area better than anywhere else. Glasgow has also taken in most of the refugees who have come to Scotland. The areas to which refugees have been dispersed in Glasgow&#8212;Sighthill, Castlemilk, the Gorbals, Maryhill and Scotstoun&#8212;have one thing in common: they are all areas of severe deprivation. As has been mentioned, no packages were put in place and there was no communication with communities. Glasgow City Council, to which several members have referred, was given little notice. I congratulate Brian O'Hara of the Asylum Support Project, based in Kelvinhaugh Street in Glasgow, on the hard work that his team does.</p><p>Like Paul Martin, I have received correspondence from various agencies and committees of Glasgow City Council. I will quote from a letter that I received from the Asylum Support Project, which will indicate why I think it essential that we contact NASS and Westminster. The letter tells us that the Home Office phoned the <place-holder colnum=\"3503\"/> council and pleaded that there was a crisis. It said that every bit of accommodation in the United Kingdom was full up and asked whether Glasgow could take some refugees. The letter states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We were asked to take one full coach\"&#8212;</p><p>which later became two full coaches&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a day starting from 15<sup>th</sup> December. We advised NASS that, in our opinion, the timing for this was not ideal, given the run up to Christmas, but we ultimately agreed to their request.\"</p><p>The letter continues:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In the main, NASS had not thought their process through and Asylum Seekers were sent to Glasgow without proper documentation and there were indeed initial problems with vouchers.\"</p><p>The letter indicates that Glasgow City Council has had problems with NASS.</p><p>My second point concerns the effects of dispersal. We have all heard about hundreds of people&#8212;people who are already frightened&#8212;arriving during the night, particularly in the Sighthill area. If we are to believe one tabloid newspaper, which I will not name, they were arriving in an area that was very hostile. It is to the credit of the people living in that area that they thought differently. They welcomed the refugees. The tabloid newspaper to which I refer should be ashamed of itself, as it did a lot of scaremongering and bad work. Members have already mentioned the media. Some of the remarks that have been made in the media are not welcome.</p><p>I want to be honest about this issue. If we are honest, we must admit that people have been dumped on communities. There was no consultation. No amenities were made available to the refugees and, more important, to the local people. There are empty halls in the areas that we are discussing. I have pleaded that those be opened up instead of being closed down. Community centres should be opened so that local people can use them.</p><p>The problem is that we need better consultation&#8212;not just with this Parliament and the local communities, but with Westminster and NASS. We must get them to work with us.

The first is the 3 per cent limit, the second is the requirement for consent by the constituent authority and the third is the requirement for ministerial consent.</p><p>The minister has said that the Executive will lodge an amendment at stage 2 to deal with the issue of constituent authority consent, and I welcome that. I have been a member of the Local Government Committee for only two weeks, but I know that it had considered the relevant documentation and debated the issues before I joined. The committee was happy that the minister had committed himself to lodging an amendment to the bill. I was even happier than other members, because I was concerned by what Iain Gray said in his letter to the committee of 11 September. In the final paragraph of that letter, he stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"a local authority would have to have made a conscious decision that it was willing to suffer a lower standard of policing or fire services than that enjoyed in neighbouring areas and to have spent the money thus saved elsewhere. Ultimately it would have been up to the electorate to decide whether they agreed with that order of priorities\".</p><p>I now do not have to write to Mr Gray to ask him to explain what he meant. He may say more about the matter in summing up, because I was <place-holder colnum=\"2982\"/> confused by the suggestion that politics should come into the police and fire services.</p><p>The issue of ministerial consent is more problematic. Mike Rumbles has already pointed out that we might have lost the isle of Arran if we had had to wait for ministerial consent. I did not want to raise that issue, because I thought that it might frighten people to death. Instead I will quote Councillor Hinds, whose comments are short and to the point. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The difficulty is the bureaucracy of the system.\"</p><p>That is right. The councillor continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"If the Scottish Parliament is about nothing else it is about trust and devolving power and resources. That is the principle of the matter.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Local Government Committee</em>, 4 September 2001, c 2144.]</p><p>I hope that the minister will reconsider that issue. I am sure that the Local Government Committee will do so.</p><p>The other issue that I mentioned was the 3 per cent limit. After being questioned by the committee, representatives of COSLA and the fire and police boards appeared to agree that they would accept the 3 per cent limit if that was the only of ensuring that the bill was passed. However, they felt that the same limit was not imposed on councils and that it amounted to a form of capping. Others have also raised the issue of the 3 per cent limit. Along with ministerial consent, that is the only contentious matter remaining in the bill.</p><p>The bill is sensible and I am happy to support it at stage 1. We know that a variety of amendments will be lodged at stage 2, but, on the whole, it is a sensible bill. It was crazy that police or fire services could have been prevented from carrying out their duties simply because a council would not give them money.

I am glad that they have seen the light.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm, who was previously convener of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on older people, age and aging, will know just how vociferous that group can be. As the present convener of the group, I would like to report what has been said to me about the implementation of the proposals. To begin with, members of the group were delighted. However, when they saw the recommendation from Westminster that, although this is supposed to be a grown-up Parliament, Scottish people will not be allowed to have an attendance allowance, the phone calls started to come in. I will not repeat half the words that were said to me down the phone&#8212;this is not the appropriate place to do that. However, members will gather that the people with whom I spoke were not at all happy with the situation. We should not go to Westminster cap in hand. We should make it clear that its response is a slap in the face of this Parliament. We are being been told that this is not a grown-up Parliament and that people do not deserve an attendance allowance from a fund into which they have paid for many years.</p><p>I will quote from someone whom Labour members will all know&#8212;Jim Devine, who is Scottish organiser for the health union Unison. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our generation owe a debt to these people.</p><p>They were the ones who campaigned for the welfare <place-holder colnum=\"2889\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">state, created the welfare state and contributed to the welfare state all their lives.\"</p><p>Exactly. We should not be too complacent. We should not pat ourselves on the back when Westminster is still saying that it holds all the power and that it will tell us what to do. That is a disgrace.</p><p>I have another question for Malcolm Chisholm on the care development group's report. Page vi of the executive summary states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We have assumed that Attendance Allowance will continue to be paid as a contribution towards personal care costs for people in care homes.\"</p><p>Was the care development group given assurances that that would be the case? I am sure that all its recommendations were made in the best faith, as I know that all the members of the group are hard-working people. However, the Parliament should know whether the group was given assurances on that point.</p><p>Christine Grahame touched on the fact that attendance allowances and the costs of care for the elderly are different in different areas. The care development group suggests &#163;145 per week for personal care. It says that that is the national average, but in seven local authorities in Scotland the average residential home charge is higher than the national average. That needs to be considered. Forty per cent of those in Scotland who fund their residential home care privately live in areas where the average weekly charge is higher than the national average. For those people, personal care would not necessarily be entirely free. We also need to consider older people who are in nursing homes.</p><p>Although we welcome the report and are prepared to give the Executive half a pat on the back, we must say to Westminster that this is a Scottish Parliament, that we will deliver free personal care for elderly people and that it cannot tell us what to do. The people who voted for a Scottish Parliament deserve better. We should tell Westminster to stop being so petty with our people and our money.

I hope that the minister will look at that. Members have discussed where lottery money is going&#8212;into sport in schools, cancer care and child care. As members have said, those are all good causes. That is true, but should not those projects be funded by national money rather than propped up by lottery funding?</p><p>I will dare to mention the &#163;5 billion of lost lottery funding. In essence, that loss means that projects may fall and that in other cases, as Mary Scanlon mentioned, it will be impossible to do long-term planning. We must get away from the assumption that we can give money to good causes on a hit-and-miss basis. What will happen to lottery funding next year? Will it fall yet again? We cannot prop up Government policies through lottery funding.</p><p>I want to mention the criteria that are used to decide on lottery funding for projects.

All those communities, and many others, want to improve their facilities and yet community centres, swimming pools and schools are being closed down. If local people and their young children are to be encouraged to use their schools, sports facilities and community centres, they should be encouraged to apply for lottery funding, but they cannot get that funding because the projects for which they want it do not match the criteria. That issue has been raised by various members. I hope that the minister will consider it.</p><p>I welcome any funding at all, but we should not use lottery money to prop up Government policies.

The Parliament should listen to everyone's views and I hope that all members will listen to these views, which are not only from constituents but from care workers who work in the homes.

That means facing the fact that everything is not well&#8212;if members will excuse the pun&#8212;in the health service. We must take many further steps to develop the services that the Scottish people need.</p><p>I would like to refer to many sections in \"Our National Health\", but I do not have the time. I am sure that someone will pick up on section 3, which refers to funding of services that are provided to <place-holder colnum=\"110\"/> more than one NHS area. I look forward to scrutinising that issue further when other proposals are made after March.</p><p>I am especially interested in the plight of the homeless in accessing medical care. I do not think that any member discussed that in detail, although the minister touched on it. That is an important aspect of the NHS in Scotland. Every day&#8212;especially during such weather as we are experiencing&#8212;people out there suffer and cannot access information or care from the medical profession. We must address that.</p><p>I noted the minister's comments about the voluntary and professional agencies&#8212;particularly the initiative in Edinburgh and various agencies in Glasgow&#8212;that deal with homeless people, sometimes in difficult circumstances. That is an onerous task, and I congratulate those agencies. The lack of up-to-date data on the health of homeless people does not make the task easier. I acknowledge the work of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which has done a marvellous job in tracking aspects of homeless people's experience of health care in the 1990s. Those data are a wee bit out of date, so we should update them.</p><p>Section 2 of \"Our National Health\" contains patter that mentions a health and homeless co-ordinator. I welcome that idea, but there is just a mention of it. The first part of the document refers to NHS hospitals; I look forward to scrutinising those proposals and getting back to the minister on them. The proposals and relevant action that I hope will accompany the plan should give people&#8212;whether a family or a single person&#8212;who have no permanent home access to medical services.</p><p>I stress the plight of the single homeless. In my opinion and in the opinion of professionals, they are the most vulnerable people. They cannot access help. They are folk without any support. I ask the minister to consider that carefully. Those people are slipping through the net. I do not want to give any figures. I am sure that some exist, but the data are pretty out of date. Even in the current weather, the single homeless have no access to information, and access is important. They need to be able to access medical care, whether they have a serious medical problem or something that we might not consider serious, such as a need for dental care. Toothache may not be serious but, on a cold day, it may seem just as serious as other medical problems.</p><p>I received a letter from councillors in Renfrewshire who say that they are establishing a one-stop shop. I congratulate them on that and I will study the initiative closely. Perhaps the minister could contact Renfrewshire Council and see the good work that it proposes to do.<place-holder colnum=\"111\"/></p><p>We must be honest with one another, look deeply into the issues and admit that all is not well with the health service for everyone and particularly for homeless people. We do not have current figures. The figures that are available on the number of homeless households, rough sleepers and hostel and night service users are all estimates. A chief aspect of the health plan must be to obtain up-to-date figures on which to base work.</p><p>There is ample evidence that single homeless people have poorer physical health than the rest of the population in Scotland. Some researchers, including some from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, have argued that the key threat to single homeless people is inadequate access to health care services. We must rectify that situation. I have a couple of suggestions. It would help if we advertised the agencies and provided information in areas that rough sleepers and the single homeless frequent. It would also help if we collected up-to-date data. I look forward to the minister's reply on how that can be co-ordinated. We must act sooner rather than later. I ask the minister to please take that on board.</p>", "hdate": "2001-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20158255", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Primary Care"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not particularly congratulate the minister, although she has provided fine glossy documents that are thick, heavy and compact.

Perhaps folk who are near my age will remember this. I remember getting the ferry from Govan to go on school trips to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. I wonder how many people know that the only place they can see the inside of a honeycomb is at that museum. I am not talking about an artsy-fartsy museum and art gallery&#8212;it is a good old-fashioned museum and gallery in which school kids can participate.</p><p>The beauty of Glasgow's museums is that they are diverse. As Mike Watson said, there is the People's Palace and the Kelvingrove, but there is also the Burrell collection; there is something for everyone.</p><p>I will take up Pauline McNeill's point&#8212;what exactly do we want to get from this motion? I think that we want fairness and equity. Edinburgh has three nationally funded galleries. Galleries in the south of England, such as the Tate Gallery, are nationally funded. In Glasgow, none is nationally funded; that is the crux of the problem. I hope that the Executive can give us some answers on this.</p><p>People talk about Glasgow having problems, but what city does not have problems and what city does not have museums? Dundee has problems, but it also has excellent museums; the McManus Galleries in Dundee is excellent. As far as I am concerned, Glasgow is the first city&#8212;not the second&#8212;in Scotland, so its museums should be nationally funded. In Glasgow, we cannot afford to continue to charge council tax payers to keep the museums running. I do not usually praise the council, but it does a marvellous job with the museums. As Robert Brown mentioned, artefacts sometimes languish because there is not time to find out exactly what is in storage&#8212;and an audit has not been done&#8212;and to exhibit them.</p><p>On the whole, the museums have moved with the times. For example, the Kelvingrove moved with the times by introducing a cafeteria area in which new pictures are put up every so often. The public can tick off which picture they would like to be hung in that area. The picture that gets the most ticks is hung there: it is a people's museum.</p><p>Glasgow deserves better, so I hope that the minister will tell us that Glasgow should and will get national status for its museums. In Glasgow, we have never charged for people to enter museums. As Janis Hughes rightly said, the Government in Westminster announced yesterday <place-holder colnum=\"561\"/> that 17&#8212;not all of them, but 17&#8212;national galleries in the greater London area and Manchester will no longer charge, yet Glasgow museums get more visitors than the science museum in Manchester.

Enactment of the bill would mean that homelessness through mortgage default would decrease. There were 1,200 applicants for housing in such circumstances in 1998-99.

It would change the way in which mortgages were looked at. People would be properly notified and their circumstances considered by a sheriff. For once, people would be heard&#8212;the bill would provide for a fair and honourable way to go about that. If a landlord defaulted on a mortgage but did not notify the tenant, that tenant would now be notified, were the bill to be enacted.</p><p>I ask Margaret Curran to comment on funding. I know that the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has been involved in the bill. Bill Aitken also mentioned the Edinburgh agencies. I ask ministers to consider carefully the funding of those agencies and to ensure that they are adequately resourced. Citizens advice bureaux and other agencies are the first port of call for many people; if we do not fund them properly, we will fail the very people whom we are trying to help with the bill.<place-holder colnum=\"252\"/></p><p>Many members have mentioned disruption to families who are made homeless because they are unable to pay their mortgages. We all know that that can happen to anybody. Any one of us could lose our job or fall ill. Anything could happen&#8212;every member of society is affected by the problem. The principles and resulting legislation of any bill must be about delivery.

Something must be done about it.</p><p>Why do women&#8212;young and old&#8212;drink over the limit? Why do they drink constantly and abuse their health and that of the people around them?

That child cannot tell parents, teachers or their friends about what is happening at home. The child might under perform at school. Who can they go to? They cannot cope. They are frightened to bring their friends home because one of their parents might be drunk. What sort of future does that offer young children? We have those problems in Scotland and we must tackle them.</p><p>Many people lose their jobs through abuse of alcohol. Consider the people who lose their houses through alcohol abuse.

Where is our share of the &#163;CAPut!' billion&#8212;&#163;1.9 billion, as Tommy rightly said? Does the minister intend to ask John Prescott for that money to fund a light rail system? Previously I asked the minister about the &#163;1.88 billion that John Prescott had allocated for transport. What representations have been made to him for money to fund crossrail and the airport link?</p><p>People in Glasgow and Scotland are crying out for this proposal. It would regenerate not only the heart of Glasgow, but areas such as Maryhill and Easterhouse, connecting them to the heart of the city. As we know, not everyone lives in the heart of the city. Glasgow is made up not only of Glaswegians who live in the city centre, but of thousands of people who live further out. They need affordable access to the city, which they are not getting at present. If members go to George Square, they will see that it is chock-a-block with bus lanes. I do not dislike buses, but there are so many of them on the streets of Glasgow that they have started to take precedence over all other forms of transport.</p><p>I ask the minister seriously to consider investigating this proposal.

Crossrail is the collective name that is applied to the north-south rail route across Glasgow, to the Tron line, which is an existing freight line, and to a short section of new track from West Street to link up with the East Kilbride, Barrhead and Cathcart circle lines.</p><p>The link has been on the drawing board, believe <place-holder colnum=\"63\"/> it or not, since 1968. I shall give members a brief history. In 1968, the greater Glasgow transport study recommended completion of the line, which required 200 yd of new track at High Street-Bell Street, to connect with existing freight lines. In 1974, British Rail, in conjunction with the local authorities, applied to the Scottish Office to proceed with those recommended projects. In 1975, the Scottish Office refused to go ahead with the crossrail.</p><p>In 1991, the completion of Glasgow's north-south missing link was once again revived by Strathclyde Region, enhanced by an additional link from Paisley at West Street. A new Partick-style interchange was proposed for West Street and for Glasgow Cross. In 1995, a provisional parliamentary order was applied for for the crossrail scheme, indicating the seriousness of plans to proceed with the scheme. All members can count, so they will have worked out that it is more than 30 years since the crossrail was first mooted, yet nothing at all has been done about it.</p><p>More specific crossrail proposals are on the table, but various transport authorities seem to have put it on the back burner. The shadow strategic rail authority has already offered grant aid towards the &#163;10 million cost. A similar offer has already been accepted for Edinburgh's &#163;9 million crossrail project. Why was Glasgow not considered and why is it being left out?</p><p>Let us look at what the crossrail proposals would entail. There would be a connection between High Street-Bell Street and the existing freight lines. That could be up and running in 18 months and would allow all north Glasgow suburban electric trains to run directly on to Paisley, Ayr, Largs, Gourock and Wemyss Bay. The estimated cost of such a project is &#163;10 million. That is a very small cost as far as I am concerned.</p><p>The second phase of the scheme would link up with Cathcart, Neilston, Kings Park, East Kilbride and Barrhead. Those places could also be linked into Glasgow airport, which I shall talk about in more detail later. The airport link could be completed as a third phase of the project. The latest figures for the whole crossrail project estimate the cost at &#163;100 million. Compared with the &#163;2 billion cost of the Jubilee line, I do not think that that is an awful lot of money.</p><p>What would the crossrail mean for us? Cross-city travel would be enhanced. New interchange stations would be constructed at West Street and High Street, which would increase the number of trips and involve only one simple interchange. It would also provide work for construction workers and help to regenerate the area. City centre access would be enhanced, with new stations providing easy access to High Street, Queen Street and Charing Cross. A new station at <place-holder colnum=\"64\"/> Glasgow Cross would provide enhanced access from the rail network. The Glasgow Cross building, which is very old, was offered to the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive in 1996 for the princely sum of &#163;1 on condition that it be made into a rail station.</p><p>I have already mentioned social and economic regeneration. Much of the east and south of the city has become run down and neglected. In many areas, the buildings are derelict. I lodged the motion for this debate because many local residents and traders have written to me asking when the scheme is going to get off the ground. A new station at Glasgow Cross would regenerate the whole area, particularly the east end of Glasgow. It would open up the area not only to local travel but to long-distance travel.</p><p>Having covered the crossrail link, I shall go on to talk about what I call the missing link&#8212;the Glasgow airport link&#8212;which would complement the crossrail proposal. It would enable services to access the airport from the north and west of Glasgow via Springburn, and would link to Edinburgh, Stirling, Aberdeen and beyond. It is a fantastic project, but I do not understand why it never seems to get off the ground. It was first mooted in 1990, with serious proposals first being submitted in 1995. A site has been identified and Railtrack's 2000 network management statement for Scotland details that a rail link to Glasgow airport would cost around &#163;60 million.</p><p>Strathclyde Passenger Transport and Railtrack have developed a feasibility study and the Scottish Executive has commissioned consultants to carry out a rail access study. We should favour this proposal. Why do we need the link? It is vital to the economic regeneration not only of Glasgow, but of the surrounding areas and, indeed, of the whole of Scotland.</p><p>A study carried out in 1997 by the Association of European Airlines indicated that any airport with 2 million passengers should consider a rail link and that any airport with 3 million passengers should have a rail link. Glasgow has 6.4 million passengers, but to date nothing has been done. In 1991, a rail link to Stansted airport was completed. At that time, Stansted had 1 million passengers. Now, it has 11 million. Last year its passenger lists rose by 17 per cent, while Glasgow's increased by just 2 per cent. It is vital that Glasgow is allowed to compete on equal terms. We want Glasgow to flourish.</p><p>I have put forward my arguments as well and as sincerely as I can. I hope that the Executive will take these plans on board and take all the necessary steps to ensure that they come to fruition. As I have already said, &#163;2 billion was spent on the rail link down south. Why cannot we in Glasgow and Scotland access moneys? Like <place-holder colnum=\"65\"/> everyone else in Britain, we pay taxes. We should be entitled to get that money back.</p><p>This link is essential, as we do not want to be left behind. I ask the minister to consider the proposal carefully and to give me her answer.</p>", "hdate": "2000-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13238466", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Rail Infrastructure (Glasgow and West Coast)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will not repeat my comments, other than to thank the MSPs and members of the public who have stayed behind to listen to the debate.

Karen Whitefield mentioned the promotion of community empowerment, community control and community ownership. At the moment, more than 90,000 houses are in council ownership in Glasgow. Some 13,000 of those will be demolished. I want to know where the tenants of those houses will go. Like many Glasgow MSPs, I have been around the country, and Glasgow in particular, to meet tenants and go to public meetings. The tenants are terrified that they will be scattered to the four winds. Cathie Craigie mentioned Queen's Cross Housing Association in the Maryhill area. Tenants in that area would love to go to Queen's Cross. Will the minister give us a guarantee that those communities will not be torn apart and that the residents will be allowed to live in a community with improved houses if the stock transfer goes ahead? The minister is shaking her head at me, but I wish that she or someone else from the Executive had turned up at the public meetings to offer that guarantee. When we talked to housing associations, we were told that they could not take those houses over.

If we get that guarantee today, perhaps some of those tenants will be happier.</p><p>I want to talk about local councillors' responsibilities. Will there be genuine liaison between councillors and tenants in the huge organisation that is proposed? As members who have been councillors will realise, councillors find it difficult to get anything out of Scottish Homes or housing associations regarding tenancies or anti-social tenants. It was easier when councils controlled the homes. Will the minister assure us that liaison will be guaranteed? The Executive has set up executive councils in other areas to ensure that councillors are not involved in outside bodies, so why will this situation be different?</p><p>On empowerment, where is the plan B that will come into effect if the tenants vote no?

I listened to the minister's speech and to those from the back benches, and, quite honestly, I thought that they were advertisements for buses. There was absolutely no mention of anything else.</p><p>The minister said in her opening remarks that buses should be people's first choice. Well, bus lanes are fine in appropriate areas and at appropriate times, but they are not the be-all and end-all of Scotland's transport system. We cannot travel everywhere on a bus; subways and trains are involved as well.</p><p>In case the minister has forgotten, I remind her that buses also cause pollution and congestion. When she sums up, perhaps she can answer a question about the document, \"Travel Choices for Scotland\", which was endorsed by the First Minister. Why did she not use that document to call for an integrated transport system? She is saying that we should take the cars off the road to get rid of congestion, but we will never do that without a proper integrated transport system. The bill does not address that problem. All it says is <place-holder colnum=\"305\"/> how to get on and off a bus.</p><p>Sarah Boyack mentioned the possibility of Henry McLeish publishing some sort of document. I will believe it when I see it. There is no mention in the bill of plans to implement schemes that are vital to Scotland's transport system. There is no mention, for example, of the M74 extension, of the Glasgow airport link or of the Glasgow north-south crossrail scheme. Why are those schemes not mentioned? The plans exist, and some of them have been costed. All that is missing is the commitment of ministers. The bill has been published without the Executive involving itself in plans for those important parts of the transport system in Scotland.</p><p>The crossrail scheme was investigated and talked about away back in the 1960s. It was on the drawing board, it had been costed and people had put in bids for it. In the Westminster Parliament, speeches on the Crossrail Bill indicated that there was a serious intention to proceed with the scheme&#8212;but nothing has been done since 1995. Why? The crossrail scheme would get rid of practically all the congestion in Glasgow city centre and would open up deprived areas of the city, north, south and west, to businesses and consumers, making life easier for residents in those areas.</p><p>The Glasgow airport link is a necessity if we are to compete in the modern world, but nothing has been said about that project. There has been no movement towards implementing those plans. Stansted airport had a direct airport link in 1991. In the past year, its passenger volume has risen by 29.4 per cent, carrying 11 million passengers. At Glasgow airport, passenger volume has risen by just 2.2 per cent. Does not that say it all?</p><p>It is not just buses we want. Of course we want more buses, but we also want a better transport system. We want a transport bill for Scotland, not a local authority bill. Kenny MacAskill said that we are going to Westminster with a begging bowl, but John Prescott has the money we need. Let us look at what Westminster has spent taxpayers' money on. Billions of pounds have been spent on the Jubilee line in London. We pay for that. We pay for the Thames bridge, and it is not even working properly yet. We also pay for the millennium dome and for Portcullis House.

Was it not the River Clyde that provided transport and employment for the people of Glasgow and those from outwith its boundaries? Without the Clyde, this great city would not survive, but over the years it has been sorely neglected. The blame for that must be laid, fairly and squarely, on successive Tory and Labour Governments. The Labour council in Glasgow cannot escape blame either, as for many years, through incompetence and sheer neglect, the waterfront was left to rot, and was not developed.</p><p>I know that we are now talking about development on the Clyde, but I want to expand on this point. Although there have been various developments and plans in recent years, they have been piecemeal and they have done little for local communities. Unfortunately, most of the regeneration in Glasgow has taken place in the city centre and has neglected deprived inner-city areas and the peripheral schemes. For example, the Gorbals regeneration scheme did little for local people; the benefits went to house builders and businesses.</p><p>Glasgow City Council carried out a plan review in 1998. It noted that the River Clyde corridor is a key development location and that a rejuvenated river is one of the top 10 physical challenges. However, the detail on how to achieve development is very scant in the review. Glasgow needs a clear and coherent plan for regeneration. One of the keys to regeneration must be redevelopment of the riverside. The Clyde waterfront must be opened up and developed for the benefit of all our citizens. It must become an amenity. I welcome the plans of Clyde Port Authority and others. The Clyde must become an amenity that will be treasured by our citizens for generations.</p><p>Planning must not be driven purely by market forces. Strategic planning in the interests of local communities and the entire city must drive the plans for regeneration. Local communities must be involved and consulted.</p><p>The key to regeneration is public investment. We need more public investment in this great city. We know that there is money for such investment&#8212;Gordon Brown has billions in his war chest, which was recently boosted by the mobile phone franchise windfall. Without a share of that <place-holder colnum=\"678\"/> cash, Glasgow cannot flourish. I ask the Executive to ask Gordon Brown to open his war chest and release money to Glasgow. Glasgow has kept Scotland going for many years and we need and deserve some of that money.</p><p>To Glasgow City Council and Alex Mosson, the lord provost, I say that they should get it right this time.

Local councils must be democratically accountable to local people if they are delivering local services.</p><p>The way in which local government finance is delivered goes to the very heart of what people expect from local government, and it needs desperately to be reviewed.

It is important because we must have transparency and accountability in the Scottish Parliament. The people of Scotland expect and deserve no less.</p><p>Furthermore, in the light of recent events in the chamber, it is important that MSPs are seen to treat each other with the utmost respect at all times. If that does not happen, how can we expect the people of Scotland to respect the Scottish Parliament and its members?</p><p>My experience as a councillor brought home to me the importance of having clear and concise guidelines&#8212;I am sure that other former councillors will raise that point. In local government, it was often difficult to ascertain what constituted an interest or a gift. Often there was a lack of clarity in guidelines on declaring such matters. Indeed, for many years, the Scottish National party and other political parties made representations to the Nolan committee about those matters and called for clear guidelines to be put in place.</p><p>I welcome the guidelines, and in particular those concerning gifts, interests and sponsorships. Compared with council guidelines, they are clear and concise.</p><p>I will offer the chamber a brief example of the problems that I encountered as a local councillor. I remember that my daughter was once given a box of creme eggs&#8212;I will not say who made the creme eggs&#8212;which was certainly not worth more than &#163;250, and my spouse was given flowers and so on. Although that may seem trivial to members now, such gifts caused much consternation to me and to council staff. We had to decide whether I had to register the fact that I had received a creme egg, a box of chocolates or whatever. I know that other councillors experienced such difficulties, so I welcome the requirement to declare gifts that are worth more than &#163;250.

I hope that members read the amendment carefully and support it.</p><p>Although I agree with what was said about the problem of alcohol abuse, I believe that we should be under no illusions about the seriousness of the drug problem that we face in Scotland, particularly in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.</p><p>Many experts have pointed to the link between deprivation and drug misuse, as Karen Whitefield said. It is evident that many young people from the worst housing schemes in our cities&#8212;particularly Glasgow&#8212;have no hope and no prospects and eventually turn to drugs. We have all seen the recent reports of the deprivation in Glasgow. I make no apologies for mentioning Glasgow. I go along with Johann Lamont's suggestion that the Glasgow MSPs and the Executive should get together to present Glasgow as a special case.</p><p>There are compelling reasons to believe that deprivation has contributed to the grim statistics, including the 146 drug-related deaths reported by Strathclyde police. Only yesterday, we saw the problems that drug misuse can cause families: a heroin-addicted couple were convicted at the High Court in Glasgow for the terrible neglect of a young child. That is just one example of the misery that drugs cause, not only for addicts, but for their families.</p><p>As I said, Glasgow has a major problem with drugs. In 1990, there were an estimated 8,500 drug injectors in greater Glasgow; it is believed that there are now more than that. Research has also found that 40 per cent of 15 to 16-year-olds in greater Glasgow have tried illegal drugs. The majority of addicts are under the age of 30. That is what concerns me most&#8212;young people's lives are being snuffed out because of drugs. That is a major problem in Glasgow and we need the facilities to attack it. I hope that the Executive will respond to that. It was also found that those admitted to hospital for drug misuse were 30 times more likely to come from deprived areas of the city, which again demonstrates the link between drug misuse and deprivation.</p><p>Research has found that drug injectors in Glasgow spend an estimated &#163;160 million annually on drugs. That spending is financed mainly by crime&#8212;from the sale of stolen goods and drug dealing. A recent survey of 168 injectors in greater Glasgow found that they committed an average of 26 offences per month each. Strathclyde police have also identified a strong correlation between drugs and house-breaking.</p><p>The misuse of drugs has a devastating effect. It is a major contributory factor in crime&#8212;the front page of <i>The Herald</i> yesterday carried a report on attacks on the elderly. We all suffer, not just the drug abusers and their families. Whole <place-holder colnum=\"375\"/> communities suffer.</p><p>The cost of keeping the estimated 1,000 drug misusers from the Glasgow area in prison is approximately &#163;26 million a year. It is clear that, as well as causing misery for thousands, drug misuse is a major drain on public resources.</p><p>The creation of the Scottish drugs enforcement agency and the moves to improve drugs education and awareness are welcomed by everyone, I assume, in the chamber. However, we must create real jobs and real opportunities for young people. It is our duty to restore hope to those communities where all people have is despair. I hope that the Executive will take that on board.

Although it is clear that those problems are experienced by all sections of the community, I believe that among our ethnic minority communities housing problems are especially severe. Patricia Ferguson touched on that at the end of her speech. I hope that she and colleagues from all parties will join me in being particularly concerned about the extension of the right to buy in housing associations. That and the massive stock transfer that is proposed for Glasgow are a particular worry of mine.</p><p>We in Scotland take pride in being an open and inclusive society. Newcomers to Scotland have always been welcomed. However, we must recognise that all too often the experience of people in the ethnic minority community has not been happy. Research has shown that the ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from gross overcrowding, substandard housing, insecurity because of racial harassment and growing isolation. Their elders, in particular, suffer from alienation because of their culture. Because of discrimination in the public and private rented sectors, owner occupation has often been the only option for black people, although they are often able to afford only the very worst housing.</p><p>A Commission for Racial Equality survey found that in Glasgow 83 per cent of black households live in owner-occupied accommodation in substantial need of repair. They experience poor living conditions and are unable to finance repairs. Modernisation is an absolute impossibility and <place-holder colnum=\"168\"/> they suffer from severe overcrowding. Research carried out by the University of Stirling, also with Glasgow's ethnic minority community, shows that overcrowding and homelessness among the black and ethnic minority communities is 15 times greater than it was 10 years ago.</p><p>According to the 1991 census, members of the ethnic minority community were three times more likely to suffer from overcrowding than their white counterparts. I want to give an example of that, although I will try to keep it as short as I can. It will give members an idea of how some people have to live. The example is that of a widow in Glasgow's ethnic minority community. She is on social security. Her 23-year-old daughter is in a wheelchair and her 19-year-old son is crippled. She also has a 16-year-old son. Since 1987, they have lived in a two-up, one-bedroom, private rented insecure tenancy.</p><p>The oldest son sleeps in the kitchen; the rest of the family shares the bedroom. The woman receives no social services support and is unable to leave her family alone for any time. She rarely leaves the house at all. In May 1992&#8212;nearly 8 years ago&#8212;she applied for housing association housing. She was told that there was no possibility of the association's being able to rehouse her family in the immediate or short term, and that it would, in fact, be a miracle if a suitable flat became available. What chance do those people have of being rehoused if the right to buy is extended? I ask the minister to consider that.</p><p>It is vital that the problems of ethnic minorities are properly addressed. A major obstacle to dealing with those problems is the lack of statistics.

I think that we just saw a fine example: Johann Lamont, with her socialist background, trying to stick up for new Labour policies&#8212;I congratulate her on doing that so well.</p><p>We have already heard about the problems faced by the elderly because of fuel poverty. It must be recognised that a major contributory <place-holder colnum=\"1161\"/> factor to fuel poverty is the imposition of standing charges by the utility companies. The Scottish National party believes that removing standing charges for electricity, gas and telephone bills would enhance pensioners' lives and give them a higher standard of living. It may be that that is a reserved matter, but as members of the Parliament, MSPs take on board everything that our constituents and the pensioners up in the visitors gallery say to us. If we had the will, we could go to Westminster and suggest that the standing charges should be abolished.</p><p>The plight of the poor was highlighted in a report by the Consumers Association, which said that the poor were suffering from the severe tactics of the gas and electricity companies, with gas suppliers cutting off 30,000 homes last year. For the elderly in Scotland, living on pensions of only &#163;66.25 for a single person or &#163;106.70 for a couple&#8212;one of the lowest pensions in Europe&#8212;standing charges are a major burden. That is evident from the tragic statistics&#8212;there were 2,200 excess deaths of people over the age of 60 in Scotland in the winter of 1997-98. We should not allow that to happen in a civilised society. It is obvious that there is a particular problem in Scotland that must be addressed.</p><p>There is no reason why Scotland should not follow the example of Ireland, where standing charges for pensioners have been abolished. If Scottish pensioners did not have to pay standing charges, but paid only for the fuel that they had used, it would go some way towards alleviating the problem of fuel poverty in our elderly population.</p><p>Research reveals that poor pensioners are less likely to own a telephone than better-off pensioners. In 1996-97, 12 per cent of single pensioners and 3 per cent of pensioner couples, who were mainly dependent on state pensions, had no telephone at all. Furthermore, single pensioners who were mainly dependent on state benefits were three times more likely not to have a telephone than single pensioners who had greater access to income, and 10 times more likely not to have a telephone than couples who had greater access to income.</p><p>It would greatly enhance pensioners' quality of life if standing charges were abolished and they had to pay only for the telephone calls that they actually made. It is clear that the current system of standing charges penalises the poorest and most vulnerable people, and especially the elderly. What is required from the Government is action. If Ireland can abolish standing charges, I do not see why we cannot.</p><p>We have heard many fine words from those on the Labour benches. We have not heard anything about Gordon Brown sitting on his &#163;12 billion war chest. What about that? Why not release some of <place-holder colnum=\"1162\"/> that money for the pensioners?</p><p>Words from the Executive do not heat homes, and do not buy food to put on the table. What is required is action. Removing standing charges now would be a step in the right direction.</p>", "hdate": "1999-12-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13216155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Introduction"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wondered when the consensus politics was going to end.

I firmly believe that our amendment strengthens the motion, and I ask the minister to accept it. It also addresses some of the concerns that have been mentioned during the debate.</p><p>There should be a seamless approach to child care from the time before the child starts school. In many instances, that is not the case. I will speak about top-slicing, as Brian Monteith did, but I will come at it from a different angle. We know that the Government allocates &#163;1,175 to schools for every school place, but each local authority has a different type of top-slicing. Glasgow City Council top-slices &#163;250 from that figure, leaving &#163;925 per place. City of Edinburgh Council top-slices only &#163;134, leaving &#163;1,041. North Lanarkshire top-slices &#163;242, leaving &#163;933. South Lanarkshire, however, top-slices the same amount as Glasgow does. My point is that that causes confusion for providers that deal with different authorities. I would like the minister to address that and perhaps put a strategy in place to allow all local authorities to work together.</p><p>Training is a related issue. Top-sliced money goes to training and, while some local authorities with staff who are on placements from other local authorities are flexible and will pay for training in the local authority where the nursery is based, others insist that the teachers are sent to the local authority that they came from. That means that the member of staff is not at work for two or three days and the nursery must pay the travel costs.</p><p>A further problem is payment. Many providers have come to me to discuss local authorities that make late payments. I hate to say this, but Glasgow is probably one of the worst. At the moment, there are people in the Glasgow area who have not been paid since August.</p><p>Glasgow City Council received some of the funding from the Scottish Office, but it has not paid it out. That has meant that the nurseries are in debt. People are telling me that they are practically closing down, as they have had to arrange overdrafts with their banks. I would like the Executive to consider that and determine whether something can be done to help those nurseries. It is important to them and to child development that <place-holder colnum=\"643\"/> people use those nurseries.</p><p>As I said, I hoped that the Executive would take our amendment on board.

I tried to find out as much as possible about that and I would like the minister to answer these points.</p><p>The first is about the technology used in Trident. We know that the problem with nuclear weapons communications systems is made more difficult because it utilises millions of \"embedded systems\", that is, lots of little microchips and microprocessors that have been recycled.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"These embedded chips are a particular problem for the military. In order to keep the costs down the military have used '<i>commercial-off-the-shelf'</i> chips (COTS) that are generic and may have time and/or date functions embedded within them\".</p><p>That is a particular worry.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"In addition there is no general method for assessing Y2K compliance of software, chips or microprocessors therefore every system must be checked line by line and chip by chip in order to ensure compliance\".</p><p>That will be a mammoth task.</p><p>I again quote from the facts and figures I have gathered.<place-holder colnum=\"534\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"As of January this year only ten out of one hundred and twenty-five NATO Mission Critical Systems were thought to be Y2K compliant. Of the rest, 29 were not compliant, 4 were under investigation and of the remaining 82 nothing was known.\"</p><p>That is very worrying. I would like answers on that.</p><p>There is also an issue of staff availability. We know that the programme has slipped from a target date of January 1999 to December 1999. That is worrying. Again I quote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A '<i>Deterrent Millennium Task Group</i>' was established to ensure the British Trident system is Y2K compliant but the MoD are not able to say how many people are working on the issue or how much it will cost because there '<i>is no separately identifiable central record'</i>. The job of the Deterrent Task Group is to check 'the missile, the warhead, fire control, navigation, targeting' and other 'associated shore based facilities'.\"</p><p>In September 1998 the MOD review went on to state that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the MoD might need to delay or stop activities/projects while attention and resources are focussed on Y2K\",</p><p>that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"some systems might need to be abandoned in the short term pending resolution of the problem\"</p><p>and that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Shortage of skilled in-house staff is being identified as a potential risk to the programme in some areas\".</p><p>Taskforce 2000 described the Ministry of Defence as being one of nine high-risk departments. The MOD has admitted that the findings of the report are correct.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Taskforce 2000 have correctly recognised the scale of the problem facing the Ministry of Defence and the capability of our programme managers.\"</p><p>That refers to staff shortages, and I would like the minister to comment on that matter.</p><p>Let us look at possible consequences. It is extremely unlikely that a missile will be launched. I am not saying that anything like that could happen, but we could have a situation similar to one that has already arisen, which I will tell members about.</p><p>In 1993, the North American Aerospace Defence Command&#8212;NORAD&#8212;simulated a test out of curiosity. Technicians rolled the dates up to 1 January 2000 and the result was a total system blackout. That is a fact. I do not wish to scaremonger, but this is an important debate and that story is relevant. Trident is sitting on our shores, yet neither the minister nor anyone else has commented on the potential effects that the date change could have.

During the school holidays, it was a nightmare to find something for them to do. At that time, there were no activities for children. That is when I first got involved with the voluntary sector. I went to the citizens advice bureau and they told me where to go. Along with several other mothers, I set up a summer play scheme. We ran the play scheme very successfully for many years.

I want to ensure that local councils receive adequate funding to support local voluntary organisations.</p><p>Another worry is the advent of the private finance initiative in schools, about which the local press has been vocal.

Mike Watson&#8212;or Lord Watson&#8212;is not in the chamber at the moment, but I agree with most of what he said. Glasgow City Council carried out a case study that mentioned that 10 of the poorest areas of the city are excluded from the proposed objective 2 areas. Those areas include Pennilee, Castlemilk&#8212;which Lord Watson mentioned&#8212;Govanhill, Dennistoun North and Dennistoun South, Glasgow West, North Maryhill, Shettleston and Carmyle.</p><p>Those areas of deprivation have been removed from the objective 2 map but are in the worst 10 per cent of areas in Scotland. The Department of Trade and Industry has said that, based on their need, they should be included. Why have they not been included?</p><p>I would like to mention joined-up thinking and continuity. Dennistoun, Cardonald and Mount Vernon are areas of opportunity for business parks, for example, and they have been excluded. Why? Broomhill, Summerston, Mount Vernon, Pennilee, Cardonald, Castlemilk and Newlands are included as assisted areas, but will not receive structural funds. There is no joined-up thinking in relation to structural funding in Mr McConnell's programme.</p><p>We are all supposedly fighting for our areas&#8212;as we were elected to do. I am fighting for the Glasgow area, but I would like to point out that the SNP feels that the Scottish people have been hard done by because of the way in which the map has been drawn up and presented. I put it to Mr McConnell and the Executive that they and successive Westminster Governments have pulled the wool over the eyes of the Scottish people, who have been told that they are getting extra money when they are not.</p><p>We are the only oil-producing nation in Europe and we must go cap in hand to Europe and Westminster to ask for money that is rightfully ours. That is the case that the SNP makes&#8212;a case that must be put to the Scottish people.

I am not saying that we, or local councils, should take over the running of those organisations, as was implied in some speeches. The minister has reiterated that that is not what the compact states.

I hope that we have learned a lesson from that.<place-holder colnum=\"195\"/></p><p>Both emotional and financial resources are desperately needed. Local authorities fund women's aid groups; perhaps the Parliament could consider ring-fencing local authority funding for this purpose. </p><p>We cannot impose such a change, but we could perhaps recommend to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that the funding could be ring-fenced. That way, women's aid projects could go ahead on a long-term basis, which would give them continuity and security, and women who approach the organisations would have something to hang onto. They would know that the organisations will still be there in two or three years' time. </p><p>The second approach is a long-term education strategy, through schools and homes. We must introduce something like a good citizenship scheme into schools, to teach boys and girls to see each other as equal partners. I would like that on the curriculum. It would go a good way towards getting people to treat each other equally. It may take a number of years-women have had to endure violence for centuries-but we must tackle it for this generation and for future generations. I congratulate Maureen on raising this important subject. </p>", "hdate": "1999-09-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13209745", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Domestic Violence"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I wish to thank Maureen for initiating this debate, and to thank you, Mr Deputy Presiding Officer, for extending the debate.
