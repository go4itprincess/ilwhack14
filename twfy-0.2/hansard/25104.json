It is fair to say that, if there were a simple solution to it, we would probably have arrived at it by now. Nonetheless, I hope to offer some suggestions of how we might tackle new psychoactive substances.</p><p>I noted the report that the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee produced in December, which spoke about there being an epidemic of new psychoactive substances and outlined a range of points on which the select committee wanted the Home Office&#8212;because, obviously, it has the powers on drugs law&#8212;to take action. I am sure that the Scottish Government will be consulted at all times during that process.</p><p>My colleague Graeme Dey mentioned head shops. He was correct to highlight that there is a difficulty in cracking down on such shops, but I recently noted reports in the Aberdeen Evening Express of action that Police Scotland took against at least one of those premises in the city of Aberdeen. There are a number of such premises in Aberdeen, including at least one in my constituency.</p><p>As has been identified, the difficulty is that some, but not all, of the substances to which we are referring are often found within, or are predominant components of, items that can be purchased legally in other ways. Therefore, simply to ban the chemical compound would not necessarily solve the problem and may lead to other problems in other areas. It is not quite as simple as banning a certain chemical compound, because that can have a knock-on effect on items that are perfectly legally available already. To come on to where Parliament perhaps has some legislative competence on the issue, we need to consider whether regulation can be put in place, particularly through licensing legislation.</p><p>The other aspect, besides the argument about banning chemical compounds, is the paraphernalia that head shops sell. As others have said, although what they sell is probably more commonly associated with use of illegal drugs, it also includes paraphernalia that could&#8212;I emphasise &#8220;could&#8221;&#8212;be used for legitimate purposes.</p><p>Perhaps considering whether licensing legislation could be applied to such premises or the products that are sold in them might allow greater scrutiny of their operations, much tighter controls by the police and more regular visits by the police and trading standards officers without the need for tip-offs on activity, or other leads to follow. It would be part of the normal licensing renewal regime.</p><p>That would also allow the opportunity to consider whether burdens could be placed on the distributors of the products&#8212;for example, a requirement to ensure that they are confident that a product that they are selling will be used responsibly. When we license people to sell alcohol, we assume that they will take the necessary steps to ensure that the people who purchase alcohol are of the correct age to purchase alcohol and that they will not distribute that alcohol to people who are underage once they have purchased it. Such elements could be built into legislation. I hope that the minister will consider that.</p><p>A more difficult issue is online sales, which my colleague, Willie Coffey, and Claire Baker mentioned. This is not a new issue, nor is it unique to the problem that we are discussing. As Claire Baker and Alison McInnes rightly identified, it will require that work be done locally, around these islands and across the international stage in Europe and beyond.</p><p>It is worth taking the opportunity to apply pressure to internet service providers to ensure that they think about how that content is accessed. Willie Coffey spoke about the fact that such websites are blocked on his server. Other servers might not have that safeguard in place, and controls might need to be applied by the user. Again, we need to think about that and determine whether pressure can be applied to internet service providers to ensure that they think about how they regulate the content that is being made available to the people who sign up to their service.</p><p>We also need to be cognisant of the impact and role of social media. We must be cognisant not just of the welcome role that they will play in promotion of the Scottish Government&#8217;s message or how they have brought together people who are concerned about the issue&#8212;as in Arbroath, as was highlighted by Graeme Dey and Alex Johnstone&#8212;but of how they are used to promote and share information on new psychoactive substances and where and how they can be obtained. We need to examine how that is being done and think about applying pressure to social media providers to ensure that they are aware that their sites are being used in that way, and to suggest to them that they need to think about how they regulate the content that is being uploaded to their forums.</p><p>Work is being done in the north-east with schools, the police and local authorities working together to raise awareness. We have to ensure that we are vigilant throughout the process. There is a fine balance to be struck between raising awareness of the dangers and avoiding raising awareness of the availability. That also needs to be factored in.</p><p>There is cross-party consensus on the issue, which is welcome. If we work together, we will reach some form of resolution.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22884031", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: New Psychoactive Substances"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As other members have said, the issue is complex.

The minister was indeed correct when she said that these are Glasgow&#8217;s games, but they are also Scotland&#8217;s games, so we must ensure that people across the country have the opportunity to get involved and be enthused before, during and after the games.</p><p>In the build-up to London 2012, Aberdeen hosted the Cameroon Olympic team as part of its pre-games training camp. That created a buzz in the city for many whose only association with Cameroon in sport had been the Roger Milla shuffle at the 1990 world cup. At the same time as the athletes warmed to the city, the city warmed to the athletes. Idrissa Adam, the 100m sprinter, took part in a local event with athletes at Aberdeen sports village. The women&#8217;s football team played a friendly against the Scottish women&#8217;s team as part of its build-up to the games. The city was abuzz; there was a real enthusiasm among the people. I hope that, ahead of Glasgow 2014, Aberdeen City Council will again look to host a training camp for a Commonwealth team, because that would help to create a similar buzz, enthusiasm and participation.</p><p>A number of events are taking place in Aberdeen that will help to create that enthusiasm in advance of the games. I learned about an event just recently that is taking place in my constituency: the Oldmachar Commonwealth games, which are being organised by Middleton Park primary school. The games will involve the five primary schools from the Oldmachar academy associated schools group&#8212;Danestone, Middleton Park, Forehill, Glashieburn and Greenbrae&#8212;and 525 pupils across primary 4 to 7 will receive 240 quality hours of sports coaching to build skills, confidence and enthusiasm to empower them to compete in the games, which are taking place at the sports village in June. Pupils will compete across a range of events and they will have their own torch parade. On 6 February, Clyde, the Commonwealth games mascot, will launch the event at Middleton Park school. The school has received &#163;6,624 funding from Celebrate to help it to host the games, and I look forward to that wonderful event taking place.</p><p>We are also seeing the development of sports hubs across the country. The first disability sports hub in Scotland was launched at the Aberdeen sports village. It provides support and advice for disabled individuals&#8212;people with physical, sensory and learning disabilities&#8212;and offers them, their families and friends opportunities to participate in a variety of activities that are suitable for all ages and abilities. That is a wonderful part of the legacy of sport. We should not forget that we were all inspired by the efforts of the paralympians at London 2012, and the use of the disability sports hub emphasises further that sport is for everyone and not just the able bodied. The Beacon centre in my constituency will soon be developed as a sports hub, too, and I look forward to that taking place.</p><p>The sports village is also offering a Commonwealth sports tour project. That will involve 400 pupils from primary 4 to secondary 2 taking part in a 10-week programme of one-hour sessions. It will allow our children to engage in and get a flavour of 10 different Commonwealth sports. That is good because, as other members have highlighted, the PE curriculum does not necessarily allow children to get a proper flavour of some of the sports opportunities that are available. Young people who may have an aptitude for a specific sport may find that that cannot be offered to them as part of their regular PE sessions, so such opportunities to try out different sports&#8212;sports that they might not otherwise engage in&#8212;may result in them finding a sport with which they click.</p><p>The legacy activity is also important for sustaining interest beyond the games. From a constituency perspective, I noted that Quarryhill primary school has been successful in bidding for legacy funding to develop its playground space to increase physical activity and boost active play and PE. That is welcome. Such projects will take place throughout Scotland, which emphasises the point that, although Glasgow bid for and won the games&#8212;I absolutely accept that&#8212;we want the benefits of the games to be spread throughout the country in their aftermath.</p><p>The minister mentioned street soccer. My understanding is that the sessions in Aberdeen have been extremely well attended. Street soccer, midnight football and similar events are always popular with young people. I am sure that that, too, will help to boost activity and participation.</p><p>Volunteers have also been mentioned. I chose not to volunteer for the games largely because my family does not see enough of me as it is, but I congratulate Mr Mason on being a volunteer. I am sure that he will prove to be most useful to people who visit Glasgow for the games. A friend of mine who is a medical student is going to be a volunteer doctor at the games. Not many people might have been aware that that role was offered as a volunteering opportunity. It is an excellent way to get people involved in volunteering for the games.</p><p>We should not lose sight of the fact that sporting events will take place throughout the year. In Aberdeen, there will be a Scotland v England women&#8217;s rugby international and the Commonwealth water polo championships will take place at the new aquatics centre that is being developed there. A one-day cricket international, which I am sure will enthuse Liz Smith, will take place in Aberdeen. The Queen&#8217;s baton relay will also visit the city.</p><p>As well as that, I was pleased to see further investment in an artificial football pitch&#8212;or multi-use pitch, as they are now known&#8212;for Dyce in my constituency, which will be jointly funded by the Scottish Government&#8217;s cashback scheme and Aberdeen City Council.</p><p>All those developments and events taking place mean that, although Aberdeen is three hours away from Glasgow&#8212;I hope that people who visit the games will also take the opportunity to come up to Aberdeen and see what we have to offer after they have been to Edinburgh&#8212;it does not feel remote from the Commonwealth games but feels part of them. We want to encourage all areas of Scotland to feel that they are a part of the Commonwealth games.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22870557", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Commonwealth Games and Legacy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I might pass on the run, Presiding Officer.

Other members on the SNP benches have done that as well.</p><p>The difficulty that I have with the way in which the debate is framed&#8212;this is why I was struck by the approach that Mr Henry took&#8212;is that, too often, we hear from the Opposition cries of, &#8220;You&#8217;re being complacent&#8221; when things are going well and cries of, &#8220;Everything&#8217;s in crisis&#8221; when things need to be improved. The reality tends to be in neither of those extremities.</p><p>We entirely understand that, in a human organisation such as the national health service, there will always be areas that need to be improved. With the volume of patients who are seen each day, things will sometimes go wrong. We all get constituents coming to our surgeries to tell us of individual circumstances in which things have not gone to the high standards to which we aspire. The big danger that we may fall into is to take individual cases and try to describe them as the norm and as what is happening elsewhere in the national health service. That is not something that is recognised by the health professionals to whom I speak when I raise constituency concerns in my area.</p><p>I want to touch on dentistry, which has not been mentioned in the debate. Indeed, it is not mentioned much in health debates. We can see the improvements that have taken place in that area since the Government came into office. I recall, prior to the 2007 election, the queues round the block in the town of my birth&#8212;Inverurie in the north-east of Scotland&#8212;and many other north-east communities as people sought to gain access to NHS dentistry. However, since 2006, across Scotland, there has been a 32.6 per cent increase in the number of NHS general dental services registered dentists. That is 793 additional dentists since 2006.</p><p>As a result, the waiting lists for NHS dentistry in Grampian have plummeted and the number of people who are waiting to access NHS dentistry is almost at zero. That is due to the additional NHS practices that have opened up in the city of Aberdeen&#8212;I cite Dyce in my constituency as having a new dentist in the community that is accepting NHS patients&#8212;but I suspect that it is also down to the Aberdeen dental school, which was opened in 2009 by this SNP Government. I recall that, at the time, the Liberal Democrats doubted the potential of that facility to eradicate dental waiting lists in the NHS Grampian area. Mike Rumbles said that it would not remove the waiting list problems. I note that it is not just NHS dental waiting lists that have been virtually eradicated in the north-east of Scotland since that bold statement was made by Mike Rumbles; it is also the Liberal Democrats.</p><p>As always with the NHS, the issue is about choices, and it is about parties laying out the choices that they would make. In every budget, the Government lays out the choices that it is making in relation to the national health service, and my colleagues will know that, at every meeting of the Health and Sport Committee at which the budget was discussed, I raised the question of disinvestment versus additional investment. When I raised that with Mr Findlay, he said that that is what he wants a review for. He wants a review to tell him how the NHS money should be spent.

His remarks and his quotation of Danny Alexander fall some way short of the guarantee that I would seek that the block grant will not be touched. He is right to say that how Mr Swinney chooses to spend the block grant is a matter for Mr Swinney. We need only look at the recent episode regarding public sector pensions, whereby the cabinet secretary was sent a letter from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury that made it clear in no uncertain terms that, if he pursued a different approach on public sector pensions, he would see the block grant reduced on a pound-for-pound basis.

The point is that if we use the revenues that the policy would generate to underpin, guarantee and fund that policy in the longer term, that is a critical element of the argument about the policy. We cannot deliver the one without having the other available to us to fund it. That is why the argument that the Deputy First Minister makes is critical to the debate.</p><p>I sound a note of caution to the Labour Party on its enthusiasm for the use of consequentials.

During the budget scrutiny process, I was a member of the Health and Sport Committee and we looked at preventative spend as part of our budget scrutiny. There are two key areas that would merit further examination, on which the cabinet secretary may be able to respond in his closing comments. The first of those is how preventative spend is being modelled and monitored by public bodies. The allied health professionals said that they feel that there is a lack of an evidence base in relation to their sectors, although the Royal College of Nursing highlighted work that is under way on a pan-UK level through the Office for Public Management. I would be interested to know from the cabinet secretary whether the Scottish Government has been able to feed into that or see the work that is being done.</p><p>The second question, which relates to how we ensure that we get the best out of preventative spend, concerns the fact that the people who spend the money are not necessarily the people who derive the benefit from that spend. Sometimes, I feel that there can be a reluctance on the part of some public bodies to say that they will make significant preventative spending decisions because it might not be their area that would derive the benefit. For example, a preventative spend in education might deliver a significant future saving not in education but in criminal justice. We need to ensure that such issues are being borne in mind and that silo thinking does not creep into the preventative spending agenda.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, it is not.

It has a personal note for me, as many of the children in my family spent time in neonatal care because of premature birth.</p><p>In March this year, I attended the launch by the Friends of the Special Nursery at Aberdeen neonatal unit of the miracles and memories scrapbooks project, which aims to bring together pictures and stories from people and families who have experienced the care and support of the Aberdeen special nursery.</p><p>One of the mothers, Julia Ann Roberts, commented to me that the neonatal care has led to a community spirit among the parents who have experienced prematurity and the care of the neonatal unit. Many of them are now dedicated fundraisers who work extremely hard to raise money to support the work of the special nursery.</p><p>One of my constituents, Donna Scott, petitioned the Parliament on the subject of donor breast milk and the establishment of a donor milk bank to cover all of Scotland. I am delighted that she was successful in achieving that aim with the support of the Scottish Government and the national health service. We now have a system in which, regardless of geography, premature babies can access donor breast milk, which as we know is vital for many premature babies.</p><p>Donna Scott and other parents who have been in contact with me have made a point about the number of beds that are available in units, particularly in Aberdeen. One point that has been brought to me frequently is about the number of mothers who have to be relocated to Ninewells in Dundee. They could not fault the care that they received there but, as Rhoda Grant highlighted, the geographical displacement causes obvious difficulties, particularly for the wider family, who want to visit and support the mother and child during what is a difficult time.</p><p>Another interesting point is about parental leave, although I realise that that is not devolved to the Parliament. Many fathers have only two weeks of statutory leave, but if a child is in a neonatal unit for a number of weeks, that leave can often be eaten up during time when the child is not at home. The mother&#8217;s maternity leave is also eaten into by the time that the child spends in the neonatal unit.</p><p>One of my constituents, Wendy Eastell, told me that, when her daughter was born prematurely at 27 weeks, she had 24 weeks of maternity leave. One week of that was spent in labour and 11 weeks were spent while her daughter was in the neonatal unit, which meant that she had only 12 weeks at home with her daughter before she had to return to work. At that point, her daughter was only term plus 11 weeks and weighed only five pounds. There can also be difficulties for mothers with breastfeeding and attachment if they do not have that vital time with their baby because it is spent largely in the neonatal unit.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I have a couple of other constituent examples that I would like to raise, so I ask you to be a little flexible with my time so that I can at least put them on the record. A number of people have contacted me. I will not be able to raise all their points, but I have told them that I will send their comments to the minister after the debate.</p><p>One example is my constituent Alison Martin, whose daughter Sawyer was born six weeks prematurely. Alison said that the staff at the neonatal unit in Aberdeen allowed her to be as hands-on as possible with the care of her daughter and that she cannot fault the care that the unit provided.</p><p>One of the more harrowing cases that I have come across is that of my constituent Dani Rose Mackay, who was pregnant with twins and was taken in at 21 weeks with pre-term premature rupture of membranes, or PPROM. One of her twins had no water, but one did. A week later, the other twin had no water either. Both babies had heartbeats right up to labour at 25 weeks, but one of them, Lucy, had stopped growing. Her cord flow was bad and she did not cope with the labour, and her heartbeat stopped during it.</p><p>Dani had been moved to Dundee at 24 weeks because Aberdeen had no room&#8212;a point that I raised earlier&#8212;but labour was stalled with steroids, magnesium and a contraction-stopping drug. At 25 weeks, she was found to be fully dilated, with her daughter Amie&#8217;s foot visible, and was induced. That failed, and 17 hours later Amie was born after surgery, although not a section. However, Dani&#8217;s cervix closed, so Lucy was induced and was stillborn, with waters intact, another seven hours later. Her waters had not ruptured, but had diminished due to placental issues.</p><p>Dani felt that there was a disparity between the service that she was offered in Aberdeen and that in Dundee. Obviously, that predates the guidance that has been implemented, so I hope that it will perhaps change some of that. She said that she would love to see discharge packs being given to mothers when they leave the neonatal unit and more appointments being offered, which would enable mothers to chart the progress of their children. Perhaps having a dedicated outpatient department as the first port of call for mothers who have spent time in the neonatal unit could be looked at.</p><p>I hope that I have been able to put some thoughts in the minister&#8217;s head.

Like Willie Rennie, I have noted the change of tone since last year&#8217;s debate. It is a welcome change. It is always better when we work consensually on sensitive issues such as this one, rather than seeing individuals or parties making a cheap bid for headlines, which can often derail progress that is being made. It is welcome that that has not been prevalent today.</p><p>I take on board the points that have been made about the fact that those who are at the sharp end of poverty and disadvantage often find themselves at the sharp end of drug misuse&#8212;that is absolutely correlated by figures&#8212;but, as Dennis Robertson said, the north-east has a particular problem around affluent drug use. Those people would not classify themselves as problem drug users but would probably consider themselves to be recreational drug users.</p><p>We must also remember that there are circumstances that affect an individual beyond their income, such as abuse of a sexual or domestic nature, which does not confine itself to those in the lowest income brackets. We should not define how drug misuse can affect an individual solely by their income. Christian Allard gave an extremely powerful personal testimony and, in last year&#8217;s debate, I made the point that I could point to individuals in my school yearbook who had fallen into addiction&#8212;individuals who, to all intents and purposes, could be said to have had the same life chances that I had. We do not know what may have gone on in their private lives to affect the trajectory that their lives took.</p><p>There is much to be welcomed. Other members have commented on the treatment statistics. In Aberdeen city, 99.5 per cent of people with drug and alcohol problems are being treated within three weeks, and nobody in Aberdeen is waiting more than six weeks for treatment. Those are extremely welcome statistics. Obviously, we want 100 per cent of those people to be treated within three weeks; nonetheless, having 100 per cent treated within six weeks is extremely positive.</p><p>Although the number of drug deaths is a lot higher than we would want it to be, the number of drug deaths in the under-25 bracket is at its lowest level since records began. In Aberdeen, the number of drug deaths has reduced from 31 in 2010 to 16 in 2012, which is welcome progress.</p><p>In addition, drug taking in the general population has fallen from 12.9 per cent in 2008 to 9.1 per cent in 2011 among 16 to 59-year-olds who self-report their drug use. Among young people, drug taking is at its lowest level in a decade, down from 23 per cent in 2002 to 11 per cent in 2010 according to the statistics that were published by ISD Scotland in December 2011.</p><p>There are around 3,200 drug users in Aberdeen, and Drugs Action tells me that around 2,000 of them are currently accessing drug treatment. That means, however, that there are 1,200 drug users out there whom we need to reach and encourage to seek treatment. I imagine that some of them will fall into the category that I mentioned earlier. Drugs Action offers a range of services across the city, including a counselling service that is available to drug users, ex-users and family members. The point has been made that involving the family in an individual&#8217;s treatment is vital because they have a role to play in assisting that individual&#8217;s recovery. Specialist counselling is also available for people who are affected by HIV, people who have hepatitis B or C, female drug users, young people, the parents or other relatives of drug users and people who are drug free but who are affected by drug misuse through their extended family or friends.</p><p>Drugs Action also offers city outreach services, with weekly drop-in advice, information and needle exchange sessions in my constituency at Mastrick, Northfield, Woodside and Middlefield. The Woodside outreach service has a dedicated worker for the Woodside area who operates two days a week at the Printfield Community Project and the Woodside Fountain centre. The outreach drugs worker offers individual counselling, support, advice and training to drug users, families, community groups and professionals in the Woodside area. There is a whole-community approach to recovery, which is important.</p><p>There is also the Aberdeen recovery community, which is a partnership between Drugs Action and Aberdeen Foyer. It not only seeks to ensure that individuals recover but identifies skills and interests and tries to ensure that, when the individual has been treated, they have the opportunity to reintegrate into society through employment and the opportunities that arise from that.</p><p>If the system receives an individual on the basis of their drug use but does not deal with the other factors affecting that individual, it can be said that the addiction has been treated but the person has not. We need to get to the stage at which the person is treated along with the factors that affect them. That is the concept of wraparound treatment that the Government is emphasising.</p><p>I welcome the report and the progress that is being made. I also very much welcome the consensus that has arisen during the debate. If that consensus holds, we can continue to make extremely positive progress in the area.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22768223", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independent Expert Review of Opioid Replacement Therapies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is an important debate.

My reasoning has evolved as I have grown older, and now that I am the parent of a disabled child I see the world through different eyes. I look to the two futures that are available to my son and to others like him. In the future that the union offers, he is regarded as a burden on the taxpayer and parties compete about who can subject vulnerable people to the harshest welfare regime. Indeed, only recently there was a headline in The Observer, which quoted Rachel Reeves, the Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson for the Labour Party, promising a welfare system that would be tougher than the one that the Tories are currently administering. I do not want a tough welfare system; I want a fair welfare system for the people of Scotland. The future that is on offer in the union is not the one that I want for my son or for any vulnerable citizen in Scotland.</p><p>When I heard Johann Lamont speak on Radio 4&#8217;s &#8220;Any Questions?&#8221;, which was broadcast from Bearsden, something that she said struck a chord with me. She said that it was great that the Scottish Parliament had been delivered and was able to protect the national health service in Scotland from the reforms that are taking place south of the border. Was it not great, she said, that the NHS in Scotland was controlled in Scotland? However, when vulnerable people leave our hospitals and general practitioners&#8217; surgeries and enter the clutches of Westminster welfare reform, Johann Lamont thinks that that is all right. She cannot make the logical step from having this Parliament protect health to having it control other forms of social protection.</p><p>We can do better by our vulnerable citizens. The white paper says:</p><p>&#8220;welfare is a &#8216;social investment&#8217; ... designed ... to promote equality, fairness and social cohesion.&#8221;</p><p>It goes on to say that welfare should be seen not just as a safety net but as</p><p>&#8220;an opportunity for positive investment in people&#8221;,</p><p>and sets out clear policy goals that the Government would pursue were the SNP to be elected, such as the abolition of the bedroom tax and the cancellation of universal credit and personal independence payments.</p><p>Those are real choices that we can make if we have the powers that independence will afford us, to ensure that the same protection that is afforded to our vulnerable citizens through our Scotland-controlled health service is afforded to them through a Scotland-controlled welfare system. We will have an opportunity to recognise the value of all our people, through a system that values all our people and which truly delivers, from cradle to grave.</p><p>The same can be said for our childcare policy. A point with which other parties seem to be having difficulty is that if we are to invest the sums that will be required to deliver transformational change, we need control of Scotland&#8217;s revenues. We do not require the system that Westminster currently operates, whereby we have an ever-diminishing block grant, which is subject to the whims of austerity-mad politicians at Westminster; we need the full power of Scotland&#8217;s resources if we are to deliver on a full range of powers for the people of Scotland.</p><p>That is the essence of independence. It is about Scotland&#8217;s people controlling Scotland&#8217;s future, and Scotland&#8217;s Government delivering for Scotland&#8217;s people. It is about investment in bairns, not bombs. It is about attracting talented people to Scotland, not booting them out of Scotland. It is about protecting the vulnerable, not humiliating and degrading them. That is what independence is about. It is the step that we take as we say to the Scottish people, &#8220;We trust you&#8221;, and they in turn trust the people whom they elect to govern to take decisions for them. It is not a system in which decisions are taken on Scotland&#8217;s behalf by people who did not ask what Scotland wanted them to do.</p><p>We need only look at the common agricultural policy decision to see in operation a system in which Government ministers and officials at Westminster take decisions on behalf of Scotland with nary a care for the impact on Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22765431", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independence White Paper"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will learn from my mistake and not give way again to the Labour leader when I am trying to make a serious point about the hard work of many people that has led us to this point.

In doing a bit of googling ahead of the debate, I ended up on the Daily Mail website, looking at an article that was trying to make out that size 16 models are not different from the norm. Unfortunately, the sidebar contained links to other articles saying things such as, &#8220;Wow! Look at Helena Christensen&#8217;s fantastic bikini body,&#8221; or, &#8220;Look at the weight that Kim Kardashian has lost since she had her baby.&#8221; In essence, that completely and utterly nullified the message of the article. We should bear it in mind that the media has an important role in relation to its enforcement of body stereotypes.</p><p>I want to talk about the way in which mannequins, body size and body perception issues affect men. The charity Beat has argued that male eating disorders in the fashion industry are increasing because of a shift in emphasis from muscular men to slender and skinny men. Beat says that it has seen a rise in the number of men with eating disorders and it is trying to draw attention to that.</p><p>I was interested in Jackie Baillie&#8217;s remarks on the evolution of the mannequin. The company Rootstein has attracted controversy lately with its new mannequin, homme nouveau, which sports a 35-inch chest and a 27-inch waist. In 1967, the Rootstein classic mannequin had a 42-inch chest and 33-inch waist; in 1983, the mannequin that was referred to as the muscleman had a 41-inch chest and a 31-inch waist; and, in 1994, the mannequin that was known as the swimmer had a 38-inch chest and a 28-inch waist. Now, the company has gone to a 35-inch chest and a 27-inch waist.</p><p>It is depressing that such companies do not see the impact that those changes have on society. From my perspective, when I started to put on weight towards the end of my teens, I stopped wearing jeans because I had the perception that jeans were what skinny people wore and that they would not suit somebody who had put on a lot of weight. There is that perception out there.</p><p>Jackie Baillie also made an interesting point about Barbie. Likewise, a body perception is passed across through the dimensions of male action figures. &#8220;Evolving Ideals of Male Body Image as Seen through Action Toys&#8221;, an article by professors at Harvard University medical school, McLean Hospital and the University of Massachusetts Boston, reviewed physiques of male action toys such as GI Joe, or Han Solo and Luke Skywalker from &#8220;Star Wars&#8221;. The review found that the figures have become more muscular over time, with many contemporary figures far exceeding the muscularity of even the largest human bodybuilders. Those toys can lead to perceptions.</p><p>Beat makes the point that, although images and mannequins alone do not cause eating disorders, they reinforce perceptions and stereotypes. An individual&#8217;s negative perception is reinforced if their body image is not reflected in the mainstream media or in the supermarkets that they shop in. In tackling the issue, it is important that we do not say that by having size 16 mannequins we will prevent people from developing eating disorders&#8212;the logic is not as simple as that. However, if we move to a situation in which people see their size represented in the media and on the high street, that will remove some of the negative perception and the isolation that those who have an eating disorder can feel.</p><p>I will finish with a quotation from one of the case studies on the Beat website. One person says:</p><p>&#8220;I just wish that being a size 14 was considered as beautiful as a size 8.&#8221;</p><p>The message that we should send out is that, regardless of your size, you are beautiful.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22740400", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Size 10 Models and Mannequins"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my friend and colleague Dennis Robertson on securing the debate and on bringing this important issue to the chamber.

Recently, it held a seminar that was entitled, &#8220;Thinking ahead: preparing for winter&#8221;, for which it brought in elderly members of the community and talked to them about how they could make appropriate preparations, for example by reducing the risk of slips or falls on their paths. The local police and doctors from the practice were also brought in to participate in the discussion.</p><p>The approach that is being taken in Danestone is interesting, and I am aware that it is being taken by other GP practices across Scotland. The cabinet secretary might want to consider applying the approach more widely and introducing such groups in other areas to ensure that the GP practice is not just the place where people turn up when they are sick, but a place where people feel that they have an involvement in developments and in helping the practice to improve in a way that patients would want to see. I leave that on the table for the cabinet secretary to consider. I would be happy to discuss it with him and the minister after the debate if they would like to find out more.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22724788", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Person-centred Healthcare"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Dr Simpson makes an interesting point that I am sure the cabinet secretary and the minister will take on board.

It was organised by the Aberdeen play forum, whose role is to increase play opportunities in Aberdeen, working with public and private organisations in the city and with charities and voluntary and community organisations to raise awareness of the importance of play. That kind of approach ties in neatly with the strategy that the minister has launched, which I welcome greatly.</p><p>I think back to my time as a councillor when work was undertaken in my ward to reinvigorate some of the play areas in the community&#8212;one at Sluie park in Dyce and two in the Princess Drive area of Dyce&#8212;which had fallen into disrepair and were not well used. In one case it was about bringing partners and funding together to put new equipment in place and to change the layout of the park and make it much more vibrant and well used. In the other case, it was about bringing in some street art on the ground, which reinvigorated the area and has made it very well used by the young children round about.</p><p>There are other areas in my constituency where there is a lack of modern play facilities. In some cases, such as in Forrit Brae and Bucksburn, play facilities have been removed with no prospect of them being replaced.</p><p>I take on board the point that members have made about the funding issues, which I recognise, because I encountered them when I was working as a councillor to reinvigorate some of the play areas. We need to think outside the box, if you will, about how we approach this. We cannot simply say, &#8220;There&#8217;s not enough funding in local authority budgets, so we can&#8217;t make progress.&#8221; We need to find creative ways to encourage new play facilities and play areas to be developed. One of those might be to look to the private sector and to consider whether, in the same way that some local authorities have sponsorship of roundabouts, sponsorship of play parks could fund play facilities.</p><p>We also need to consider the prohibitive cost of play equipment. We need to look at whether the companies that are supplying play equipment are offering true value for money and whether they are asking the price that ought to be paid for such equipment.</p><p>Ken Macintosh&#8217;s anecdote about the Wendy house reminded me that children sometimes do not need expensive play equipment&#8212;imagination is all that is required. In my intervention on &#8220;No ball games&#8221; signs, I was trying to make the point that we sometimes do our level best to prevent play from happening in certain areas. However, when I was growing up &#8220;No ball games&#8221; signs were very good for goalposts. We need to think about how we are encouraging children to use open spaces.</p><p>I will focus the remainder of my speech on the issue of children with disabilities and additional support needs. The Conservative amendment is a welcome addition that enhances and strengthens the motion.</p><p>Here are some testimonials from families who have difficulty in accessing leisure and play facilities:</p><p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything suitable for our young daughter with autism&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;No afterschool clubs or groups to cater for his needs&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;There is nowhere for him due to age and height restrictions&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;Physical access. 1:1 support needed&#8212;can&#8217;t do that with another child to support, physically too difficult&#8221;;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;It is very stressful for our son and us as he doesn&#8217;t do well in crowded places&#8221;.</p><p>I recognise those as issues that I have encountered when looking at the play opportunities for my own son.</p><p>The facilities that people would like to see are:</p><p>&#8220;Sensory rooms and more soft play for ASN&#8221;;</p><p>&#8220;Relaxation, play and learn, movement, ball, storytelling&#8221;;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;To have somewhere to access as a family or with your child with ASN; to have somewhere we could go as a family&#8221;.</p><p>In the north-east&#8212;not necessarily in my constituency&#8212;there are opportunities for families with additional support needs. Kool Kidz, in Insch, is a soft play centre that tries to hold special requirement sessions on a monthly basis&#8212;the next one is on 20 November. I have been to one of those sessions and they are extremely welcome. Hoodles, in Oldmeldrum, is one of the top soft play areas according to a Netmums survey. It holds a special requirement session on the last Thursday of every month, which runs from 5.30 to 8 pm. Today, for Hallowe&#8217;en, there are prizes for the best boy and girl in fancy dress.</p><p>There are good examples of organisations and private enterprises that are reaching out to make their areas more accessible to children with additional support needs. It can be difficult for families with children with additional support needs to access such facilities when they are open to the main stream, as they can be very busy and crowded. If a child has particular sensory issues or a lack of ability to understand the concept of waiting and taking turns, or if a child wants to use only the middle one of three slides, it can be difficult to explain that to other children and parents.</p><p>There is a facility in the north-east&#8212;in Westhill, in Dennis Robertson&#8217;s constituency&#8212;called SensationALL, which is designed specifically to cater for children with additional support needs. It has sensory provision, toys and other opportunities for sensory play, and at present it is fundraising to increase the availability of its play facilities.</p><p>I will end by quoting Dr Seuss because, frankly, any opportunity to do so should be taken:</p><p>Oh, the places you&#8217;ll go! There is fun to be done!</p><p>There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.</p><p>And the magical things you can do with that ball</p><p>will make you the winning-est winner of all.</p><p>By having a national play strategy, we can make Scotland&#8217;s children the winning-est winners of all.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-31", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22716858", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Play Strategy Action Plan"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On 7 August, part of the city centre of Aberdeen was essentially turned into a playground, with 250 to 300 children participating in the Aberdeen national play day, which included face painting, an obstacle course and a bouncy castle.

As I was not party to the committee evidence sessions, I have listened closely to what has been said in the debate about the notion that the block grant adjustment would be based on OBR projections, and I have some concerns because the OBR projections and forecasts on things like economic growth and oil revenues generally tend not to be recognised as being realistic.</p><p>In March 2012, the OBR estimated that in 2014-15, landfill tax income would be &#163;145&#160;million, in 2015-16 it would be &#163;151&#160;million, and in 2016-17 it would be &#163;157&#160;million. By December of the same year, the OBR had reduced the figures to &#163;105&#160;million, &#163;107&#160;million and &#163;107&#160;million respectively. By March 2013, just 12 months after the first figures were published, the OBR reduced them again to &#163;104&#160;million, &#163;105&#160;million and &#163;105&#160;million. Those are quite significant adjustments to be made in 12 months. If it turned out that the projections did not match up to reality and it transpired that the OBR had underestimated or overestimated the figures at any stage, that would have implications for the block grant adjustment and potential future clawback. It is therefore important to ensure that the sums add up, so I would welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s views on how he sees the role of the OBR projections and whether there is a better way of looking at those in future years.</p><p>The bill is important not just because of its revenue implications but because it is a tax that is clearly linked to environmental sustainability. It is, essentially, designed as a deterrent to landfill and an encouragement to consider alternative means of waste disposal that will reduce the landfill tax burden on public bodies and organisations. We should not be afraid to administer the landfill tax in that way, which is why I was interested in Gavin Brown&#8217;s point about the rate at which the tax is to be levied. I caution against entering into any kind of taxation competition over the rate at which landfill tax is levied.</p><p>I also do not buy the argument about waste tourism. Rob Gibson summed up the point appropriately when he said that, even within Scotland, many authorities have significant distances to travel to dispose of waste to landfill, so the notion that local authorities or organisations will send trucks across the border to dispose of waste to landfill for a marginal saving on the tax, which would soon be gobbled up by the associated transportation costs, does not really bear scrutiny.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22713734", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members have covered how we got to where we are with the landfill tax being devolved to the Scottish Parliament, which emphasises the fact that we in Scotland and in the Scottish Parliament are able to administer taxation and deal with the responsibilities that come with that.

The administering of a landfill communities fund in Scotland gives us the opportunity to address that imbalance.</p><p>It is interesting as well to consider, when we come to the establishment of a landfill communities fund in Scotland, the need to ensure that although it will be done through subordinate legislation, organisations such as Aberdeen Greenspace in my constituency could feed in their thoughts on how the fund might operate and how it might operate differently to the way in which the current UK fund is administered through Entrust. I would welcome an opportunity to have that dialogue outside the debate.</p><p>On the 10-mile radius, I take on board Michael McMahon&#8217;s point. My experience, through working with Aberdeen Greenspace, was slightly different, in that there were often opportunities to expand the work that was being done through the landfill community fund to which the 10-mile radius proved to be a barrier. We have to accept and recognise that environmental sustainability does not always have to be geographically constrained. The broadening out of the ability to use the money for other projects would perhaps have a knock-on effect on landfill and so might indirectly benefit communities that find themselves adjacent to landfill. Some such communities are just on the border of my constituency as well, so I think that the 10-mile radius needs to be examined because there are opportunities that would be restricted if we were to retain it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22713734", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Landfill Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I say to Mr Brown that I do not think that that argument would stand up to scrutiny based on what Mr Gibson has said.

I have played quite a unique role in the process, as I was a member of that committee when the petitions were lodged. I then became a member of the Health and Sport Committee when it was undertaking its inquiry into the issue, so I have been involved from the beginning in the parliamentary process, although I missed the writing of the report due to being engaged in a by-election up in Aberdeen. The point is that the process has demonstrated a concern being brought to Parliament and being given the serious treatment that it requires.</p><p>I want to consider the issues around rare diseases and orphan conditions, following on from Ken Macintosh&#8217;s points. I admit that I was familiar with the issues prior to the petitions being lodged, but I would not previously have professed to know as much as I have since learned about rare diseases and orphan conditions.</p><p>In the Routledge report, the recommendation was made that the SMC</p><p>&#8220;should develop a policy specifically relating to ultra-orphan medicines to guide the process of consideration of all available evidence&#8221;.</p><p>That is one of the difficulties that has been faced in relation to ultra-orphan medicines. The fact is that there is a very small patient cohort not necessarily just in Scotland, or just the United Kingdom, but sometimes pan-Europe; we are talking about a very small number of people. It can therefore be difficult to ensure that there are robust trial data for medicines. Also&#8212;and most crucially, in terms of some of the points that have been raised&#8212;there is an issue around affordability, within QALY, of the medicines that are available for ultra-orphan conditions. That is why I welcome Professor Routledge&#8217;s further recommendation about having a temporary pause in the appraisal process. The Scottish Government has accepted that recommendation and it is one that the Health and Sport Committee welcomed in its report, saying that</p><p>&#8220;such a pause could also create an opportunity for discussion on, for example, whether there was scope to develop a reimbursement rate which could into account various factors such as supplying post licensing data or assessed benefit of medicines post approval.&#8221;</p><p>To me, the moves around the threshold of QALY and around the pause in the process create what could be described as a double-lock opportunity, in that those moves allow for much wider consideration of medicines that previously would simply not have been considered. Also, they allow for further discussion of medicines that are still not captured by that process, in order to allow them to be so captured. That is encouraging.</p><p>I am sure that members will be aware of the AllTrials campaign: it has been running for a significant time and has a number of high-profile supporters. It seeks to ensure that trial data that are made available at the point at which drugs are submitted for approval are as transparent and robust as possible. I believe that, as well as there being role for the SMC, and a role for the decision-making process, there is a role for the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Eric Low, the chief executive of Myeloma UK, has said that he is</p><p>&#8220;very encouraged that the SMC will be given additional resources and a revised remit so that they can further build on and evolve their already excellent appraisal processes.&#8221;</p><p>However, he goes on to say that</p><p>&#8220;it is critically important that while improvements to access to medicines are made we also ensure that we are getting genuine value for money, and that the pharmaceutical industry improves the type and quality of information it provides to get their medicines funded on the NHS. I strongly believe that the SMC are best placed to help make this happen.&#8221;</p><p>There is an issue about pharmaceutical companies fulfilling their role not just on transparency but on affordability, because we cannot escape the fact that we live in a world of finite resource within the health service. It is therefore imperative that the drugs companies show willing to come to the table and negotiate on prices. That point was reflected in a lot of the evidence that the committee received during its deliberations.</p><p>The SMC investment is very welcome. We need to make the SMC process not just more transparent, but more publicly accessible. It is one thing to publish the findings of the SMC, but to the individual on the street&#8212;indeed, even to the MSP&#8212;a lot of decisions are published that are very difficult to translate. Making that information more publicly accessible and explaining it to the public would be helpful. All too often we read stories about drugs that have not been approved, but we do not always see or understand the reasons that lie behind the decisions, so making that information more accessible would be beneficial.</p><p>I am not sure whether the cabinet secretary has been made aware of it, but the MS Society has raised a number of questions. My colleague, George Adam, who has a strong link to the MS Society, asked me to bring them to the debate, to which I agreed. I will forward the briefing to the cabinet secretary so that he can reply more fully. The questions are about the timescale for introducing value-based assessment. The crux of the MS Society&#8217;s concern is the Scottish Government&#8217;s plan to involve stakeholders in developing the reforms. I suspect that the crux of the concerns of many other organisations would be how stakeholder organisations will feed into the reform process and feel fully involved. A point that has been raised repeatedly is that we should, as well as making the process being more transparent and open, ensure that organisations and individuals who have a concern or an interest can feed in their views and have them taken into account. Perhaps the cabinet secretary will take a moment in his closing remarks to reflect on that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698796", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Access to New Medicines"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I pay tribute to the petitioners who came to the Public Petitions Committee to raise their concerns in Parliament.

The council tax freeze prevents people who are at the lower end from facing a greater burden as a result of rising council taxes, which benefits them.</p><p>I was interested in Ken Macintosh&#8217;s point about community ownership of renewables, on which we probably find common cause. When I was a list MSP, I visited the community wind turbine in the parish of Udny, which is just outside Aberdeen. That turbine is being used to generate income for the community, which is being distributed via local groups. Community renewables can also be used in other ways&#8212;for example, to reduce energy costs rather than to generate income. That needs to be looked at. Good work is being done on community renewables, but we might need to look at how to expand that.</p><p>I represent a constituency in a city that is, on the face of it, very wealthy. Aberdeen has a high employment rate, a low unemployment rate and a low long-term unemployment rate. However, that masks some of the poverty in the city. Members who came to campaign in the Donside by-election will be aware of some of the deprived communities in my constituency. Those areas feel the sharp end of some of the cost-of-living issues that we are discussing.</p><p>Good work is done in my constituency by a range of organisations that are dedicating effort to assisting people who are at the sharp end. For example, Woodside learning centre hosts a mini-market that prices goods at an affordable rate for people in the community, who can shop there rather than use the supermarkets, where many goods are priced out of their reach. The Printfield Community Project has a charity shop in which no items are priced and people are asked what they can afford to pay rather than priced out of purchasing items. Such approaches are helping my constituents in difficult times.</p><p>I cannot help but think that we would be better served if we looked carefully at cause and effect. The point was rightly made that&#8212;as Jackie Baillie highlighted in her speech&#8212;the genesis of the problems that have been identified as affecting people in Scotland is in policy decisions that are made south of the border in reserved areas. We can take at face value the points that Labour members make&#8212;I do not doubt for one second that members like Kezia Dugdale are passionate about the issues that they bring to the chamber&#8212;but what gets my goat is the notion that the Labour Party somehow has a monopoly on compassion and that SNP members are a bunch of uncaring, soulless individuals who focus only on the referendum.</p><p>I have made the point several times that I am not in this just to get powers for Scotland and say, &#8220;Job done.&#8221; I am in this to get powers for Scotland and to use them to shape a fairer and more equal society for the people who live here.

It took a great deal of courage for Aileen to relate her personal experiences in Parliament and I thank her very much for doing that.

It cannot have been easy for her to relive the experience and write it out for members of this Parliament to read. I read it and I was struck by its content.</p><p>Although detecting cancer as early as possible is obviously a healthcare issue, I have identified an attitudinal issue in the briefing and in Amy&#8217;s letter. We need to look at how seriously we take young people when they present with health problems and ensure that they are not dismissed as readily as Amy&#8217;s fears about her health were. All too often in society, we do not listen enough to young people when they talk about their problems. We need to do that.</p><p>When it comes to the wider attitudinal agenda, I absolutely agree that we need to raise awareness of the issue. I note from the briefing that</p><p>&#8220;Cancer is the most common cause of non-accidental death in young people, and five-year survival rates remain lower in teenagers than in children. While cancer in this age group is rare, it&#8217;s vital for young people to know the common signs so they can seek medical advice if they are worried.&#8221;</p><p>It is not just a case of educating young people by talking to them; it is also about getting young people to be more open to talking about the issue among themselves. It strikes me that there is a parallel with the conversations that we have had about mental health, in that it is not a comfortable subject for people to talk about; it is not the sort of thing that they talk about at the dinner table or among their peers and friends. If we make people comfortable enough to open up about it, to discuss it and to help one another through difficulties by spotting the signs, we can save lives.</p><p>The work that the trust is doing, which I read about in its briefing, is fantastic. We should look at how we can replicate that work across Scotland. I am aware from conversations that my office had with the trust that it has not yet expanded its services into the Aberdeen area. I look forward to having a discussion with the trust about whether it has plans to do so in future, and about what MSPs who represent communities where it does not yet have a reach can do to take its message to health boards and health professionals. I would be happy to have such a discussion, perhaps at the reception, if I am able to attend it.</p><p>I commend Aileen McLeod for bringing the issue to the chamber.

Having grown up in Dyce, I am very familiar with the movements of helicopters and helicopter noise. Indeed, I have developed something of an immunity to the noise that helicopters make. However, it was interesting to hear the stark silence that pervaded the area when the helicopter flights were grounded, and the lack of helicopter movements around the community was noticeable.</p><p>Many of my constituents, family and friends are directly or indirectly involved in the offshore industry and the flights. I have heard many tales of family members such as partners and children being deeply concerned for the safety of those whom they love having to be transported by helicopter to the rigs. I have spoken to a number of individuals who have said that, although we obviously have to look at the overall safety record of the helicopters, they are concerned about the number of incidents that have taken place during a fairly short period of time.</p><p>In my question to the cabinet secretary following his statement, I mentioned that I had attended school with one of the victims of the 2009 fatal accident. Stuart Wood was in the year below me at Dyce academy, and I notice that his mother has recently commented in the press about the delays to the fatal accident inquiry. We all wish to place on the record our desire to see that fatal accident inquiry take place as soon as possible to ensure that some of the questions that the victims&#8217; families have can be addressed.</p><p>We need to look at the context of what is happening with helicopter safety. I am sure that this week&#8217;s announcements were not prompted by Richard Baker&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate today, but they have taken precedence during the past few days. Announcements have been made about the CAA review, and I welcome the fact that the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority will be involved in that review because, as we understand it, the Norwegian safety record is somewhat better than that of the UK. It is very welcome that the Norwegian CAA&#8217;s head of helicopter safety will be working very closely with us on that review.</p><p>There have been recent reports that the seating configuration on Super Puma helicopters will be looked at. That issue was raised during meetings that I and other MSPs had with Eurocopter and it, too, needs to be factored into the review. Yesterday&#8217;s announcement from three other operators that they are to launch their own reviews and are calling for other helicopter operators to become involved in that review bears witness to the fact that a lot of work is being done at the moment.</p><p>I am not necessarily 100 per cent in agreement with Richard Baker, because the landscape of review and inquiry could become cluttered. There is a point at which we must ask where we step back and allow some of the work that is being done to take place so that the lessons from that work can be applied to any future inquiry or review, rather than running parallel inquiries and running the risk of missing some of those lessons.

What was particularly sweet was that the victory was secured by one of Europe&#8217;s more out-of-form players, Martin Kaymer; indeed, one of the beauties of the Ryder cup is that it often makes heroes out of players whose form up to that point might well have been patchy and who might not have been performing well in regular tournament play.</p><p>The Ryder cup is going to bring a lot of golf fans to Scotland in 2014.

In that respect, there are obvious links not just to the wider tourism agenda that members have referred to but to the golf tourism agenda in particular; after all, many of these people will be keen golfers as well as golf fans and will be visiting not just for the duration of the Ryder cup but for one, two or even three weeks, depending on their schedules. As a result, we must promote the very best golf courses that are available. I appreciate that some might not want to play just the elite courses and, indeed, the elite courses are not always the best ones to play on. There are also very good municipal courses that are worth highlighting.</p><p>I want to focus on one course in particular&#8212;and I am sure that it will surprise members no end to hear that I am going to talk about Royal Aberdeen golf club, which is in my constituency. Between July 10 and 13 next year, Royal Aberdeen is going to host the 2014 Scottish open. In order to link this to the Ryder cup, I note that the course is also the one where, in 2005, the British senior open was held. That was won by the current US Ryder cup captain, Tom Watson, in a sudden-death playoff against Des Smyth, himself a previous European Ryder cup vice-captain. The course, due to its hosting of the Scottish open in the year of the Ryder cup and the fact that it has a link&#8212;albeit tenuous&#8212;to the current Ryder cup line-up, sees itself as being in a position to capitalise on the presence of the Ryder cup in Scotland and the ensuing golf tourism. Having spoken to Ronnie MacAskill, the director of golf at Royal Aberdeen golf club, I know that he is keen to see the club benefit in that way. In 2005, some 23,349 people came to Royal Aberdeen for the senior open. The club hopes that more than that will come in 2014 for the Scottish open, which is estimated to generate somewhere in the region of &#163;10 million for the local economy.</p><p>I have mentioned previously the controversy that existed around the hosting of the event by Royal Aberdeen. That controversy arose not through anything that the Scottish Government said, but through the actions of some local councillors in Aberdeen, who have taken the opportunity to play politics with the event. I would hope that the issue will finally be dropped and that we can get on with looking forward to what will be a fantastic event for the city of Aberdeen, rather than seeing some people seeking to undermine the event for narrow political agendas.</p><p>I was interested in the mentions of the clubgolf programme and undertook to look up the statistics for Aberdeen&#8212;I was unable to get statistics right down to constituency level, but I got hold of the participation rates for Aberdeen. I hear what Patricia Ferguson was saying about wanting to encourage greater participation, and I absolutely concur with her words. However it is interesting to note that the Aberdeen figures show that the level of participation for girls is virtually the same as it is for boys&#8212;the last figures that were made available showed 650 girls participating and 662 boys participating.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the female game is on the rise in terms of skill levels&#8212;we see female golfers occasionally joining male tournaments in the United States, and I think that we will start to see more of that as the elite female golfers become ever closer to the elite male golfers in terms of ability. I am not saying that they are not capable golfers but, obviously, the physiology often leads to them not being able to drive the same distances, although that is becoming less and less of an issue. I hear Mr Findlay sighing, but I recently watched the Solheim cup on Sky television, and I have to say that I found it to be almost as exciting as any Ryder cup match that I have ever watched, or any other tournament. I think that the Solheim cup is very much on the rise as well, and perhaps Scotland should bid to hold it at some stage in the future.</p><p>Aberdeen has its own link to the Ryder cup through Paul Lawrie, who played in 1999 and was joint top point scorer and then played in 2012. It was something of a rich moment for Paul Lawrie&#8212;who was, obviously, on the receiving end of the Brookline result&#8212;to be able to be involved in the Medinah result; indeed, he played a key role in it, through his defeat of Brandt Snedeker in the singles play on the final day. Paul Lawrie has launched the Paul Lawrie Foundation, which encourages young people to get involved in the game and seeks to develop their enthusiasm for the sport. It and the Scottish Government&#8217;s clubgolf initiative are the kind of things that we should be seeking to advance and to support where possible.</p><p>I note Mr Findlay&#8217;s comments about the future of many golf clubs hanging in the balance, with depressed incomes leading to people taking themselves off waiting lists. I think that the Ryder cup might have the opposite effect, in that through the increased interest in golf that it could generate, more people might seek to take up the sport, in the same way as people often seek to take up tennis in the immediate aftermath of Wimbledon. Often, the ripple is very shallow, but we might see more people becoming interested in getting involved in local golf.</p><p>I wonder whether something could be done to support some of those municipal clubs that might see an upsurge in applications for membership with which they might find that they are unable to cope in the initial stages. Perhaps something could be done through the Scottish Government&#8217;s legacy work to help to support the clubs and enable them to take on more members, because we want to ensure that people who find themselves enthused and inspired to get involved in golf&#8212;or perhaps to get back into golf&#8212;do not find that they are unable to do so, because we want to encourage more people to take up the sport as a result of the Ryder cup.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the minister&#8217;s remarks in her closing speech.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697799", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Ryder Cup 2014"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In line with most of this afternoon&#8217;s speeches, mine will begin with my declaring an interest in that I have played golf&#8212;and I will probably leave it at that.

I notified you in advance to that effect.</p><p>I was interested to read the report by the Equal Opportunities Committee. I note that it took evidence at the Clinterty site, which is located in my constituency. It has 17 permanent plots and four short-term plots. One of the difficulties that the council has always faced is that those plots are invariably always being let at the time when encampments arrive in Aberdeen, so there is no suitable alternative site to which the council can direct the Travelling community.</p><p>I am more than familiar with the issue now, as an MSP, but I was also familiar with it in my time as a local councillor for Dyce, Bucksburn and Danestone. Over the summer of 2007, just after I was elected, there were a number of encampments in my council ward, which led to the heightened tensions that members have identified. As part of the coalition administration in Aberdeen, I did what I could to try to get the issue addressed. Indeed, rather than it being the convener of the north area committee who moved recommendations on establishing halting sites, I had to do it as a member of the committee because the convener was unwilling to put his head above the parapet and take those tough decisions.</p><p>During our time in that administration, we found that the lack of leadership pervaded the council, both in terms of our coalition colleagues, who were unwilling to take a stance in favour of halting sites and to pursue them, and in the often reprehensible rhetoric, which I will return to, of opposition councillors, who sought to make political capital from the issue and to put us in a difficult position.</p><p>We therefore took the view that one of the difficulties that we faced as a council was that clashes were inevitable between the need to establish a halting site and the kickback that we would get from a settled community if we attempted to establish a site next to it. We agreed that one way in which to deal with that would be to put into the council&#8217;s local development plan a requirement to establish a halting site in certain sizes of new development. Again, we found ourselves being attacked on that by political opportunists, but we pressed ahead with it nonetheless.</p><p>Let us fast-forward to 2013. At the beginning of the year, the council administration announced plans to develop halting sites. However, the way in which the plans were unveiled and the complete failure to consult on the sites have further badly damaged community relations in Aberdeen.</p><p>If a council is going to establish halting sites, it must engage with the settled community. We understand that that is a difficult sell for politicians, but it is not good enough to do nothing to consult communities and bring them along with the plans.</p><p>In Aberdeen, the council is attempting to pass the buck on the issue. Although the establishment of halting sites is the council&#8217;s responsibility, at the full council meeting in August the council moved that it will not progress a halting site until the Scottish Government grants a byelaw to the city that, as Councillor Willie Young said, would</p><p>&#8220;make illegal camping a criminal and not just a civil offence.&#8221;</p><p>That does not help to move the issue forward in the way that the Equal Opportunities Committee wants it to move forward. Indeed, in letters to me, the Solicitor General for Scotland and Police Scotland suggested that a byelaw is entirely unnecessary, because the existence of halting sites will mean that a council is free to take appropriate steps if an unauthorised encampment exists in its area and people are reluctant to move to the halting sites that have been created.</p><p>I want to get back to talking about the rhetoric. I understand that emotions often run high on the matter. We need only look at the reporting and letters pages in the papers and at the letters that all elected members who have encampments in their constituencies or council wards receive from the settled community to see that. That is why it is vital that politicians, whether at national or local level, are careful in the language that we use when we deal with the issue. We have a responsibility not to heighten tensions or inflame opinion.</p><p>The current housing convener in Aberdeen City Council, Neil Cooney, said recently:</p><p>&#8220;Aberdeen City Council recognises Gypsy/Travellers as a marginalised, vulnerable group who historically have experienced discrimination and disadvantage&#8221;.</p><p>I think that we all agree with that statement, but the difficulty that I have is that that is the same Neil Cooney who, when he was in opposition in the council in 2007, hit the headlines when he accused Gypsy Travellers of &#8220;environmental terrorism&#8221;. Such rhetoric has no place in the debate. Indeed, at the time, Alfie Kefford, the chairman of the Gypsy Council, said that Councillor Cooney&#8217;s remarks were &#8220;highly offensive&#8221; and</p><p>&#8220;We are extremely angry at what this man has said and want him sacked.&#8221;</p><p>Instead of being sacked, Councillor Cooney has now been appointed as convener of housing and environment and is responsible for Aberdeen City Council&#8217;s leadership on the Gypsy Traveller situation.</p><p>If the local approach is to put individuals who use such rhetoric in positions of leadership on the issue, it is little wonder that there has been little movement. I very much hope that all members will use their influence on councillors and local politicians to ensure that the discussions and debates that need to happen do so in a respectful manner, without the kind of rhetoric that I described.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Where Gypsy Travellers Live"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Presiding Officer, I begin by apologising that I will have to leave at the conclusion of my speech to get to a public meeting in my constituency this evening.

[Applause.] It is important that I begin by paying tribute to my predecessor, Brian Adam, who, as we all know, had tributes paid to him in the Parliament at the time of his passing. Brian was a great source of encouragement and inspiration for me during my time as an activist and then as a city councillor, when I worked closely with him. He was a man who always put the communities of his constituency at the forefront, and that is something that I aim to do in following in his footsteps.</p><p>The Aberdeen Donside constituency is something of a microcosm for many of the issues that affect the wider Scotland. Its social dynamics, which members will have seen as they came to campaign, range from the affluent to the areas of poverty that still exist within what is regarded outside Aberdeen as a rich city. We still have what my colleague Kevin Stewart has oft described as poverty amidst plenty within the city of Aberdeen.</p><p>I spent the summer going round my constituency and talking to various groups in the community about issues that affect them and, turning to the legislative programme that lies before us, I note that much in it will be of interest and benefit to the communities that I represent. It was interesting to note Johann Lamont claiming that Scotland is now on pause. I think that it is worth noting that Ms Lamont seemed to spend the entire summer on mute. The community empowerment and renewal bill will offer significant opportunities for community groups and organisations across Scotland. I echo some of what Alison Johnstone said about that. I hope that it will allow, for example, the development of community gardens and play facilities, and allow sports clubs to come together to develop facilities on land that is currently unused.</p><p>Those are the kind of opportunities that we want to see being unlocked, because there often seems to be far too much bureaucratic process lying in the way of that happening. I hope that legislation can be introduced that will allow such groups to take control of resources within their communities and operate them for the benefit of people in their communities.</p><p>One of the other interesting and very welcome elements of the legislative programme is the airgun licensing. I encountered that issue during my time in Aberdeen as a parliamentary researcher and latterly as a councillor. It was being pushed very hard by Norman Collie, a Labour councillor at that time, in relation to a potential City of Aberdeen byelaw to deal with the issue.</p><p>I was delighted to receive Norman Collie&#8217;s backing and endorsement during the course of the Donside by-election campaign and I am sure that he would be equally delighted to learn of the progress that is being made on airgun licensing in this Parliament. It is a demonstration of this Parliament taking action in Scotland to deal with priorities that have been identified within Scotland.</p><p>I noticed George Osborne&#8217;s visit to my constituency today. He trotted out the claim that we do not need to look at taking control of oil in Scotland because it is already benefiting Scotland, apparently. If he took the time while visiting my constituency to go and knock the doors in areas such as Middlefield and Cummings Park, he would encounter many individuals who are feeling the sharp end of his welfare reform and austerity agenda.</p><p>What we need to do is less of the taking away of the benefits from people and more to ensure that those who are in work&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is my first speech in the Parliament since the Donside by-election.

I recently visited Danestone primary school in Aberdeen, which is in my former council ward, and I learned about the positive work that is being done there around the teaching of Mandarin Chinese to primary school pupils. Visa restrictions are a difficulty for the scheme to introduce Mandarin, as the system does not allow Chinese teachers to come and teach in Scotland on two to three-year secondments. They are only being awarded 12-month visas, with the potential&#8212;but no guarantee&#8212;of a 12-month extension. I hope that the work that I know the Scottish Government is doing will help to persuade the UK Government to consider that scheme sympathetically for a possible relaxation of the visa restrictions. I hope that we can count on Liz Smith&#8217;s support&#8212;perhaps she can use her influence over the UK Government.</p><p>It was my great privilege to be invited to speak at the launch of the Prince&#8217;s Trust get into energy event at the Marcliffe Hotel in Aberdeen on 22 April. At the event, we heard moving testimony from a Prince&#8217;s Trust ambassador, Marie Cope, a young Aberdeen mum whose life turned around through work with the Prince&#8217;s Trust programme.</p><p>Marie began skipping school at a very young age, and quickly fell into bad company, finding herself involved in abusive relationships and substance misuse. She became a single mother saddled with significant financial debts and in constant fear of visits to her home from debt collectors, which led to her developing a severe fear of opening the door when someone knocked at it. Thanks to the Prince&#8217;s Trust&#8217;s get into retail programme, Marie was able to remove herself from some of the negative influences that she was surrounded by. She was able to turn her life around and is now a youth ambassador for the Prince&#8217;s Trust and a strong testimony to the success of the Prince&#8217;s Trust programmes in helping vulnerable young people to turn their lives around and get into work.</p><p>That is what the focus of the get into energy programme was about. The event was held during north-east business week and served as a good example of how large local employers&#8212;particularly in the oil and gas sector, which, as we know, is extremely prominent in the north-east of Scotland&#8212;can use their influence and expertise to make a difference to disadvantaged young people and use their corporate social responsibility budgets and departments to best effect by investing in young people, who may become their staff in the future.</p><p>There is a clear correlation between youth unemployment and mental health issues, and between youth unemployment and growing up in some of the more deprived communities under the Scottish index of multiple deprivation. By investing in schemes such as get into energy and other Prince&#8217;s Trust schemes, companies can make a targeted difference and try to mitigate the effect of austerity&#8212;and we know that austerity hits hardest those who were vulnerable before a recession. Through promoting those programmes and companies&#8217; involvement in them, we can make a targeted difference to those people, who probably most need targeted support and assistance to gain access to the workforce.</p><p>The energy leadership group is currently of particular interest in the north-east. It is a group of energy companies that come together to provide opportunities to disadvantaged young people, mostly from the north-east of Scotland. The scheme works by companies paying money to the Prince&#8217;s Trust and, in return, the young people go on to their training and mentoring programmes and potentially go on to work for them. The companies provide internships and training schemes for young people who are interested in the sector and issue development awards. It is clear that not everybody who goes into the scheme will subsequently find employment in the company with which they are involved, but the fact that they get an opportunity to develop as an individual will stand them in far better stead when they go into the jobs market than perhaps would be the case if the scheme did not exist.</p><p>I want to mention the work of the young Scotland&#8217;s got talent campaign, which is for young people with learning disabilities and young people on the autistic spectrum. The campaign helps them to access the employment support services that they need&#8212;specifically, it is for those who are able to take part in employment and want to do so. It takes the form of a roadshow at various venues across Scotland and is organised jointly by the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability, Enable Scotland and Values Into Action Scotland. It gathers together young people with learning disabilities and young people on the autistic spectrum, their families, professional bodies and public bodies, including colleges and Government agencies, to share ideas, experiences and opportunities for gaining employment and further skills. The fact that it brings together individuals who would benefit from supported employment schemes and organisations that have the capacity to provide them helps to make links and connections for people who can often find it difficult to access the jobs market.</p><p>The next event is to be held in the Grampian region, at the Aberdeen arts centre, on Wednesday, 5 June. I hope that the minister considers this an invitation to go up to Aberdeen, visit the event and see for herself the work that is being done. I know that the Glasgow event in 2010 was attended by 350 young people and that almost 400 more wanted to attend it but were not able to do so because of the size of the venue. That demonstrates the capacity and appetite out there.</p><p>In Aberdeen, my colleague Gordon Townson, who is in the Aberdeen City Council Scottish National Party group, has promoted a youth employment strategy for the council through a notice of motion to the council. Aberdeen&#8217;s youth employment rate is well above the national average, but it is quite clear from the debate and the Government&#8217;s actions that we cannot be complacent.</p><p>The schemes that I have highlighted plus the actions that the Scottish Government and other agencies are taking demonstrate that we are taking the matter very seriously.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690668", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It was interesting that Liz Smith finished on the subject of modern languages.

Nanette Milne and I have both visited the new state-of-the-art emergency care centre in Aberdeen, which is a &#163;110&#160;million project that will improve and enhance the patient experience and will, I hope, lead to a reduction in the length of time that people are required to be in the care of the health service, which will obviously be beneficial.</p><p>In addition, in terms of the gateway services that we rely on, a project to build a new Woodside Fountain health centre serving the communities of Woodside and Tillydrone is being delivered through hub funding of &#163;4&#160;million. There are in that area some deprived communities that the new centre will benefit.

The tool will assist in that.</p><p>Demographic change will not just put pressure on beds in the health service. There will also be a requirement for more people to act as unpaid carers. I have experience of that; my mother cared for her mother, who had dementia. More people will choose that option, rather than rely on social care or health services to take on the caring role. We need to ensure that appropriate support is in place, which is why the carers strategy and the dementia strategy are so important.</p><p>We need to ensure that there is early diagnosis and intervention and that individuals get the most appropriate care and support, in the setting that is most appropriate for them.

Although I was not part of the stage 1 deliberations on the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill, I was part of the committee when evidence was being taken regarding the transfer of powers under the Scotland Bill&#8212;now the Scotland Act 2012. I will touch on that later in my speech.</p><p>There are three key areas that I wish to consider. The first involves the progressive nature of the land and buildings transaction tax as introduced by the Scottish Government. The second is about the administration of taxation in Scotland, specifically in relation to LBTT. Thirdly, there is the principle of greater control.</p><p>I start with the progressive nature of the tax. The idea that the burden of payment should reflect the ability of the payer to bear it is the principle that has guided the bill. We can consider some of the supportive comments that have been made in that regard. Isobel d&#8217;Inverno, convener of the Law Society of Scotland&#8217;s tax law committee said:</p><p>&#8220;We strongly support the replacement of the slab system of stamp duty land tax, which many perceive as unfair due to the steep rise in tax for properties just above the thresholds. This distorts the market by keeping prices artificially low and gives rise to tax avoidance. We are certain that the proposed new progressive structure will be fairer and simpler for those buying a house.&#8221;</p><p>The Edinburgh Solicitors Property Centre was quoted in the Evening Times as saying that the current structure of slab duty</p><p>&#8220;creates inequalities in the level of taxation paid.&#8221;</p><p>I note that, in its submission to the Finance Committee, the Council of Mortgage Lenders Scotland said:</p><p>&#8220;While there would be winners and losers out of any new system we believe a progressive system would be more equitable and overcome some of the inefficiencies created by the slab system.&#8221;</p><p>I think that that will be an important measure. I say that especially as a member who represents North East Scotland, where property prices are high. That means not only that property is expensive and towards the upper end of the scale to which the duty would apply, but that properties that are further down the property ladder also have inflated prices. At the moment, stamp duty is exempted for houses that sell for less than &#163;125,000, but it is difficult to find a decent-sized family property in Aberdeen and other parts of the north-east that would come under that threshold. By raising the threshold under which duty will not apply, the Scottish Government will benefit constituents of mine, many of whom&#8212;either young families or first-time buyers&#8212;are looking to make that step onto the property ladder. I therefore welcome the move and disagree with those who have said that first-time buyers are not necessarily looking to buy those kinds of properties. In some parts of Scotland, those kinds of properties are the only ones that are available. Therefore, the introduction of the new levels as part of LBTT is welcome.</p><p>I welcome the establishment of revenue Scotland. In particular, I welcome the fact that it will be able to deliver greater efficiency in the administration of tax; the administration costs will be around 25 per cent lower than those of HMRC. That will be of benefit not only to the Scottish Government, but to the taxpayer, because it will avoid some of the inefficiencies that might otherwise have existed in the system.</p><p>When the Finance Committee took evidence from HMRC on the introduction of new tax powers, I asked whether, in theory, it could refuse to administer the new taxes on behalf of the Scottish Government, were the Scottish Government to take a radically different approach to that which exists in the rest of the UK. I was told that, in theory, it could. That might have meant that the Scottish Government could have found itself unnecessarily hamstrung had it chosen not to establish revenue Scotland and instead to rely on HMRC, because it might have been unable to create a different kind of system along the lines of LBTT. The establishment of revenue Scotland will allow the Scottish Government that flexibility and the ability to do something different.</p><p>The creation of revenue Scotland also demonstrates that the Government and this Parliament are capable of handling the burden of greater power and responsibility being handed to us.</p><p>That said, we must accept that, even with the new taxes being transferred to Scotland, 85 per cent of the tax that is paid in Scotland will remain reserved and the Scottish Parliament will have control of and responsibility for only 58 per cent of the revenue that is spent in Scotland. The Government and I want that to shift more towards Scotland having greater control of the revenue of Scotland and having all the revenue and taxation powers of Scotland at its disposal.</p><p>If LBTT does nothing else, it serves as a microcosm that shows that this Parliament and this Government can do something radically different from the status quo. We can do something more innovative and progressive on taxation when the powers exist in this Parliament to do so.</p><p>I look forward to the day when LBTT comes into force, but I also look forward to the day when this Parliament takes control of the other taxation and revenue-raising powers that would exist with independence, because I believe that what we are doing today demonstrates that a different approach is not only possible but optimal.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689608", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I rise as a former member of the Finance Committee.

The report was put together by Crisis, Heriot-Watt University and the University of York. It highlights two other changes that are being made in the housing sphere that will impact on homelessness in Scotland beyond the bedroom tax.</p><p>The first change mentioned in the report is the</p><p>&#8220;extension of the &#8216;Shared Accommodation Rate&#8217; of Local Housing Allowance to 25-34 year-olds living in the private rented sector, which will increase pressure on a limited supply of shared accommodation and possibly force vulnerable people into inappropriate shared settings (even with the concession for those who have lived in hostels for at least three months)&#8221;.</p><p>The other change is the</p><p>&#8220;increased conditionality and sanctions associated with the Work Programme, coupled with the transferring of many vulnerable complaints from sickness benefits into Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance, implying the possibility of stringent sanctions applied to vulnerable single homeless people and others with chaotic lifestyles.&#8221;</p><p>Therefore, it would be wrong to say that only the bedroom tax will have an impact on the homelessness agenda.</p><p>An interesting thing about the bedroom tax is that because we have ended priority need in Scotland, 64 per cent of homeless applications come from single people, as opposed to 25 per cent south of the border. However, one-bedroom properties make up 26 per cent of social housing, which means that people who are homeless will be housed in properties in which they will find themselves subjected to the bedroom tax.</p><p>We should not single out the bedroom tax for mitigation, because there are other benefits that people might wish us to mitigate. We therefore must make the case for why we can mitigate one but not another. We can do that for council tax benefit because power has been passed in its entirety to this Parliament&#8217;s control. However, the bedroom tax remains a reserved imposition on Scotland, rather than something that has been transferred to our control.</p><p>Drew Smith was correct when he said to Willie Rennie that if the policy is about saving money it can work only if people do not relocate&#8212;in effect, the bedroom tax can work only if it does not work. The stated aim of the policy, according to UK ministers, is to encourage people to relocate to a smaller property, but it will not save money, as Mr Rennie alleges that it will; it will simply be ineffective.</p><p>Mr Rennie accused members of being spineless. I know that I am not, because if I lacked a spine I would be getting annual invitations to see Atos, to find out whether it had grown back and I was capable of work. That is the process that disabled people are having to go through, as though a miracle can have somehow occurred in the previous 12 months. I have heard tales of people who are, in effect, in a childlike state because of brain injuries but who are constantly invited back, as if the brain injury will have gone away in the 12 months since they were last assessed. Such bureaucracy will clearly cost money to administer, as well as being utterly degrading for the people who go through it.</p><p>I will focus on a couple of cases to do with autism, which is an issue that is close to my heart. I mentioned one of them in last Thursday&#8217;s debate. Tracy Mahoney is a Castlehill Housing Association tenant in Sheddocksley, in Aberdeen. She has two sons: Bradley, who is 14 and has additional support needs; and Jason, who is 11 and has autism. They live in a three-bedroom house, which was given to them because the paediatric consultant said that Jason required a bedroom to himself because of his behavioural and sleeping issues. Tracy is now losing &#163;50 a month as a result of the housing benefit underoccupancy rule, although she needs a bedroom for Jason as a result of his autism.</p><p>Today in the Daily Record, we read about Sandy Miklinski, a 27-year-old with autism, and his experience of assessments for DLA and for work capability. The people who assessed him admitted to having little understanding of autism and what it entails, but he has been put into work situations that are clearly not suitable for individuals with autism. Welfare reform might be necessary, but what is also necessary is an understanding of the conditions with which people present, so that people can be treated as humanely as possible. Autism is a difficult disability to recognise, because it does not present through physical symptoms, but it is crucial that people understand it before they consider putting a person into a workplace that might prove stressful and counterproductive for them.</p><p>Vulnerable people are not asking for much. UK ministers appear to be putting forward the view that the welfare state is a comfort blanket. It is not a comfort blanket; it is a safety net. As Michael McMahon said, the UK Government is widening the holes in the safety net, so that more people fall through it. The poor are hit by welfare cuts at the same time as the rich get tax cuts. I could sum up the UK Government&#8217;s logic as, &#8220;The rich will work harder if we give them more money and the poor will work harder if we give them less money.&#8221; The approach is ridiculous and inhumane and attacks the most vulnerable people in society. The UK Government ought to be ashamed of itself.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689043", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Welfare Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I do not want to get hung up on the bedroom tax and spend the entirety of my speech on that topic, but I want to mention it briefly at the beginning; it will also come up in one of the case studies to which I will refer.

I am sure that she was not 10&#8212;I think that she will find that it was her 11th birthday rather than her 10th birthday.</p><p>Mr Lamont&#8217;s point that we surely would not want to go back to what life was like before Thatcher brought to mind the book &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; by George Orwell, in which the animals are constantly told by the pigs that, although things might be bad right now, they would not want Farmer Jones back and to go back to the way that it was before. The idea is that things might be bad now, but they were a whole lot worse before. John Lamont also told us about the Conservative Party&#8217;s bid to tackle the culture of entitlement. When I am being lectured on the culture of entitlement, I always think of those silver-spoon inherited millionaires in the Tory Cabinet.</p><p>A number of Conservative members mentioned the quote on which the debate is founded and said that Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s comments were about individuals&#8217; reliance on the state for support. Why she did not just say that, instead of saying that there is no such thing as society, only she would have known. However, people can often require the support of the state as a result of the policies of the state. When the state&#8217;s economic policies have led to individuals becoming unemployed and, as a consequence of that unemployment, losing the roof over their head, it is perfectly acceptable for those people to feel that the state has some duty to house them.</p><p>The notion that the state has a role&#8212;nay, a duty&#8212;to provide support is absolutely one of the bedrocks. The state&#8217;s duty to protect its citizens extends beyond defence of the realm and is as much about social and economic policy as it is about defence policy. Nobody is born into our society owing it a thing, and we should never think that that is the case; however, it does not mean that the state does not have duties towards people even if they have not yet made any contribution to society.</p><p>I take a different view on the right to buy from that articulated by some members. I consider that the right to buy was absolutely the wrong policy, not just because its mechanics did not allow for the replacement of the social housing that was sold off but because, by its creation, it established a stigma around the concept of home ownership, rental and social housing in general&#8212;a stigma that persists to this day.</p><p>Although the Scottish Government has taken the not only welcome but necessary step of ending the right to buy, that stigma around home ownership and rental is being entrenched as a result of the introduction of the vile bedroom tax by the Government south of the border. I accept that the bedroom tax applies not only to those in housing association or council homes but to those in the private rented sector, but we should accept that the measure is part of the overall stigmatisation of those who do not own their home because of their personal economic circumstances or simply because they choose not to do so. We should never forget that choosing not to own a property is a valid choice.</p><p>One consequence of the bedroom tax has been highlighted in my area of Aberdeen by a constituent, Tracy Mahoney, who came to me following the publicising of her case. She has a son who is autistic and who requires his own bedroom because his sleeping patterns are disrupted. He and his brother need to have separate bedrooms so that they can both get a good night&#8217;s sleep and so that their lives can have some form of normality. Tracy has been affected by the bedroom tax and the policies that the Government down south is pursuing. That flies very much in the face of the notion of the state supporting individuals and ensuring that those who require help receive it.</p><p>The debate is on the concept that there is such a thing as society. Therefore, having done a little deconstruction of some of the Thatcherite myths that are often perpetuated, I will end on an uplifting note that I think underlines the fact that, here in Scotland, we have a strong society. I will tell the story of a little boy in Aberdeen called Baxter Dick, who is 18 months old and who has spina bifida and hydrocephalus. He requires a buggy with supportive seating to help with his positioning, but it costs about &#163;3,000, which his parents cannot pay. They have therefore taken a novel approach and set up a website called &#8220;Baxter Needs A Buggy!&#8221;, which they highlighted through Facebook and their friends and family.</p><p>So far, 134 people have contributed through the website to raise the &#163;3,000 necessary to buy Baxter his buggy and ensure that he can get around and enjoy the most fulfilling life. His mother made it clear when she spoke to the Aberdeen Evening Express that she and Baxter&#8217;s father could not have done that without the help of other people, some of whom did not even know them and who had no connection to them whatsoever. To me, that is what society is about&#8212;it is about individuals looking out for one another.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688868", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Society"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, grew up during the Margaret Thatcher era.

I would have thought that, of all the people who would have joined in condemning the UK Government&#8217;s approach to benefits, Labour members would be among them, but apparently not.</p><p>A number of my colleagues have made an important point regarding social cohesion: why it is important to consider universal benefits as being part of the social fabric. The point was made in evidence to the Health and Sport Committee in a written submission from Dr Gerry McCartney, the head of the public health observatory division at NHS Health Scotland. He said:</p><p>&#8220;there are numerous dangers with a policy approach which reduces universal provision of services (e.g. means-testing prescription charges, school meals, dentistry and pensions) as this undermines the collectivism which supports taxation to pay for these services, increases stigma for those who use the services and results in reduced investment and reduced service quality&#8221;.</p><p>We believe that those who are paying into the pot, often at a higher rate, should be entitled to receive something back at the end of or during the process.</p><p>On prescriptions, I have been receiving missives on Twitter from Labour councillors, saying that we are giving free prescriptions to rich people. No&#8212;we are giving free prescriptions to sick people. There is a difference. Illness does not take account of someone&#8217;s income when it hits them. Therefore, they should be entitled to the same rights as anybody else who is struck by illness.</p><p>The point about stigma is important. If two people are in the chemist to get their prescriptions and one has to pay at the counter while the other does not, that immediately indicates that one is on a low income but the other is not. That creates a stigma for the person who is receiving the free prescription in that they are marked out as somebody who requires the help of the state, rather than as somebody who is entitled to the help of the state. That is an important distinction.</p><p>On the issue of affordability, I have to laugh at the juxtaposition of the points that Labour members have made. They wave around the not-so-secret document and quote things from it that are already in the public domain.

I know that many people are happy that the bill&#8217;s current definition of a high hedge will solve the vast majority of high hedge problems, the typical scenario involving fast-growing conifers.</p><p>Although the current definition includes hedges containing deciduous trees and shrubs as long as they do not form a majority of the hedge, I have been conscious that that definition would not deal with problems caused by high hedges that are wholly or mainly composed of deciduous trees or shrubs. Although wholly deciduous high hedges would typically pose less of a problem than coniferous hedges in respect of forming a barrier to light, I want to ensure that the bill solves as many problems as possible. I therefore have sympathy with people whom I have spoken to or who have written to me about problems with deciduous hedges.</p><p>For me, the question has been whether the bill can be extended in that respect without causing problems for its operation in practice. Some of the potential problems have been highlighted in correspondence, to which Patrick Harvie alluded and which members will have recently received, from the Scottish Wildlife Trust and RSPB. Their correspondence re-emphasises the points that they raised at stage 1 about the greater wildlife and biodiversity value of deciduous trees in comparison with conifers, and it underlines their concerns about the potential for a wider definition to have a negative impact on biodiversity.</p><p>Those are important issues, which deserve serious consideration, and officials supporting me in relation to the bill met representatives of both those organisations at a very early stage in the bill&#8217;s development to ensure that my consideration has been fully informed. As a result of that, I am aware that there are already many measures in place to protect wildlife and biodiversity, ranging from legislation such as the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 to local authorities&#8217; biodiversity action plans. Local authorities will need to take all those protections into account in making decisions regarding high hedges, and I am satisfied that they are capable of doing so.</p><p>For that to happen in practice, it is important that the guidance that the Government is to issue on the operation of the legislation provides full details regarding those matters. I have discussed the issue with the minister, and he has agreed that the Scottish Wildlife Trust and RSPB will be invited to contribute to and comment on the guidance before it is published to ensure that it fully addresses their concerns. I have written to both organisations to confirm that, and I hope that they will accept the minister&#8217;s invitation to participate actively in the development of the guidance.</p><p>I have been keen to ensure that the bill provides local authorities with a means of resolving disputes without demanding that they find additional resources to do so. I was pleased that the Minister for Local Government and Planning wrote to local authorities at stage 2 to consult them on the potential impact of widening the bill&#8217;s definition. I believe that the majority of the issues that local authorities raised about that potential impact can also be addressed through the guidance that will be produced by the Government. I know that local authorities will be fully involved in that, and I welcome the minister&#8217;s confirmation that the initial meeting to discuss implementation earlier this week was a positive one.</p><p>The main issue that cannot be addressed by way of guidance relates to the concerns that were expressed by some authorities about the potential for additional costs to be incurred in dealing with deciduous hedges. I am satisfied, however, that the bill provides that local authorities can charge on a cost recovery basis, and that the flexibility exists for different fees to be charged for different types of case, should local authorities choose to do so. That should enable local authorities to address any issues around additional costs should that prove to be necessary in practice.</p><p>Taking all of that into account, I am happy to support Anne McTaggart&#8217;s amendment 5, and I urge all members to do likewise.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688233", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High Hedges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I have taken the bill forward I have been keen to listen to the views and representations of members, interested organisations, professional bodies and members of the public.

That much was apparent from early in the process, even before I introduced the bill, when my final proposal obtained cross-party support. I am grateful for the on-going interest, support and encouragement that I have received from fellow members&#8212;as well as for the casework, which has helped to shape the bill. The legislation will meet a clear need and desire expressed by people in Scotland in their engagement with Parliament on the issue.</p><p>I have found that taking forward the legislation has been very rewarding, but I am conscious that this is not the first time that Parliament has considered high hedges and that legislation on the matter has a long history. Indeed, proposals for member&#8217;s bills on the issue were launched on three previous occasions, without those ever proceeding to be considered as bills. I am therefore pleased to be completing a piece of unfinished business.</p><p>The then Scottish Executive consulted on the issue in 2000, although the number of responses was relatively small in comparison with the number received in response to a similar consultation in England and Wales the previous year.</p><p>The more recent consultation undertaken by the Scottish Government in 2009 attracted in excess of 600 responses, of which 93 per cent were from private individuals, the majority of whom described themselves as being &#8220;in dispute&#8221;. Not surprisingly, a significant majority of respondents&#8212;77 per cent&#8212;favoured a legal solution to the problem, and more than two thirds favoured replication of the English and Welsh legislation. I am grateful to Fergus Ewing, who had already done a substantial amount of work on the issue when he had ministerial responsibility for the area, not least that of leading the work behind the 2009 consultation. That gave me a strong basis on which to build my own proposals.</p><p>Both I and the officials working with me have met many people and organisations in the course of preparing for the bill and taking it forward, including the Scottish tree officers group, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scottish Court Service, the Scottish Mediation Network and the Woodland Trust. I also visited South Tyneside Council and Hartlepool Borough Council for a first-hand account of how similar legislation works in England, and met with the campaigning organisation Scothedge a number of times. The officials supporting me have met a further range of organisations, including the Scottish Wildlife Trust, RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and the directorate for planning and environmental appeals.</p><p>We heard earlier that the Scottish Wildlife Trust and RSPB Scotland have recently written to MSPs to express their concerns about the inclusion of deciduous shrubs and trees in the bill, and I have acknowledged their concerns about the potential impact on wildlife and biodiversity. As I said earlier, I am satisfied that the guidance to be provided by the Government on the bill can address those issues and ensure that those potentially negative impacts do not arise in practice. I am therefore grateful that the minister has agreed that both the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the RSPB will be invited to participate in the drafting of guidance on the bill. I am happy, too, that Scottish Natural Heritage has already indicated a willingness to participate in developing the guidance, as it, too, has invaluable expertise to share. I am also grateful to the minister for ensuring that local authorities have been consulted on the potential impact of widening the bill&#8217;s definition of a high hedge. I know that many of the issues raised in response to that were considered at the Government&#8217;s meeting with local authorities on Monday to discuss implementation.</p><p>One of those issues is the impact of the bill on woodland or forests, which Stewart Stevenson raised at stage 1. The short answer is that this is a bill about high hedges, so it is not designed to impact on woodland and forests, which as a general rule are not planted as hedges. I confirm that the Forestry Commission has been consulted during the bill&#8217;s progress, and I am sure that the issue can be clarified in guidance to practitioners.</p><p>I now turn to the bill itself. It has become clear to me&#8212;I am sure that many members across the chamber will recognise this&#8212;that there are a number of apparently intractable disputes across Scotland that revolve around the presence of a high hedge, with no easy resolution in sight and no apparent willingness on the part of neighbours to resolve those disputes amicably. In my view, the bill is the best way in which to achieve a practical and sustainable resolution to a long-standing problem. I will now take a short time to explain the bill.</p><p>The bill enables those who consider themselves to be adversely affected by the height of a high hedge to apply to their local authority for a high hedge notice. It gives those people an opportunity to put their arguments to an independent body and to have their voices heard, which is an opportunity that they do not have at present. It is important to note that an application must specify all the steps that have been taken to resolve the dispute prior to the application, and local authorities will be able to dismiss applications if that has not been done. The local authority will decide whether the hedge is adversely affecting the reasonable enjoyment of the applicant&#8217;s property. In doing so, it will take account of the views of the owner of the hedge and all relevant factors, including the amenity of the wider area.</p><p>The bill&#8217;s definition of a high hedge has been the subject of much discussion. The bill as introduced mirrors the definition that is used elsewhere. It defines a high hedge as a hedge&#8212;that word is important in making it clear that the bill will not usually impact on forests or woodland&#8212;that</p><p>&#8220;is formed wholly or mainly by a row of 2 or more evergreen or semi-evergreen trees or shrubs&#8221;,</p><p>that</p><p>&#8220;rises to a height of more than 2 metres&#8221;</p><p>and that</p><p>&#8220;forms a barrier to light.&#8221;</p><p>The amendment that the Parliament has agreed to today widens the definition to include deciduous trees and shrubs by removing the restriction.</p><p>The bill gives local authorities powers to make and enforce decisions about high hedges. They will be able to assess situations and make independent decisions on whether high hedges are affecting the reasonable enjoyment of properties. It is fair to point out, however, that the local authority&#8217;s decision will seek to strike a balance between the competing rights of neighbours, and the representations of both parties will be taken into account by the local authority. It must make a decision having taken all the circumstances into account, including the amenity of the wider neighbourhood, and if it finds that a high hedge is having an adverse effect, it must advise whether any action should be taken.</p><p>Where the local authority decides that action should be taken, it will issue a high hedge notice. The notice will set out what initial action is required to be taken to address the adverse effect and what preventative action is required to prevent the adverse effect from recurring. The high hedge notice will also set out the timeframe within which action should be taken.</p><p>The bill provides a right of appeal to the Scottish ministers against decisions by local authorities. In practice, appeals will be heard by the directorate for planning and environmental appeals, and it will issue full details of how that process will work in practice in due course.</p><p>If an owner of a high hedge does not take the action that is specified in the high hedge notice, the local authority will have the power to enter the property and undertake the work itself. It will then be able to recover the costs of doing so from the hedge owner. In summary, the bill provides a mechanism for resolution.</p><p>Recourse to the local authority is, however, to be used as a last resort. Primary responsibility for resolving disputes over high hedges should lie with the individuals concerned in the first instance. As I said, the bill requires that applicants for a high hedge notice must have taken all reasonable steps to resolve the matter before they make an application to the local authority.</p><p>The success of that approach is borne out by experience elsewhere. In England and Wales, what started off as a large number of inquiries became a number of formal applications, which quickly became a small number of formal complaints and almost no instances of enforcement action. It is important to emphasise that the application to the local authority should be the last resort, not the first.</p><p>The bill also provides for local authorities to charge for high hedge notice applications. In difficult financial times such as these, I consider it important to enable local authorities to recover the costs of making a decision. However, I made it clear at the outset that I do not intend the process to be a revenue raiser for local authorities, and the bill reflects my view. Fees must not exceed an amount that local authorities consider represents the reasonable costs of deciding on an application. Should a local authority undertake work in relation to a high hedge, it will be able to recover any costs in that regard as well.</p><p>As I said, it appears from the figures that we gathered in respect of England and Wales that a large number of initial inquiries became a small number of formal complaints and even fewer cases where action by local authorities was necessary. That experience shows that simply creating a formal mechanism for resolving disputes encourages the resolution of most cases without the need for local authority involvement. At stage 1, Scothedge said that, with the passing of the bill, 92 per cent of the cases of which it is aware will resolve themselves. Local authorities can therefore have some reassurance that the costs associated with the process should not be too high and that the number of cases involved should be manageable.</p><p>I was interested to hear all the evidence at stage 1. I took the opportunity to attend all the committee&#8217;s evidence-taking sessions. There was a lot of useful evidence from a number of organisations including Scothedge, the Woodland Trust Scotland, RSPB Scotland, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and Bell Ingram, and from officials from the Isle of Man, the Scottish tree officers group and Dundee City Council. We heard evidence that indicated that similar legislation is in daily use elsewhere and that there is no reason why the approach could not work in Scotland. The evidence also indicated that the existence of the legislation, rather than necessarily its enforcement, will resolve many of the problems associated with high hedges.</p><p>Much of the discussion at stage 2 centred on the meaning and definition of a high hedge. That discussion continued today, and I was pleased to support Anne McTaggart&#8217;s amendment this afternoon. That amendment will widen the scope of the bill to ensure that it can deal with all hedges that are impacting adversely on the reasonable enjoyment of domestic property.</p><p>At stage 2, members were also interested in the fee provisions, which I have described. I emphasise that the bill provides the flexibility for local authorities to set their own fee levels in accordance with local circumstances.</p><p>A significant collective effort has got us to this stage, and for those who will implement the bill, the hard work is just beginning. I am aware that the Government held an implementation meeting on Monday in Edinburgh with local authority representatives and others. The meeting considered crucial matters, such as when the bill will be implemented, when local authorities will be ready to work with the provisions, what guidance for members of the public might contain, how members of the public might meet pre-application requirements, approach neighbours and make complaints and what the process would be thereafter. The meeting also considered what guidance for practitioners might contain, as it might also address the factors that a local authority might consider when making decisions.</p><p>The intention is that the guidance will be developed over the next six months or so to enable local authorities to make the necessary financial and organisational changes to implement the new powers in the next financial year. I look forward to the legislation being fully in place and used effectively.</p><p>I am therefore pleased&#8212;indeed, delighted&#8212;to move,</p><p>That the Parliament agrees that the High Hedges (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688273", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High Hedges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to open the debate, Presiding Officer.

First, I thank the members of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee, which was the lead committee on the bill and which provided robust and thorough questioning and scrutiny as the bill progressed through stages 1 and 2. I thank, too, the Finance Committee, which robustly questioned me on the bill&#8217;s financial aspects, mostly through questions from the convener, Mr Gibson. I also offer thanks to the Subordinate Legislation Committee, which diligently examined and considered the subordinate powers in the bill, which led to amendments that have been agreed to.</p><p>I thank all those who gave evidence to the committees&#8212;those who attended in person and those who took the time and trouble to write to the committees, often highlighting their own experiences. There are many people outside the chamber who perhaps did not submit evidence to the committees but who nonetheless showed a keen interest in the bill.</p><p>I thank my assistant, Aissa Watson&#8212;who was highlighted by Kevin Stewart&#8212;who has, since I announced my intention to introduce the bill, been regularly fielding inquiries and suggestions from many members of the public and, indeed, many members of the Scottish Parliament. At the start of the process, the queries that Aissa dealt with were about what would be in the bill and what it would cover. The queries that she deals with now are about when the bill will come into effect. It is clear from the case load that she has developed over time that there is a huge amount of interest in the bill.</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to thank to David McLetchie, who took an interest in the issue and was extremely supportive of my efforts at the outset, and who proved to be of great assistance in the early stages of consulting on the bill. It is appropriate that I put my thanks to him on the record. [Applause.]</p><p>The debate today has been constructive and consensual. Sarah Boyack made the point in her opening remarks that not everybody will be happy as a result of the legislation&#8217;s coming into force. However, the point that she made&#8212;and which I have made repeatedly during the bill&#8217;s process&#8212;is that the bill is not intended to be anti-hedge legislation; it is pro-dispute resolution. In the resolution of any dispute, or any high hedge dispute, the outcome will be that one party will be viewed as the winner and the other will be viewed as having lost. However, the point of the bill is to find a way to resolve disputes, and we hope that local authority action will lead to that.</p><p>I envisage that it is likely that the provisions will come into force&#8212;after local authorities&#8217; guidance and implementation work has been undertaken&#8212;some time in early 2014. In essence, we are serving notice to those who are in dispute that there is, from now, a year for them to resolve their disputes amicably before the legislative remedy comes into force. I hope that that call will be heeded and that we will see many current disputes being resolved amicably.</p><p>I felt that it was important to intervene on Margaret Mitchell earlier just to make it clear that single deciduous trees are not included in the revised definition, although the review section allows a future committee to examine the definition, should it so wish.</p><p>I am grateful to Anne McTaggart for her constructive engagement during the bill&#8217;s passage and for being willing to discuss the best way in which to frame the amendment, which she later lodged, to ensure that it had the most impact. I welcome the fact that we have been able to agree the amendment that she lodged.</p><p>Christine Grahame&#8217;s speech was as colourful as her speeches always are. In fact, we have been thinking about marketing her submission at stage 2 as a gardening book. We think that it could be a nice little sideline, given the expertise in horticulture that she demonstrated. However, she pointed out that I had a difficulty at the initial stages in weighing up which route to go down with the bill. Should I go down the route of the court-based solution that was mentioned during the debate, or should I go down the route of a local authority based solution? I felt that the latter would provide the best means of resolving disputes without their becoming snared up in legal process.</p><p>Christine Grahame also made the point that people often purchase leylandii as a focal point without necessarily understanding the impact that they can have. When I launched the bill at the Mill Garden Centre in Armadale, Joe McIndoe, its owner, made it clear to me that he wants people to be given sensible advice about the impact that such plants can have when they come to purchase them. I hope that one thing that might happen as a result of the bill is that people will consider what they plant in their gardens and the impact that it might have on their neighbours.</p><p>Stuart McMillan spoke about the review provision that he introduced. That was a sensible addition to the bill because it means that the efficacy of the legislation will be looked at, and that can include what has not been included but might be included in the future. As well as the issue of single deciduous trees, there are issues around the possibility of future fee-transfer mechanisms, which I know Margaret Mitchell wanted to talk about at various stages. It might be that we could learn from the example that exists in Northern Ireland. It will also be possible to look at what is in the legislation, how effectively it has worked in practice and whether changes or modifications are needed.</p><p>Jackie Baillie made an important point. There has been some cynicism out there&#8212;believe it or not&#8212;about the worthiness of our debating the bill. Both Jackie Baillie and Kenneth Gibson brought to the chamber stories of individual cases that highlight to us the impact that situations can have on individuals. Some people out there might suggest that the bill is not worthy legislation for us to debate, but I would say that before they seek to be cynical about it, they should talk to people such as the constituents who contacted me during the progress of the bill, listen to their concerns and hear how happy they are made by the passing of the bill.</p><p>I say to Kenneth Gibson that I was a bit worried when he started his speech that he might be heading towards a rather interesting editorial in the Buchan Observer, but I think that he managed to resolve the situation in that regard. [Interruption.] Stewart Stevenson is suggesting that he has already drafted a press release, so who knows? We might have some interesting discussions to follow.</p><p>It has been clear throughout the process that a lot of people have campaigned on the subject for a very long time. I thank those who engaged with me during the process, particularly the members of Scothedge; I see some of them up in the gallery today. Not everybody whom I engaged with has been able to make it to Parliament today, but a number are here. It has taken a deal of resolve for the campaigners to pursue the matter because, as we have heard, there have been a number of disappointments for them along the way. There were a number of moments during the campaign when they thought that they were not going to see legislation coming into force; there were a number of false starts.</p><p>The campaigners diligently kept pressing and kept coming back to try to ensure that Parliament not only took cognisance of their concerns but continued to pursue and advocate on their behalf, given the very real issues that they face. It is a great credit to Dr Colin Watson, who I see in the gallery today, and the members of Scothedge that they have continued to pursue the matter over a long time. I hope that they will be satisfied not just that the decision is being reached today, but by the way in which Parliament has conducted itself in coming to the decision, given the consensual nature of the process and the debate.</p><p>Sarah Boyack highlighted that consensual nature, and it has been reflected in amendments having been accepted. Because of how the numbers stand, I could have simply rejected amendments from Opposition parties, but I thought that the most important thing to do was to listen carefully to the arguments that lay behind those amendments. That is why I was able to accept some of Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s amendments at stage 2, and I was pleased to be able to accept Anne McTaggart&#8217;s amendment and Stuart McMillan&#8217;s amendment at stage 3. Amendments have been accepted from across the chamber.</p><p>The legislation has been a long time coming. Scothedge has always said that what it wanted to see in Scotland was better legislation than exists elsewhere. I hope that, today, we have done them justice.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688273", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High Hedges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I need to offer thanks to a number of people.

As members will be aware, dementia is an issue that is close to my heart&#8212;I will say more about that later. In addition, I have an interest in it as co-convener of the cross-party group on carers and of the cross-party group on dementia.</p><p>I met Tommy Whitelaw in June 2011&#8212;on my birthday&#8212;in Aberdeen&#8217;s St Mary&#8217;s cathedral. It was quite a birthday present, Tommy. It is good to see him here in Parliament today. While we were there, we spoke about his campaign and I shared with him my family&#8217;s experience. My mother was carer to my grandparents. My grandmother had dementia for 11 years and lived with my mother in my mother&#8217;s home for six of those years, along with my grandfather, although he passed away in 2010. My grandmother passed away in October 2011.</p><p>I agree with Jim Hume that dementia is a horrible, cruel illness. I have often said that my view is that dementia is an illness that kills a person from the inside out, in the sense that what you are left with is, essentially, a shell that looks very much like the person you know and love, but one from which the essence of that person, which made them the person you know and love, has long since disappeared, although occasional glimmers reappear. That was the case with my grandmother.</p><p>I am deviating from my notes, but what was interesting with my grandmother was the way in which she would react to my children and my brother&#8217;s children&#8212;her great-grandchildren. She seemed to have an enormous affinity with babies and small children. She would always light up when they came to visit her, whereas she would treat my mother and her siblings as strangers, despite the fact that they were the children whom she had raised. I was always struck by that when I visited my grandmother.</p><p>I saw at first hand the many difficulties that my mother faced as a carer. In the initial stages, she tried to juggle sustaining employment with her caring responsibilities. Eventually, she had to leave her job and focus fully on caring. Difficulties are created by the pittance that carers receive as a carers allowance. Jim Hume mentioned the &#163;10.3 billion annual savings that the state accrues as a result of carers doing what they do. Despite that, the Department for Work and Pensions deems it not to be a job and pays a pittance by way of the carers allowance. That is extremely regrettable, and it certainly does not help carers to do the very tough job that they do.</p><p>My mother received great support from Alzheimer Scotland throughout the process, for which she and my family remain grateful. Indeed, my mum is currently fundraising for Alzheimer Scotland, despite the fact that my grandmother has not been with us for more than a year, because we recognise the work that that organisation delivers across our communities.</p><p>Jackie Baillie mentioned a carer in the Highlands who had been assisted by 104 care staff. Using my Poirot-esque powers of deduction, I concluded that she was referring to Jeanette Maitland of Kingswells in Aberdeen, who had 106 carers visiting to attend to her husband. I met Mrs Maitland at a carers event in Aberdeen and visited her at her home to discuss the issues prior to their becoming public. Jackie Baillie&#8217;s comments on that jogged my memory. That issue highlights the importance of continuity of care, particularly for individuals with dementia. One noticeable point is how such people react to familiarity and having the same person visiting them. Constant change upsets individuals with dementia, so it needs to be avoided.</p><p>It is important to ensure that adequate and appropriate support is in place for carers. I note from a briefing that was provided for the debate that three quarters of carers say that their health is worse because of their caring responsibilities. We must address that; otherwise the people who are today&#8217;s carers will become the people who are tomorrow&#8217;s cared for.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22687267", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Dementia Carers&#8217; Voices"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to Jackie Baillie on securing the debate.

Different sides in the cold war propped up despotic, despicable regimes in order to further their own foreign policy ends. Those who justify international intervention in a nation to enable regime change should remember that the reason why Chile ended up with Pinochet was international interference to instigate regime change.

The first is sustained employment, and the Scottish Government is asked to</p><p>&#8220;appoint an Autism Employment Ambassador to champion opportunities for people with autism in the workplace.&#8221;</p><p>The report&#8217;s authors go on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Local councils should map the need for employment support in their areas and include employment support for people with autism in their local plans.&#8221;</p><p>The second priority is choice and control. The report&#8217;s authors say:</p><p>&#8220;With effective transition planning and support after diagnosis, people with autism should be empowered to advocate for themselves. The availability of, and need for, independent advocacy services should be mapped across all services that people with autism need to access.&#8221;</p><p>The third priority is challenging discrimination, and the report says:</p><p>&#8220;The negative attitudes many people with autism experience are debilitating and must be challenged with a concerted campaign to raise public awareness and understanding of autism.&#8221;</p><p>Finally, on professional knowledge and access to support, the report says:</p><p>&#8220;Sensitively handled, the experience of getting a diagnosis and support to understand its implications can make a huge difference to personal happiness.&#8221;</p><p>The Scottish Government is asked to consider a national health service health improvement, efficiency and governance, access and treatment target, to deliver post-diagnostic support. The report goes on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Local authorities should invest in specific services that help address social exclusion and the challenges of self-advocacy among people with autism from across the spectrum&#8221;.</p><p>On employment, 43 per cent of graduates or postgraduates with autism never achieve any sort of managerial position. Thirty-one per cent of people with a higher national certificate, higher national diploma, degree or postgraduate qualification are unemployed. Half the people with autism who were surveyed for the report have experienced career regression and are consistently failing to achieve the average earnings of their peers. Some 24 per cent have not had paid employment since they were 18, and 66 per cent rely to some extent on their families for financial support.</p><p>Of the people who were surveyed, 53 per cent wanted support with employment, 39 per cent had lost a job due to their autism, 36 per cent said that they had experienced discrimination or unfair treatment at work and 55 per cent wanted help with developing social skills.</p><p>From my discussions with individuals, at the reception and in the community, I have been interested to learn that people with autism do not need massive changes to be made to the workplace environment to enable them to sustain employment. Employers should take an active interest in considering whether they could do something in that regard. At Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body question time, I asked about accreditation for visitors to the Parliament, and I have spoken to local representatives of NAS about whether it would be worth having some form of accreditation or kite mark that employers could achieve, to demonstrate that they provide an autism-friendly workplace, not just on the customer-facing side of the business but for their employees.</p><p>At the reception, we heard from Michael Clarkson, a gentleman with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. He spoke of his experiences and his difficulties in finding a suitable job. It was interesting to hear him talk about his hobby and passion, which is cricket scoring, and his achievement of becoming a member of the International Cricket Council&#8217;s European scorers panel. His experience exemplifies the talents that people with autism and Asperger&#8217;s syndrome have, which could be utilised in the workplace if employers took a more sensitive approach.</p><p>On choice and control, 91 per cent would like more say over the support that they receive; 66 per cent have not made use of an advocacy service; 16 per cent currently have access to advocacy; and 37 per cent would like advocacy support. It is important that what is being asked for here is, first, the ability to self-advocate where possible. Many people with autism and Asperger&#8217;s syndrome are perfectly capable of self-advocating. Where that is not possible, the ability to access advocacy services absolutely has to be available.</p><p>On the issue of challenging discrimination, 79 per cent of those surveyed think that the public&#8217;s understanding of autism is poor or very poor, and 78 per cent of young people with autism think that people outside their family do not know enough about autism. Sixty-five per cent of young people with autism have been bullied at school; 33 per cent of adults have experienced bullying or harassment at work; and 36 per cent have experienced unfair treatment or discrimination at work. I will return to that issue in my closing remarks.</p><p>On professional knowledge and access to support, 33 per cent say that it has taken three years or more to get a diagnosis; 42 per cent say that the process was too stressful; 27 per cent say that they have been misdiagnosed; and 6 per cent have paid to access diagnosis.</p><p>Those who have spoken about autism, both on the record and to me, acknowledge that it is a great relief when a diagnosis arrives&#8212;not just to the individual but also to their family. They can then access the necessary support services that are available. We must do everything that we can to ensure that that diagnosis is both prompt and appropriate.</p><p>I said that I would come back to the issue of discrimination. We entrust many of these targets to the Government. I know that the minister has taken on board the recommendations and fed them to the national reference group that he has established as part of the autism strategy. However, there is one target that falls not just on the shoulders of Government, but on the shoulders of us all. That is the issue of challenging discrimination. I was privileged to speak at the recent Aberdeenshire conference on autism, where I talked about addressing the societal perceptions that exist and the duties that we all have.</p><p>I am a parent of an autistic child. My son is four and was diagnosed with autism when he was three. I have encountered the discrimination and difficulties that can arise because people do not understand autism. People give looks and tuts; they offer advice about how you should be looking after a child who is having an autistic meltdown that is, frankly, completely inappropriate. Other parents have experienced great difficulties, too. I heard about a wee boy who was the only child in his playgroup not to be invited to one of his peers&#8217; birthday parties because of the way he behaves as an autistic child. Imagine the hurt and damage that that can cause children and their families.</p><p>The challenge for us all, in all walks of life&#8212;whether as parliamentarians who have the privilege of being able to express our views to the organs of the press, or as individuals in our communities, talking to people and challenging stigmas and attitudes where they arise&#8212;is to ensure that discrimination about autism ends. We want to see a time when we do not need to campaign for understanding and acceptance of autism because people with autism are accepted, understood and recognised as the valuable part of our community that we all know them to be.</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686991", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Count Us In (Autism)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At this morning&#8217;s Health and Sport Committee meeting we had a discussion about the national autism strategy.

I do not want it to be simply a political aspiration for Scotland to be the best place in the world for children to grow up in. All parents aspire to that for our children.</p><p>I was interested that Mr Bibby&#8217;s speech focused on the need for reality to match rhetoric. He went very big on how we need to support children in our most vulnerable communities, but he may want to look at the reality of places in which his party has some locus of control. In my home city, for example, his party is currently in the administration in Aberdeen City Council and is consulting on closing Bramble Brae primary school. That school is situated in the Cummings Park community of Aberdeen, which is one of Aberdeen&#8217;s most deprived communities. Perhaps Mr Bibby should talk to his local councillors in Aberdeen and ensure that their reality matches the rhetoric that he is putting forth in the chamber.</p><p>Along with Mr Doris, I am a member of the Health and Sport Committee, which has been undertaking an inquiry into teenage pregnancy. We are also about to embark on what I suspect will be a significant inquiry into health inequalities. One interesting point that came out of the scoping exercise for that is that the application of the word &#8220;health&#8221; is almost a misnomer because, in essence, we are dealing with an agenda around inequalities in income and educational outcomes. All those issues work together to produce the inequalities in society.</p><p>In the teenage pregnancy inquiry, we have heard strong evidence on the benefits that have been realised in the family nurse partnership pilot areas. We have also heard great enthusiasm from the communities that are about to receive the benefits of the family nurse partnership when it is rolled out. Through that programme, the Government is taking an extremely strong step forward to support young mothers, who often need additional support at the beginning of pregnancy to help them as parents and to ensure that their children are given the most appropriate support. That is not to say that young mums are automatically bad mums&#8212;that is absolutely not the case&#8212;but it is a recognition that young mothers often need additional support early on to ensure that they become the best mums that they can be.</p><p>There is a recognition that more needs to be done, which is why the Government is, in partnership, bringing forward the strategies and actions that the minister outlined, such as those on the early years collaborative, to ensure that we continue to deliver for Scotland&#8217;s young people. However, it is extremely depressing that, whenever we talk about our aspirations and ambitions, we find ourselves hitting against a glass ceiling of reserved powers, which in many areas have a direct impact on our wish to develop the kind of Scotland that we want. That is why I find it difficult when Labour members on the one hand talk about wanting to tackle child poverty, but on the other hand beg us not to have the full range of powers here in Scotland. To me, that is simply a rhetorical mismatch.</p><p>I recently saw some internet traffic around supposed comments that had been made by a Labour Party spokesperson on the bedroom tax, so I looked at the &#8220;Daily Politics&#8221; interview with Helen Goodman MP. I encourage those Labour members who have not watched it to go and do so, particularly the point at which Helen Goodman says that the Labour Party has said that the bedroom tax should apply only in certain circumstances. To me, that is not being against the bedroom tax; it is being in favour of a different kind of bedroom tax. The Labour Party needs to have a look at that.</p><p>There is a notion that our aspiration for the Parliament is that we should simply act to mitigate the effects of bad decisions that are taken at Westminster, whether by the current Tory-Lib Dem coalition or by the hypothetical future Labour Government that Mr Smith and his colleagues wish for. If Labour comes into government in 2015, Liam Byrne will have his hands on the controls of the welfare system, and he has said repeatedly that Labour will continue to cut the welfare budget if it wins the election in 2015. No doubt, if Labour does that, Mr Smith will tell us that we need to take action to mitigate those welfare cuts, rather than argue for us to have the powers here to shape a fairer welfare system for the people of Scotland.</p><p>In my final minute, I will focus on the issue of additional support needs, which as members will know is extremely close to my heart. I have spoken to a number of parents in the north-east with whom I come into contact as a result of my son&#8217;s additional support needs. They told me about their aspirations, one of which is that</p><p>&#8220;young people need to be nurtured, challenged and accepted in an environment that works together to support the whole child.&#8221;</p><p>One parent said:</p><p>&#8220;I consider myself and my son to be fortunate in that his needs were picked up and identified early on and a programme of early intervention is put in place.&#8221;</p><p>I found myself in the same position.</p><p>Early intervention is crucial, as is the ability to get the right support at the right time. We must recognise that welfare reform presents significant risks, especially for disabled children and other children with additional support needs.

Following previous votes on the business case at the full council, yesterday the council voted to take things one step further. That will involve the transfer of 750 staff, three care homes and occupational therapy and rehabilitation services to the new arm&#8217;s-length company, Bon Accord Care Ltd.</p><p>Indeed, the council has also found within itself funding for the new trading company. Although it was interesting to hear Jackie Baillie talk about the need for tough choices being driven by budgetary pressure, the leader of Aberdeen City Council announced at the budget-setting meeting in February that there would be no cuts in the council&#8217;s budget. Clearly, that is due to, for example, a strong funding settlement from the Scottish Government and good stewardship of the council&#8217;s finances by the previous administration.</p><p>It is interesting that a consultant has been hired as part of the establishment of the local authority trading company. The consultant will form part of the management team. Indeed, he is named as a director and sole shareholder in Bon Accord Care. The council will pay &#163;42,800 for 12 weeks&#8217; work&#8212;a pro rata salary of &#163;170,000 a year, which is more than the chief executive of Aberdeen City Council is paid.</p><p>When challenged about the expenditure, Len Ironside, the social care convener, said:</p><p>&#8220;These are the experts&#8212;they have set up these types of companies before.&#8221;</p><p>In effect, he is saying that it is because they are worth it. Many people in Aberdeen city would question whether the council should be spending that amount of money on a consultant to deliver social care services.</p><p>However, there are not only concerns there. Indeed, the chief executive of NHS Grampian, Richard Carey, has stated his concerns that the</p><p>&#8220;creation of the LATC does not prevent integration ... It does, however, restrict the range and nature of the partnership ... we have expressed concern to the council that the opportunities for integration to deliver best value through changing service delivery may be restricted. It is therefore not integration that is potentially at risk, but the ability of the eventual partnership to deliver the changes as required in reshaping care for older people ... The opportunity to look at innovative staffing models on a joint basis is severely restricted ... the LATC was described by the council as remaining &#8216;100% under council control but would compete in the marketplace, effectively selling services to people who can afford it and are willing to pay&#8217;. If there is an inability to recruit home care staff, the available hours of care should be directed towards those in most need, not those who can pay ... The ability to pool the budget and use resources flexibly across health and social care is impacted upon as the LATC plan involves issuing a 5-year contract for &#163;26 million ... This will restrict the ability and flexibility of the partnership to reallocate resource to match the assessed needs of the population as described in the joint strategic commissioning plan. The flexibility normally associated with a contracting model of procurement is restricted ... Savings made or profits generated by the LATC shall either be redirected by the LATC to create other services ... or result in profits returned to the council ... It is difficult to visualise how this will enable the integrated partnership to make the savings necessary to generate additional capacity to support the increasing number of older people in the local population ... integrated partnership will be required to create a strong ethos of partnership not only between the NHS and social work service but also with the third and independent care sectors. We are very aware of the concerns being expressed by both the third and independent care sectors of the competitive nature of the LATC, and this may have implications for the partnership.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-03-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22686008", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adult Health and Social Care (Integration)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Gosh, Presiding Officer.

She should at least have the humility to accept that the reality does not match up to her rhetoric.</p><p>Let us compare the situation with the one that existed under Labour. If the current situation qualifies as a scandal, one can only imagine how Jackie Baillie would have referred to the Labour Party&#8217;s record on the matter, when around 35,000 people were stuck on waiting lists with no waiting time guarantee and when no statistics were published on the length of their wait. That is a scandal&#8212;the situation that Ms Baillie reported as such is not.</p><p>The notion that the Labour Party is putting across that everyone on social unavailability codes has been parked or put there inappropriately, which Jackie Baillie directly implied in her speech, is frankly untrue. There are perfectly good reasons why people find themselves socially unavailable. I could have been socially unavailable last year had the surgery that I required been available only in the months during which Parliament was in session.

It is important not to lose sight of these in favour of throughput and patients being seen quickly.&#8221;</p><p>Let us look at some of those statistics. Since 2008, there has been a 12.4 per cent reduction in hospital mortality, which equates to the saving of 8,500 lives. There was a 24 per cent reduction in the number of C difficile cases and a 10 per cent reduction in MRSA/MSSA cases in 2011-12. Between 2007-08 and 2011-12, there was a cumulative fall of 78 per cent in C difficile cases and 35 per cent in MRSA/MSSA cases. That shows that real progress has been made on hospital-acquired infections, which belies the rhetoric of Jackie Baillie, who tried to paint Scotland as the hospital superbug capital of Europe but forgot that she was referring to figures for when her party was in power.</p><p>There have been 272,000 alcohol brief interventions to tackle harmful and hazardous drinking over the past four years. The emergency bed days rate for people aged 75 and over has reduced by 10.9 per cent since 2006-07, and 48,000 inequalities-targeted cardiovascular health checks were delivered in 2011-12. Scotland&#8217;s suicide rate reduced by 17 per cent between 2002 and 2011. Those are real results for real patients in Scotland. The BMA has been instructive in advising us to look at what lies behind the statistics. We should always remember that it is the outcomes for patients that matter.</p><p>That is why it is important to look at and compare patient satisfaction ratings. We can never be complacent about the NHS because, as has been made clear, it is a human organisation and errors will occur. Indeed, even in the Labour Party, errors, such as bringing this debate to the chamber, occasionally occur. The task that we must face is to learn the lessons from the errors made by human organisations and understand how to put them right.</p><p>The Labour Party&#8217;s real game was given away by its press release in advance of this debate. The aims are, first, to attack Nicola Sturgeon, because Labour recognises that she is quite rightly viewed as an asset not only to this Government but to the nation and, secondly, to save Jackie Baillie&#8217;s rapidly diminishing credibility after she overcooked the pudding on the NHS waiting time scandal.

We can make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up in partly by ensuring that children themselves grow up in a loving and nurturing environment.</p><p>Part of that environment will be developed through stable relationships between parents, but we must accept that there will be situations in which relationships will break down, for whatever reason. The most important thing is that the children&#8217;s rights are considered, and that includes considering the rights of both the mother and the father. The father&#8217;s rights are all too often forgotten in the process. We absolutely have to put the child at the centre, but we must not forget that there are two other players as well, and the father often gets left out.</p><p>Anne McTaggart helpfully summed up the range of family models that now exists in Scotland, none of which should be considered to be any less worthy than another, as children can be given a loving and nurturing environment in a range of ways. However, I want to focus on two specific groups. There are fathers who live with their partner and child. I am a father of two young children. I live with my wife and, obviously, we have our children with us. Those of us who are in such a position still need to be given support in the role of father. No father is ever handed an instruction manual on how to do the job, and support networks sometimes quite rightly in many ways focus heavily on the mother&#8217;s role and on directing support towards them. However, there can be times when the father needs to be given a bit of support in performing his role. How our public sector organisations include and seek to include fathers needs to be looked at. I will perhaps discuss that a little bit more a little later.</p><p>There are also fathers who live apart from their partner for whatever reason. The most important issues in that context are around access rights and custody. I sometimes wonder whether, in looking at access rights, for example, there is still a harking back to the Victorian attitude of the distant father and the nurturing mother, as if fathers somehow do not really need to have access to their children because they do not take as active and interested a role. How we view fathers and the role that they play also needs to be looked at.</p><p>On the wider support networks, obviously there is the support that can be provided through the public sector organisations. Voluntary groups have also been established, and groups of dads come together. Dads rock, which was in the Parliament recently, has established itself very well in Edinburgh and is now looking to branch out into other local authority areas. I told it to give me a shout when it comes to the north-east, although, given that it is based around a musical environment and I cannot carry a tune in a bucket, I do not suppose that I will be much help to it.</p><p>Fathers of children with complex support needs and disabilities also need to be seriously considered, particularly fathers who live apart from and have only very limited access to those children. How we support those fathers in their role as a father and in providing the support that they can provide to their children in those circumstances needs to be looked at.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22685247", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families Need Fathers"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my colleague John Mason on securing this debate.

Anne McTaggart said that 50 per cent of the Scottish Government&#8217;s cuts are impacting on local authorities, which I am sure was news to her front-bench colleague Sarah Boyack, who has been telling us that the proportion is 83 per cent. That is perhaps proof positive that Labour&#8217;s figures on local government funding are a wee bit madey up.</p><p>I congratulate the committee on the work that it has done on the area, which is a key challenge for us. Public sector reform should be regarded as not just a challenge but an opportunity to revitalise the delivery of our public services.</p><p>On community engagement, I was struck that Graeme Downie from NESTA said:</p><p>&#8220;Communities can be seen simply as those to whom services are done. Ironically, if you engage them at the earliest possible stage of policy development, you always end up with the best outcome.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 28 March 2012; c 814.]</p><p>That is certainly something that my colleague Kevin Stewart and I learned when we became part of the Aberdeen City Council administration. The way in which the council carried out its budget process did not take that engagement into account. In essence, figures were publicly available for two to three weeks in which there was a rush to find savings in order to make the budgets balance.</p><p>Kevin Stewart, who was the finance convener at the time, took the decision to move back the process and engage with communities at a much earlier stage. As such, communities felt that they were involved in the budget process rather than it simply being something that happened to them. The resulting benefits were not only that communities felt more involved but that their suggestions often found their way into the council&#8217;s budgets.</p><p>Community engagement is laudable, but it must also be tinged with realism. Communities will obviously want to have certain things, but those things cannot always be delivered. There must be a realism that communities cannot always get everything that they want out of a process. Most communities are realistic about that and they genuinely appreciate being consulted and having their views taken on board. Often, those views shape the policies and approaches that are taken.</p><p>Partnership working and the shared service agenda are not only about spending less money. A lot of the work has been driven by the financial constraints that are being felt across the public sector, but the agenda is pushing something that could realise greater opportunities for much more efficient working and better outcomes for communities. A reluctance&#8212;a silo or protectionist mentality&#8212;exists in some services that is acting as a barrier; there is also a lack of genuine discussion on some of the approaches that are being taken.</p><p>We have seen that happen in advance of the forthcoming health and social care agenda in Aberdeen. The local council proceeded with a local authority trading company for the provision of social care services. NHS Grampian has raised concerns about that and the impact that it could have on extracting the best possible outcome from the health and social care partnerships. The response from Labour Councillor Willie Young, Aberdeen City Council&#8217;s finance chair, to NHS Grampian to &#8220;Get off our lawn&#8221; does not strike me as the most mature way to carry out discussions between public bodies about how they realise the best possible outcome for public sector reform.</p><p>I note that the committee unanimously supported the shift towards a preventative spending approach. Preventative spending, by definition, is about a transfer of resource. However, the transfer of resource in and of itself is not enough; we need a change of mindset and culture in our local authorities and public services about how they translate the shift in budget to a difference in how they deliver services on the front line.</p><p>It is depressing when we see local councils turning down opportunities. For example, the administration in Aberdeen rejected the opportunity offered by the SNP group as part of the budget process to invest significant sums in education and early intervention within regeneration communities in favour of proceeding with the pedestrianisation of Union Street, which is something that, frankly, nobody in Aberdeen has been calling for.</p><p>A lot of good work is being done. The committee certainly cannot be accused of not going out and looking for best practice and, when it finds it, reporting on it. We should build on that work where we can, but we also need to look at areas where there are blockages and work out what those blockages are. Far too often those blockages are about the mentality of the individuals involved, whether they are at the elected member or the senior officer level. Something needs to be done to instigate a culture shift in organisations to ensure that the people who need to take the decisions to move towards a much more cohesive agenda on public service integration are able to do so.</p><p>Money is often the driver for decisions but, just because finances are tight and we are moving towards a preventative spend approach, that does not mean that that is a bad thing. There is a lot of opportunity as a result of the public sector reform agenda, and we must ensure that we capture it all.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22684930", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Services Reform (Developing New Ways of Delivering Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is a well-known fact that 74 per cent of statistics are made up on the spot.

It is the furthest that any high-hedge proposals have got in the history of the Parliament, and a great deal of work has gone into the bill to get us this far.</p><p>I and those supporting me have met a number of people and organisations from throughout Scotland and elsewhere. Tony Dixon from Hartlepool Borough Council and Simon McGinnety from South Tyneside Council, both of whom I met in December 2011, were able to give me a great deal of assistance in understanding how high-hedges legislation has worked elsewhere.</p><p>Ian Edwards, Elspeth Forsyth, Steve Milne, Robert Paterson and Eric Hamilton from the Scottish tree officers group provided me and the officials supporting me with much expertise and advice&#8212;I hope that they will continue to do so.</p><p>I thank Joe McIndoe, the owner of the Mill Garden Centre in Armadale, West Lothian, who kindly allowed me to use his garden centre as an excellent venue for the launch of the bill last October.</p><p>I am also grateful to Scothedge, which has campaigned for such legislation for many years and which has engaged positively with me throughout the process.</p><p>I make it clear at the outset that the bill is not an attempt to define the height of every hedge in Scotland. Many people who own, or live adjacent to, a high hedge will have no issue at all. I seek not to create disputes were none exist but to resolve existing ones.</p><p>It is clear that a number of intractable disputes revolve around the presence of a high hedge. The problem is that there is no way to resolve them if there is no willingness to do so amicably. By introducing the bill, I have sought to provide a mechanism to remedy that.</p><p>The Scottish Government consulted on the matter in 2009. That consultation gave an indication of the extent of the problem. There were more than 600 responses, 93 per cent of which were from private individuals, many of whom described themselves as being in dispute.</p><p>The bill aims to provide an effective means of resolving disputes about the adverse effects of a high hedge where the issue has not been amicably resolved between neighbours. It acknowledges that the individuals involved should have primary responsibility for resolving such disputes.</p><p>The bill defines a high hedge. The definition largely mirrors the one that is used elsewhere, and I am pleased that, in the stage 1 report, the majority of the committee agreed with the definition. I will refer to that report a little later.</p><p>The bill gives home owners and occupiers a right to apply to a local authority if it is considered that a high hedge adversely affects the reasonable enjoyment of property. However, although the bill provides a mechanism for resolving disputes, it also provides that pre-application requirements must be met. That means that applicants must have taken all reasonable steps to attempt to resolve the dispute beforehand. Recourse to the local authority should be the last, not the first, resort.</p><p>The bill empowers local authorities to make and enforce decisions about high hedges. It gives them powers to assess the situation and act as an independent and impartial adjudicator of whether a high hedge is affecting the reasonable enjoyment of property. We must bear it in mind that that means that local authorities will seek to strike a balance between neighbours&#8217; competing rights. Authorities will also need to consider a hedge&#8217;s effect on an area&#8217;s amenity and whether the hedge has any cultural or historical significance.</p>", "hdate": "2013-02-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22683416", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High Hedges (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you very much, Presiding Officer.

I am aware that a number of people who responded to the committee&#8217;s call for evidence addressed that point. Some evidence suggested that the definition should be broader and some evidence suggested that it should be narrower.</p><p>I think that the committee&#8217;s majority conclusion is the right one and that the bill strikes the right balance.

Otherwise, there are no such restrictions on the location of the hedge. The hedge could be situated on land that is owned by the local authority. Nothing in the bill prevents a high-hedge notice from being issued against a local authority. Indeed, the appeal process builds in a further safeguard, should there be dissatisfaction with the outcome of any adjudication in that regard.</p><p>I am happy to agree with the committee&#8217;s recommendation that the bill should be amended to include the national park authorities as statutory consultees. That request was made by one of the national parks and was supported by the Scottish tree officers group in its written submission.</p><p>The committee also recommended that a review provision be included, on which Mr McMillan helpfully suggested that he would seek an amendment. I am happy to take that forward.</p><p>I noted the committee&#8217;s conclusions in respect of the provision in section 34, the intention of which is to allow the current meaning of a high hedge that is contained in section 1 to be amended by regulation. I also noted the Subordinate Legislation Committee&#8217;s different interpretation of the width of the power in section 34. It expressed the view that</p><p>&#8220;it appears to be possible for that power to be used in the future so as significantly to alter the scope of the Bill&#8221;.</p><p>I am keen to hear the members&#8217; views on that provision in the debate, following which I will consider what action might need to be taken. As part of that process, I will assess how addressing the points that the committees have made might impact on the bill. I will give further consideration to the matter and will contact both committees to confirm my intentions ahead of stage 2.</p><p>The Local Government and Regeneration Committee noted the concerns that were expressed in evidence about how the bill&#8217;s provisions relate to tree preservation orders. I said in my evidence that in circumstances in which a tree preservation order might be in place, high hedges would be</p><p>&#8220;dealt with through a pragmatic approach, which will not be frustrated by other legislation and will ensure that protections for valuable trees are kept in place.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Local Government and Regeneration Committee, 19 December 2012; c 1570.]</p><p>I am glad that the committee is satisfied with that approach.

The first one that we should spend some time on is the definition that is used in the bill. Some members asked why I did not widen the definition. Kevin Stewart and Stewart Stevenson helpfully referred to the experience in the Isle of Man. Its system is not entirely analogous to the one that I have proposed&#8212;the Isle of Man has pursued the issue in a different way&#8212;but we should look at the experience there. The assessments that are required for deciduous vegetation are often highly complex. The fact that a 12-month inspection process is necessary to establish the impact of a particular tree or group of trees must be built in as a cost factor. That could be recoverable by the local authority, so it could lead to the attachment of a substantial fee. My view is that we need to allow the legislation to bed in and to look at how the fee system works in practice before we can look at the possibility of widening the bill&#8217;s scope. I will come to that later in my speech.</p><p>I am grateful for Stuart McMillan&#8217;s having expressed his willingness to look at how a review mechanism could be incorporated in the bill. I think that that is entirely sensible for the reason that I have outlined. It is not just the definition that we would look to review. We have spent some time talking about the definition, but there are other aspects of the bill&#8212;for example, those to do with the fee system and the appeals process&#8212;that it would be worth looking at to ensure that they are working in the way that we envisaged.</p><p>I say to Christine Grahame that it is my understanding that privet would be captured by the bill, by virtue of its being evergreen or semi-evergreen, depending on where it is, but I am happy to look into that further on her behalf. Beech has characteristics that led me to feel that it should not be included in the scope of the bill, but I will be happy to reflect on that, to talk to her and perhaps to write to her after the debate to provide her with a little more detail.</p><p>In listening to some of Anne McTaggart&#8217;s and Helen Eadie&#8217;s comments, I was concerned that the position that Labour had taken in committee to back the proposed definition seemed to be changing substantially. I have outlined why I drafted the definition in the way that I did. I will listen to members&#8217; points, but they must accept that a change to the definition will have a knock-on effect on other aspects of the bill. The definition cannot simply be viewed in isolation.

The minister was quite right when he said that the mechanism for which the bill provides was not intended to be a revenue-raising mechanism for local authorities. Indeed, the evidence from south of the border is that it would be particularly foolish for any local authority to assume that it could use it as a revenue-raising mechanism, because the experience there has been that an initial flurry of inquiries leads to a much smaller number of formal applications, which, in turn, leads to an even smaller&#8212;a minuscule&#8212;number of occasions on which the local authority requires to take action.</p><p>I think that that bears out the comments by Colin Keir and Graeme Dey that the bill, simply through its existence as a piece of legislation, will regulate people&#8217;s behaviour. It will mean that, when an assessment is required and a remedial notice is served by an authority, people will take it seriously, will take the necessary action and will not seek to frustrate the process.</p><p>I have made it clear that I believe that it is for local authorities to determine what fees they will apply. The bill simply gives local authorities the ability to recover their costs. Some local authorities might choose not to do that; they might choose to structure their fees differently, depending on factors such as people&#8217;s incomes. That will be for local authorities to determine. In my time as a local councillor, if I had constituents beating down my door because they could not afford to access a particular council service, that would have led me to ask questions of the authority. There is that element, too. Council committees and councillors will ensure that any fee system that is put in place does not prohibit their constituents from accessing the process.</p><p>On the fee-transfer argument, I acknowledge the comments of Christine Grahame. Margaret Mitchell and her colleague Gavin Brown pursued the issue with me at the Local Government and Regeneration Committee and at the Finance Committee. We looked at the Northern Irish example, but it is still very much in its infancy and there are not a lot of data to establish whether the scheme has succeeded. I still retain a concern that with a fee-transfer mechanism we run the risk of adding to a dispute; for example, a neighbour would receive a remedial notice and comply in full with it, but would then be asked to pay a surcharge to cover the fee that their neighbour had paid. There is a potential risk of animosity being created in that circumstance. Again, though, I have said that I would look at the fee-transfer issue.

However, at the same time, there is a perception that child mental health or behavioural issues stem from poor parenting. Sometimes that is the case, but often they are a consequence of attachment issues that develop as a result of parental mental health issues, including, but not exclusively, post-natal depression.</p><p>Post-natal depression affects around 10 to 15 per cent of women. It is estimated that, for every 1,000 live births, 100 to 150 women will suffer a depressive illness. Studies have estimated that around 10 per cent of fathers can develop and suffer from symptoms and effects of post-natal depression; that should be borne in mind.</p><p>I noted a 2008 report, &#8220;The Effectiveness of Interventions to Address Health Inequalities in the Early Years: A Review of Relevant Literature&#8221;, which suggested further</p><p>&#8220;exploration of interventions that reduce risk for postnatal depression&#8221;.</p><p>That is because it is recognised that that has an impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children in the early years. I would welcome comments from the minister on how the Government sees post-natal depression fitting into the mental health strategy, particularly with regard to the application of the Edinburgh scale for post-natal depression.</p><p>I understand that the expectation is that all women should receive the Edinburgh scale. However, I have anecdotal evidence that some women, who have later been diagnosed with post-natal depression, were not given the Edinburgh scale to complete. That might not be widely prevalent, but perhaps the need to take cognisance of the Edinburgh scale needs to be re-emphasised to either health visitors or GPs&#8212;or, indeed, to both&#8212;when it comes to looking at women and women&#8217;s health postpartum.</p><p>I want to look at environmental factors, and a number of colleagues have spoken about welfare reform and the wider recession. The March 2012 report &#8220;GPs at the Deep End: GP experience of the impact of austerity on patients and general practices in very deprived areas&#8221; makes for sombre reading:</p><p>&#8220;A central concern of the Deep End practices is the number of patients with deteriorating mental health.&#8221;</p><p>Two ends of the spectrum were looked at. At one end, there are</p><p>&#8220;those who are in work, and previously well&#8221;</p><p>who found themselves under increasing stress in their jobs due to potential cutbacks and job security fears, and under the stress of taking on extra work or jobs, with the</p><p>&#8220;resultant impact on family and relationships&#8221;.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, there are</p><p>&#8220;those with chronic mental health issues and established physical problems who are &#8216;deemed fit to work&#8217; and have their benefits cut.</p><p>Those people are</p><p>&#8220;struggling to make ends meet ... increasing contact with GPs and psychiatry ... increasing antidepressant/antipsychotic use ... self-medicating with drugs and alcohol&#8221;.</p><p>A number of testimonies were borne out in the report. One GP said:</p><p>&#8220;I observe this again and again that I cannot address medical issues as I have to deal with the patient&#8217;s agenda first, which is getting money to feed and heat.&#8221;</p><p>Another said:</p><p>&#8220;In my surgery I am hearing from patients who for 2-3 days a week cannot afford to heat their houses (many use metered cards which are more expensive than direct debit payments).&#8221;</p><p>Then there was a kind of gallows-humour comment:</p><p>&#8220;For obvious reasons, the patients in X ... area ... call Corunna House [where the Work Capability Assessments are done] &#8216;Lourdes&#8217; because all the sick come out cured!&#8221;</p><p>That emphasises that the work capability assessments do not necessarily take cognisance of some of the very real issues.</p><p>The Royal College of Psychiatrists states that</p><p>&#8220;recessions have been shown to be accompanied by an increase in the suicide rates. The people most at risk of suicide at this time are those who are experiencing financial problems.&#8221;</p><p>Evidence from the Centre for Welfare Reform showed that 45 per cent of people in debt have mental health problems, but that only 14 per cent of those who are not in debt have such problems. The centre&#8217;s hypothesis is that poor mental health is linked to real poverty, which I think has been borne out by some of the evidence.</p><p>There is also an issue about the pressure that is experienced on the front line. When I was a member of the Finance Committee, I asked questions of Dr Margaret Somerville, from NHS Highland. She said:</p><p>&#8220;I have not talked much about mental health issues, but we expect an early impact on mental health services and particularly on primary care services. Again, we need community resilience and support. Uncertainties and unknowns produce stress in people, which leads to depression and anxiety. That will have an impact on primary care and on our mental health services.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance Committee, 12 June 2012; c 1388.]</p><p>That shows clearly that welfare reform will have an impact on services.</p><p>Stigma about mental illness still exists in many ways, which makes people more reluctant to come forward about their illness. Depending on the walk of life in which people operate and work, they might not come forward because they consider that to do so will impact on their job security. We must do all that we can to tackle stigma. I think that the mental health strategy will play a strong part in that, and I very much welcome it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22682576", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Mental Health Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I associate myself with my colleague Kevin Stewart&#8217;s remarks about our former council colleague, Jim Kiddie.

The alternative would require the whole funding settlement to be reopened with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. It is not only me who is satisfied. A recent front page of the Evening Express stated that there was a guarantee from the council administration that there would be no cuts in the coming financial year. That suggests not only that Aberdeen is receiving a good level of funding from the Scottish Government but that the previous council administration&#8212;on which I served, along with colleagues of Willie Rennie&#8212;left a good legacy due to its work on getting the council&#8217;s finances back in order.</p><p>This is a budget that will deliver.

Willie Rennie spoke about the impact of the UK budget on low-income families. I invite him to look at his own Government&#8217;s budget figures, which show quite clearly that the budget policies that his party is supporting in government in Westminster are to the detriment of people on low incomes. When he does so, I hope that he will come back to the chamber and admit that the UK Government&#8217;s budget measures will negatively impact on the lowest paid in our society and on low-income households.</p><p>We must also factor in welfare reform. One of the great misconceptions around welfare reform is that it does not impact on those in work. However, we have already heard a lot of evidence&#8212;in the Welfare Reform Committee and in wider society&#8212;that many people in low-income jobs rely on benefits as well as the income that they receive. There will be negative impacts on them as a result of UK Government policies. Although the Scottish Government can use its powers to mitigate those negative impacts to some extent, we simply cannot wipe them all out.

For example, those of us who have relations in other countries find it much easier to communicate with them and share what is going on in our lives.

It has been fantastic for that.</p><p>We should also accept, though, that the internet is a place of great dangers. The anonymity that it offers to users makes it a place in which bullies can operate with much greater impunity that in a physical environment. That is why a resource such as Kibooku is so fantastic and extremely welcome, given the figures on aggressive and unpleasant behaviours online and parents&#8217; worries about that.</p><p>My children are too young to use social media, but one day they will probably wish to do so and explore the internet. My son has developed something of an expertise with the touch-screen computer at his nursery, so it will probably not be too long before he tries to use computers to access the internet and all the opportunities that it will offer him. However, there are concerns about the dangers out there, which is why we require safe social networking and internet environments for our children.</p><p>We must accept that young children will want to use online resources. We can put in place firewall protection and parental controls, but there are only so many restrictions that parents can put in place. That is why I think that the parent-child element of Kibooku sets it apart from other social networking sites. The fact that the parent must be involved in the registration process differentiates it from other social media, which is extremely welcome. It provides the assurance to parents that their children are accessing something that is more secure and safe for them, and it allows the children to know that it is safe to use. Hopefully, they will be more willing to consider it than other social networking sites.</p><p>I look forward to the opportunity that will be presented tomorrow and I hope to find the time to be able to come and have a look at Kibooku in action. However, we should not allow other social networking forums and sites off the hook. It would be stretching it to assume that Mr Zuckerberg is sitting in Facebook headquarters right now watching a live stream of this debate, but he and his company and other social networking sites, be it Bebo, Microsoft Messenger or BlackBerry Messenger, must up their game and start taking more responsibility for the fact that they allow young children to access their sites without the proper verifications.</p><p>I have seen profiles of friends&#8217; children and of family members who are clearly too young to have their own profile according to the sites&#8217; rules but nonetheless have one.

I know that the minister is always keen to look at the example of Aberdeen City Council and its strong planning performance, but it was not always so. When I first arrived at the council in 2007, it was still operating a local plan that dated from 1991 because of a legacy of inertia and incompetence that had been left by previous administrations. The process of putting in a new local plan had been started by the previous administration in 2004 and was eventually seen through.</p><p>However, that led to a system of planning by appeal, in which any application that was rejected by the council was immediately appealed and, because of the lack of an updated local plan, the decision was more often in the hands of the Scottish Executive than in the hands of the local council and the planning committee. That led to friction and bad publicity for the planning process. I am thankful that a new local plan is now in place and that it was very well marshalled through by the previous administration. I hope that the current administration will continue with it.</p><p>During my time at Aberdeen City Council, I was very enthusiastic about and supportive of the charrette approach. Indeed, one of the three charrettes that was proposed during the 2006 to 2010 period was sited in my council ward of Dyce, Bucksburn and Danestone, at the Grandhome estate. It was an extremely large charrette that looked at developing not just a small planning area but a wider community that would consist of several neighbourhoods. It was designed to form a comprehensive network. Its point was about place-making, which was one of the themes that the minister discussed.</p><p>That event brought together community members, interested groups, councillors and a wide range of council departments to look at the front end of the process. It meant that a large amount of time had to be put in at the very outset, but the idea behind that initial input was to streamline the process of planning applications. Based on the Grandhome estate experience, the charrette approach certainly bears examination with regard to future developments in Scotland.</p><p>The approach also provided an opportunity to examine how one might develop an area and a community&#8212;indeed, a sustainable community&#8212;instead of simply taking the old approach of throwing up a few houses without providing associated amenities or any business infrastructure. The idea was to develop a community in which people could walk to and from school, their place of work or various facilities and, where that was not possible, to integrate in the community a bus network in order to provide sustainable transport.</p><p>However, the process also made it clear that attitudes have to change. I remember how, during the local plan process, a councillor from the neighbouring ward attempted to move to other sites in the city all the housing that had been set aside for Grandhome as a result of the charrette. That councillor&#8217;s view was that the move would lead to an overburdening of housing in the area, but they did not bear in mind that the charrette was attempting to achieve the creation of a more sustainable community.</p><p>With regard to transparency and accountability, I note that, in its submission, Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce makes the interesting point that producing a written statement of reasons in cases where committees go against the planners&#8217; expressed recommendation might lead to greater transparency in the decision-making process. Indeed, that might help developers and communities to understand why an application was approved or rejected against such a recommendation.</p><p>As for training needs, I note that the Royal Town Planning Institute has welcomed the extra funding for Heads of Planning Scotland, but has also suggested the creation of a knowledge portal to involve all players in the planning process. As well as training planning officials, we also need to train elected members in their planning responsibilities. One of my early experiences on becoming elected as a councillor was my being contacted by another councillor who wanted to discuss an upcoming planning application. As all of us should know, councillors are forbidden from discussing or declaring their position on planning applications in advance of the application being scrutinised, but anecdotal evidence certainly suggests that some councillors tell constituents how they intend to vote on a planning application before it comes before committee. That puts at risk not just the elected member, but the planning application and the integrity of the planning system itself. We must therefore ensure that councillors are included in any training.</p><p>Finally, I welcome the changes with regard to fees. After all, the disparity between the fees that are levied south of the border and in other parts of these islands, and those that are levied here has been an issue for some time, particularly in relation to major applications that are submitted by significant interests that have the money to pay higher fees. I welcome the minister&#8217;s comments in that respect and look forward to seeing the detailed proposals.</p><p>The debate is relevant, and I hope that the comments that are being made will shape the proposals that the Government introduces.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22681369", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like my colleague Stewart Stevenson, I have a family interest in the planning system; my uncle is a joiner.

My brother is employed in offshore health and safety, and my father owns and operates a business in the supply chain in the north-east.</p><p>I start with the supply chain and indirect employment. We often focus on those who work offshore or who are directly employed by oil companies, but there is a vast network of companies, businesses and jobs in the north-east that are dependent on the industry. It is not as simple as looking only at the companies that directly supply the industry; members need to consider, for example, the shops, hotels and other facilities within the area that depend on the industry for their income and their survival.</p><p>My colleague Kevin Stewart made the point that the transition needs to take time in order for it to bed in. I say to Patrick Harvie that that is a valid point because so much of the infrastructure is dependent on the sector and it is not just a simple case of making the transition quickly.</p><p>Having said that, I agree that the skills are transferable between the oil and gas and renewables sectors. Indeed, from the discussions that I have had with oil and gas sector representatives, it is clear that they are aware of the transferable opportunities and what those could realise for their businesses. They recognise that they operate within a sector that will not be around for ever due to the finite nature of the resource, but they also recognise that their businesses, companies and expertise can be around for ever if they diversify and take advantage of the transferable opportunities.</p><p>We have an extremely good and strong safety regime in the North Sea. Unfortunately, it has too often been shaped by tragedy. It has often been the case that the reaction to tragedies, such as those related to Piper Alpha or helicopter ditching, has resulted in good work being done by the industry and the unions to ensure that the health and safety of those working in the sector is paramount.</p><p>On the economic argument of the value of oil and gas, I noted the comments made by Kenny Paton, oil and gas partner at Bond Pearce, in the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce report:</p><p>&#8220;With a grim economic picture elsewhere in the UK Aberdeen is bucking the national trend. It is a beacon of activity attracting all sorts of professions seeking exposure to this market from accountants to IT and, of course, legal as well as those more readily associated with the industry.&#8221;</p><p>The fact that Aberdeen was the only part of the UK that grew during the recession demonstrates how important the sector is not only to the north-east but to the wider national economy.</p><p>I was interested in Mary Scanlon&#8217;s comparison of the value of oil and gas revenues and her statement that they account for only 0.7 per cent of UK gross domestic product. In that case, the UK will not miss them after 2014.</p><p>Skills shortages exist in the oil and gas industry, and the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce is doing work to address them. The skills survey identified that 68 per cent of contractors and 75 per cent of operators reported experiencing problems in recruiting suitable employees in particular occupations.</p><p>In my discussions I have noticed that there is a significant recruitment gap. A number of people are due to retire and, although there are significant numbers of new entrants into the workforce, there is a gap in the middle that needs to be filled. The difficulties faced relate to the existing immigration rules and controls that the UK Government is putting in place and which make it difficult to import skilled workers from elsewhere to come and work in the north-east and rest of Scotland. It is vital that those difficulties are addressed appropriately.</p><p>When I attended the recent your future in energy event in the north-east, at which young people from schools were given the opportunity to learn more about the oil and gas sector, I found it interesting how few of them understood the sector, even when they had parents and family members who worked in it. That spoke of an industry in which people do not share their experiences to a large enough extent.</p><p>That takes us back to the skills shortage argument. In the past, many have been put off a career in oil and gas as a result of unfortunate scare stories and tales of woe about the industry and its future viability. We finally have a consensus on the future viability of the oil and gas industry such that young people know that they can enter the industry when they leave school and have a full career in it if they wish to do so. If those truths had been told back in the 70s and 80s, we might not have been facing the skills shortages that we face now and our nation might have seen much more economic benefit as a result.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680996", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Oil and Gas Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am aware that time is tight and the length of speeches for final speakers has been reduced, so it is not my intention to take interventions.

I was a member of the Finance Committee for a large part of the inquiry, although that was some months ago. The committee&#8217;s inquiry and the debate are timely and I congratulate past and present committee members who have put the work into the report that we are discussing today. I also extend the greetings of the season and wish everyone a very happy 2013.</p><p>One of the things that comes across from the report and the discussions that the committee had when I was a member is that the key to the approach is partnership. No one sector has a monopoly of wisdom on, or responsibility for, delivering better outcomes and improving employability within Scotland, or for improving opportunities for young people who find it difficult to get into employment. All sectors and all organisations need to look at what they are doing&#8212;and at what they can do&#8212;to deliver better outcomes. I will focus on that theme during my speech.</p><p>Last year, I had the great pleasure of attending the inaugural discover opportunities awards at the West Park Centre in Dundee, which celebrated the work that the Dundee Partnership does to help to get people into sustainable employment. At the ceremony, a number of people were given awards for the work that they have done, both as employers and as employees, as a result of the schemes that have been set up in the area. The Dundee Partnership has done good work and should be looked at as a model that could be replicated elsewhere.</p><p>We can also look at models in other areas. I note that the written submission from Scotland&#8217;s Colleges mentions Dundee College&#8217;s pupil access to college and employability&#8212;PACE&#8212;programme and the successes there. The programme offers</p><p>&#8220;a full-time programme for pupils in their last 6 months of school and a part-time programme for pupils in their last 12 months.&#8221;</p><p>It often re-engages</p><p>&#8220;young people who have a range of complex needs and who have disengaged from mainstream educational provision.&#8221;</p><p>It provides</p><p>&#8220;48 full-time places and 32 part-time places&#8221;</p><p>and is open to</p><p>&#8220;young people who are affected by family circumstances; health or disability; social, emotional and behavioural difficulties or the learning environment.&#8221;</p><p>There is a crucial element to that&#8212;which I will come back to&#8212;in that it looks beyond the skills sets that we provide people with, to the lives and lifestyles that people lead. We need to consider that when we are looking at employability and at improving pathways to employment.</p><p>In that regard, I also highlight the example of Aberdeen Foyer, with which, I know, both the cabinet secretary and the minister are familiar and which does a fantastic amount of good work. My colleague Dennis Robertson&#8217;s comments about the buoyant economy of the north-east of Scotland are certainly true in the Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire context, but within that buoyant economy there are still pockets of deprivation, problems and individuals who find it difficult to access employment. That is why the work that Aberdeen Foyer does is so important. Its learning houses, which are based in Peterhead and Fraserburgh in Mr Stevenson&#8217;s constituency, offer training and support to people who might otherwise not be able to access such resources. It also has in place a Prince&#8217;s Trust team that provides a programme of individual challenges and teamwork in the community, thereby giving young people aged 16 to 25 an opportunity that enables them to develop their confidence, motivation and skills.</p><p>Aberdeen Foyer also has a get ready for work programme, which is designed to assist young people who may need additional support to make the transition beyond school into the world of work. The programme lasts for up to 26 weeks, although individuals do not have to stay for the entire 26 weeks, and some will not require to stay for that time. All those programmes demonstrate that good work is being done out there; we should be looking at that good work to see whether it can be replicated elsewhere.</p><p>We should also consider the role that community partnerships can play. In that regard, I commend the Aberdeenshire employability strategy, which has been produced by a range of organisations, including Aberdeenshire Council, Aberdeen Foyer and others. It includes a number of outcomes that the organisations want to achieve. I was interested to see that one of the outcomes is a reduction in homelessness, which they see as being crucial to dealing with employability.</p><p>That brings me back to the point that the issue is not just about skills sets; it is also about lifestyles. Who Cares? Scotland made that point in relation to care leavers. If someone&#8217;s background and lifestyle behind the world of work are chaotic or problematic and there issues within it, that will affect not just their ability to access employment or to be suitable for employment, but their ability to sustain employment. We need to bear that in mind as part of the debate. As members have mentioned, it is important not just to get people to the stage at which they can turn up for interview and succeed in getting a job, but to ensure that they have the ability and confidence to sustain that employment. That is why I believe that, if we were to look at the issue as being only about development of skills, we would miss the point. A much wider societal approach needs to be taken to ensure that people have balanced lifestyles, which will help them to sustain employment once they find it.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680834", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Employability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate.

Indeed, I think that I am right in saying that, of the original members of the committee at the start of this session of Parliament, only the convener and the deputy convener remain. I assure them that it is nothing personal.</p><p>We face tough financial times. We have already heard from the convener of the committee about the 11 per cent fall in revenue and the 26 per cent fall in capital that the Scottish Parliament and Government will receive as a result of the austerity measures that are being pursued at Westminster. That makes it all the more interesting that we are somehow supposed to dance with joy when crumbs occasionally fall from the Westminster table.</p><p>It is undoubtedly welcome that additional capital investment is coming to Scotland, but that does not disguise the fact that the UK Government remains committed to a wrong-headed austerity approach. We do not have to take the word of the Scottish Government for that; Nobel laureates such as Krugman and Stiglitz are out there saying that the focus should clearly be on economic growth. However, the chancellor has decided not to grow his way out of a recession but to cut his way out, which has been clearly demonstrated to be the wrong approach&#8212;not only for the economy but for the most vulnerable people in society.</p><p>The budget is about priorities. A Government, a Parliament and a nation that are operating within a shrinking resource and in tough financial times must make decisions about their priorities. This Government has made it clear where its priorities lie. It seeks, for example, to protect front-line health spending. That protection was unanimously backed in the Health and Sport Committee report&#8212;signed off by all members of the committee&#8212;which said that the best way to do that in these difficult times is to target the Barnett consequentials at territorial health boards.</p><p>There has been investment to maintain and uplift the living wage, and there has been an announcement that the pay freeze for public sector workers will end next year. It represents just a modest increase, but it is an increase, nonetheless.</p><p>The Scottish Government has also continued to invest in the universal benefits that benefit not only the most vulnerable people, but wider society. It was interesting that Kenneth Macintosh went with his &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221; theme because&#8212;as we all know&#8212;if it were up to the Labour Party, Tiny Tim would be paying for his prescriptions.</p><p>Use and deployment of capital expenditure to deliver economic growth is important. It is a key element of what the Scottish Government is trying to do, not just in terms of the capital investment that is coming forward as a result of the crumbs that are falling from the Westminster table, but in terms of the shift of resource to capital in order to try to boost employment and grow the economy within the limited powers that are available to us.</p><p>Another priority for this Government is the preventative spend agenda, which represents the shifting of significant sums of money in order to ensure that, instead of trying to deal with problems at the end of the process and tackling problems that arise, we get down to the root causes of the problems. Those causes are the societal issues that need to be dealt with by developing things such as family nurse partnerships, which ensure that people in the most hard-to-reach areas get the support that they require to prevent problems that might otherwise arise later in their lives. That requires a significant shift in funding, which this Government is providing and, crucially, it requires a significant change in the mindset of the public sector.</p><p>As parliamentarians, we must all do whatever we can to ensure that that change occurs, which is where I have a difficulty with the doom-mongering approach that Mr Macintosh so often brings to the chamber. We always hear from the Labour Party that it wants more money to be spent on this or that, but the politics of tough times require honesty from those who argue for additional spending.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680684", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I speak as another former member of the Finance Committee.

I also pay tribute to Sandra White, who did a fantastic job in standing in for Christina at such short notice.</p><p>I believe that, fundamentally, Scotland is and always has been an open, inclusive and welcoming nation. Migrants from across the world have enriched our land throughout our history. We can see that in our education system&#8212;last week we had a debate on Camphill Scotland, which was founded by Austrian migrants&#8212;as well as in our language, architecture, food, song, literature, wider cultural output, sport and even our politics, as my colleague Linda Fabiani has pointed out to me. She is of immigrant stock, and I am sure that everyone would agree that she has greatly enriched the politics of Scotland in her time.</p><p>The important point to mention is that &#8220;immigration&#8221; is not a dirty word. Far too often, politicians and commentators use the terms &#8220;migrant&#8221; and &#8220;immigrant&#8221; in a pejorative way, looking to cast a negative association with them. That is extremely dangerous rhetoric.</p><p>Helen Eadie was right to talk about times of economic difficulty. When we enter such times, there is often a tendency to look for a scapegoat&#8212;for a section of society that can be marginalised and blamed for the difficulties that ordinary indigenous workers are facing. Often, it is migrant communities that are targeted as the people who are taking jobs away from the indigenous workforce. We must be vigilant against that tendency and we must reject those sentiments, whether they are explicit or implicit. Some politicians will make such statements in a more explicit fashion than others, but the sentiment still exists, however it is put across.</p><p>We should also remember that migration is very much the key to Scotland&#8217;s future. We talk a lot about the demographic challenges that Scotland will face in the future when the number of people who require to be supported by the working-age population will put a strain on the taxation base of our nation. That is a simple fact. We have to find a way to increase the working-age population of Scotland, and the only way we can do that is to attract skilled migrant workers who will come to Scotland and make it their home.</p><p>The difficulty that we face in trying to do that is that we are living in a situation in which the Westminster Government is taking decisions on immigration that seek to solve a problem that does not exist in Scotland. We need immigration and we need to encourage it. I believe that immigration is fundamentally a good thing in and of itself, even if we take the economics out of the issue. When people come to Scotland from elsewhere in the world, it enriches our land&#8212;irrespective of the economic arguments&#8212;simply by increasing the diversity of our communities and by helping us to develop new experiences as a people.</p><p>I passionately believe that the only way we can continue the cultural enrichment that comes from migration, and which is celebrated through events such as migrants&#8217; rights day, is through Scotland&#8217;s having control of its own immigration system. People can say that that is a political point; it is, but I believe that it is the key to the issue, whether on the economic side or the cultural enrichment side. I believe that the UK Government is taking the wrong approach, which is based on the negative perceptions of immigration that I outlined. It would be far better if we had the powers here in Scotland to do things that are in Scotland&#8217;s interests when it comes to immigration. I look forward to the day when Scotland has its own immigration policies.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680273", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Migrants&#8217; Rights Day"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my colleague Christina McKelvie on securing the debate and send her my best wishes as she recovers.

I believe that it will make a key contribution to improving understanding of autism in the criminal justice system, and that it will have a wider application across the public and private sectors.</p><p>The card demonstrates a strong commitment from the organisations that have signed up to it, which include Grampian Police, NHS Grampian, the three north-east councils, Autism Initiatives Scotland, G4S, Grampian Autistic Society and The National Autistic Society. The input of G4S, which handles prisoner transfer, is an important facet, alongside Grampian Police&#8217;s involvement.</p><p>When I was offered the opportunity to speak at the launch event on 12 November, I said that I hoped that other organisations in the public and private sectors would look at ways in which they could buy into the process and make use of the autism alert card in order to help them and individuals with autism and Asperger&#8217;s syndrome who may use their services or frequent their premises.</p><p>The card has been launched to help to ensure that those with the condition are quickly identified and supported by Grampian Police and a range of partner organisations that I have just outlined. The National Autistic Society Scotland is heralding the card as a &#8220;breakthrough&#8221; for Grampian.</p><p>There are an estimated 50,000 Scots with autism, nearly 6,000 of whom are thought to live in the Grampian region. The card will include details of a personal contact who can lead police and other organisations through the best ways to help the individual with autism in what could be highly pressured experiences for them.</p><p>At the launch event we heard from David Silvester, a retired joiner from Moray who has Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. He said:</p><p>&#8220;On the outside I appear articulate and look like I&#8217;m functioning well. This could be a real problem if I&#8217;m a victim of crime or accident, because police will expect me to communicate and process information in the same way they do, and I can&#8217;t always do this.&#8221;</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;It would be great if the public could see that people with autism are not &#8216;weird&#8217; or &#8216;odd&#8217;. We just see the world in a different way. We have support needs, but also capabilities. For example, I&#8217;m very observant, and often spot the detail in a situation or conversation that many people might miss, so I could be an excellent witness. But the police would need to know the best way to communicate with me. That&#8217;s where the Autism Alert card could be invaluable.&#8221;</p><p>Sandy Fraser, who is 18 and from New Deer, and who has Asperger&#8217;s syndrome, also attended that event. In the press release that was issued following the event, he was quoted as saying:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an observant driver, but if I come into contact with the police the flashing lights, crackling radio noises, high visibility vests and the questioning could be confusing and overwhelming. I think the Autism Alert card is going to really help police resolve these kinds of situations with less stress.&#8221;</p><p>Karen Williams, who is the director of corporate services at Grampian Police, said that the card</p><p>&#8220;will allow our officers to quickly identify a card-holder&#8217;s condition, improve understanding of their needs and offer them the best possible support.&#8221;</p><p>The crucial issue is that understanding of autism be improved. Only a minority of people with autism come into contact with the criminal justice system as victims, witnesses, suspects or offenders, but they are vulnerable because of their social and communication difficulties. Making an emergency 999 call&#8212;many of us would take that process for granted&#8212;can be very difficult for someone with autism, as can giving a statement to a police officer following a burglary. The wider implications of the situation may not be apparent to them, and they can have difficulty in understanding the subtleties of language. For example, they often interpret statements literally, so if anyone uses figures of speech, colloquialisms, sarcasm or humour, that is often not relayed by the individual, which can often lead to their displaying what could be considered to be suspicious or difficult and challenging behaviour.</p><p>The card contains enough basic information to allow a police officer or other member of the emergency services to recognise someone with autism and support them through a range of situations. Police forces are also supported to identify training for their staff to improve their knowledge of autism. Some areas have produced short films to demonstrate the alert card in use in a variety of situations, such as at airport security, with a witness to a crime, or at a home fire-safety check. It should be noted that the Grampian autism alert card stands alongside cards that have been issued in Strathclyde, Lothian and Borders, and Highlands and Islands.</p><p>Although there has been no formal evaluation of the schemes yet, the National Autistic Society Scotland has said that there is informal evidence from people that the cards are helping. Users of the card have reported that knowing that they feel safer and more confident in public spaces improves their self-confidence. They also feel more confident when they come into contact with organisations. Police officers and others have said that they are helped to support people with autism better. That has led to the avoidance of more serious situations developing and has potentially avoided more costly interventions, which are often not needed.</p><p>We should note that the recent case of Gary McKinnon, for example, has much to teach us about societal and criminal justice attitudes towards autism and Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. Much still needs to be done to educate not just the public sector, but wider society and politicians about the difficulties that can be caused when people with autism or Asperger&#8217;s syndrome come into contact with the criminal justice system or other services. As we move to having a national police force, the Government and the national police force might consider whether the scheme could be replicated on a national basis. I know that the National Autistic Society is keen on that, and I am certainly keen on it. The anecdotal evidence that has been received certainly suggests that it is of benefit. I hope that the Government will consider progressing that.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Grampian Autism Alert Card"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank members of parties from all around the chamber who signed my motion, which has enabled it to be debated in the chamber.

I also thank Laurence Alfred of Camphill in Aberdeen for taking the time to show me around the campus on Deeside yesterday afternoon, and the many residents, pupils and co-workers from Camphill communities across Scotland who came to Parliament today. I had the pleasure of sampling what was probably the smelliest but certainly the tastiest cheese from the award-winning cheese range at Loch Arthur, as well as some of the jams that were on display. I have taken away an order form to ensure that I get my Christmas cheese board sorted.</p><p>What I saw when I visited Camphill yesterday was what I would consider to be the embodiment of whole-life learning and the notion that learning does not just exist in the classroom or the school but is part of life. That was very clear from the discussions that I had with Laurence as I was going around the site. Indeed, I was drawn to the Education Scotland report that Lewis Macdonald cited that was issued in January this year. It talks about the particular strengths of the school:</p><p>&#8220;Happy, relaxed children and young people who feel safe, valued and respected.</p><p>The dedication and enthusiasm of staff and their sensitivity to individual needs.</p><p>Use of the natural environment to develop children and young people&#8217;s communication, personal, social and vocational skills.&#8221;</p><p>We heard about the fantastic eco award that the Camphill school in Aberdeen received. The report goes on to mention:</p><p>&#8220;The breadth of the curriculum including therapeutic support services.</p><p>The effective implementation of a clear and shared vision for care and education of the coordinators.&#8221;</p><p>That speaks volumes for the school&#8217;s ethos.</p><p>During my visit, the community feel of the school campus was very clear. The community ethos is also demonstrated by some of the fundraising efforts that are taking place. Indeed, I note from documentation that has been provided to me that the school is trying to develop the swimming pool and intends to raise &#163;70,000 to spend on new equipment for the swimming pool.</p><p>The school does not just raise funds for local issues. The spring and summer school newsletter states that</p><p>&#8220;Camphill school Aberdeen has raised &#163;1029.00 for Tools for Self Reliance&#8221;</p><p>in Africa. That speaks volumes for the hard work ethos of the school.</p><p>One issue that was raised with me during my visit was the fact that the local authority has categorised Camphill as an out-of-authority school. Geographically, it is in the city of Aberdeen, but children who go there are categorised in the same way as if they were being sent on a placement to Cornwall or Bristol. The issue has been raised with the chief executive of Aberdeen City Council. Part of the getting it right for every child agenda should be that we look at the kind of environment that is provided at Camphill.</p><p>Another crucial issue is what happens to the funding for children when they reach 16. It is possible that such children might no longer be afforded the opportunity to remain in the Camphill environment, despite the fact that, on balance, it is probably the best thing for them. Local authorities need to consider that carefully when they take decisions regarding those young people.</p><p>People of my generation, and possibly people more widely in the north-east community, will probably be aware of Camphill in the context of the controversies that existed around the Aberdeen western peripheral route. It would be a great pity if that were the only thing for which Camphill was known. From my visit and from members&#8217; speeches, it is clear that there is a whole lot more to it and that people really should take the time to find that out.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679632", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Camphill Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Alison McInnes on bringing the debate to the chamber.

I wrote to her on 23 April, 6 July and 17 July but, on each occasion, she refused to visit. That puts into context the lack of interest with which the UK Government has viewed the situation of Remploy not just in Aberdeen but in Scotland as a whole.</p><p>The UK Government was ignorant of the social enterprise model that was being developed in Aberdeen&#8212;there was a clear lack of understanding of it. As my colleague Kevin Stewart pointed out, the UK Government also seemed entirely uninterested in the crippling rental burden that was being placed on Aberdeen Remploy, which absolutely affected the ability of that social enterprise hub to grow and flourish.</p><p>What is almost a phoenix from the flames has risen in Aberdeen, because seven of the 14 former Remploy workers have set up Aberdeen Textiles and Workwear Services as a co-operative. The other seven workers chose to take redundancy packages following Aberdeen Remploy&#8217;s closure. It has been reported that old and new customers have approached the new firm about possible business. However, although Remploy and the UK Government said that assets would be transferred, the workers in Aberdeen have not been able to obtain the hard drives from the former Remploy factory, which has hampered their ability to seek work actively and co-operate with former customers.</p><p>In a letter to me of 17 November, Esther McVey clarified that the factories would not be sold off en bloc&#8212;it had been feared that they would be available only for large private enterprises to purchase as a block. She also said:</p><p>&#8220;Along with Remploy, we are keen for the factory&#8217;s assets including fixtures and machinery to be disposed of in the best way, particularly where they may be used to support disabled people locally.&#8221;</p><p>Allowing the former Remploy workers in Aberdeen access to the computer drives from the old Remploy site would assist disabled people locally and would assist the new social enterprise in going forward. I encourage the UK Government to work with Remploy to make that happen and ensure that the new business continues to grow and flourish.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s response and the statement from the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism that he has visited all the sites that are part of stage 2. I point again to the response that I received from Maria Miller&#8212;a contrast perhaps exists between the Scottish Government minister&#8217;s willingness to visit Remploy sites and see the work that goes on there and the UK Government&#8217;s desire to sit in its Whitehall ivory towers and issue edicts, without going out and seeing the work that is taking place at the front line.</p><p>I am grateful that the minister has agreed to look at bringing forward a scheme similar to that in Wales. That will be of benefit in supporting workers who have been victims of the closures at stage 1.</p><p>Much has been made of the role that the public sector can play. The situation at Glencraft was mentioned. Its salvation, if you will, came as a result of a combination of the Scottish Government, the council and PSN coming into the situation. PSN helped in providing much-needed sales and marketing expertise. We have heard much about Remploy&#8217;s inability to go out and market its products. Remploy in Aberdeen would have been more than capable of competing for tenders if it was able to go out and actively market its products. PSN brought that expertise to the table for Glencraft, and the council reduced and deferred rents in order to allow the business time to grow, find its feet and develop as a social enterprise.</p><p>There is still a role that the council can play in Aberdeen. We have heard that the site in Aberdeen that Remploy formerly occupied is up for sale. When the site was closed, Kevin Stewart and I called on the council to look at the possibility of purchasing it through the council&#8217;s common good fund. The Aberdeen common good fund currently sits at &#163;73.8 million, with &#163;7 million in cash. It would be capable of absorbing the purchase of a &#163;250,000 or even a &#163;400,000 factory site. There would then be the option of renting the site back to a social enterprise hub at a market rate. The current co-operative is based at the Twin Spires business park site. The option of purchasing the former Remploy site through the common good account and leasing it back at a market rent in order to allow a social enterprise hub to develop&#8212;the idea was that the factory site is ideally placed to host a number of social enterprises&#8212;could and should still be explored. I call on Aberdeen City Council, not on a partisan basis, but on a constructive basis, to look at the opportunity that that presents. The site would be a common good asset and there would be a common good rental income. It would be a win-win situation for the council and the social enterprise community in the north-east.

Indeed, the report clearly distinguishes between the impact of APD rises on short-haul travel and that on long-haul travel. That is important in the context of debate about short-haul flights versus direct flights.</p><p>The report also focuses on the impact of APD rises on individual airports. Aberdeen airport, which is in my region, sustains the third-largest loss of passengers</p><p>&#8220;at around 200,000 passengers per annum by 2016.&#8221;</p><p>Patrick Harvie talked about the busiest October on record. Undoubtedly, there will be individual months when specific events taking place in the north-east encourage greater throughput of passengers, but it is worth looking at that figure as representing the overall picture. Indeed, the briefing provided by the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce said:</p><p>&#8220;Air travel is particularly crucial to this part of Scotland because we are so geographically distant from London and from Europe&#8217;s key cities&#8221;.</p><p>When an area is&#8212;as Aberdeen is&#8212;an extremely important part of the UK, Scottish and European economies, it is important to have some quick and readily available links in order to maintain a competitive edge.</p><p>It is worth noting that, since January, aviation has been included in the European Union emission trading scheme, which will play its own part in relation to the climate change agenda. It is also worth commenting that one reason for using APD is to encourage planes to be filled up, because that is perhaps not happening at the moment. Indeed, WWF is encouraging airlines to fill planes and to use more efficient aircraft, a point that my colleague Stewart Stevenson highlighted. Ways are being looked at to incentivise more environmentally friendly forms of air travel, including the use of taxation levers in order to encourage that.</p><p>We have heard the old refrain that APD is just a tax that we want to cut, but the obvious and important point to remember is that air passenger duty is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a progressive form of taxation. Regardless of one&#8217;s income level, one pays the same air passenger duty. All that that does is to put pressure on those on lower and middle incomes who may choose, as is their right, to use aviation as a means of transportation. It may be that some members want to see air travel once again become the preserve of the wealthy. That is fine if that is their position, but they should at least be honest about their intention.</p><p>It does not behove any of us to exclude large numbers of Scottish society from accessing air travel for whatever reason, whether business or, indeed, pleasure. I take Alison Johnstone&#8217;s point about the comparative spend analysis. I am a great fan of the staycation and I encourage people who live in Scotland to holiday here. However, at the same time, we must respect that people will want to choose, on occasion, to holiday overseas, and we should not put unnecessary impediments in the way of them making that choice. What we should do is to look at ways in which we can incentivise environmentally conscious and friendly means of transportation in the aviation industry.</p><p>I will always be willing to talk to members and to discuss with them how to operate incentivisation, but I absolutely disagree that we should hit people with sticks and expect them to modify their behaviour. That does not positively encourage behaviour modification; all that that does is make people resent the behaviour changes that they are faced with.</p><p>It is worth noting that VAT is levied on top of air passenger duty. The notion of levying a tax on a tax is born of a uniquely UK Government perspective. That is relevant to the issues that we are discussing.</p><p>I believe that the devolution of air passenger duty to the Scottish Parliament is essential. Alex Johnstone says that there is no guarantee that the duty would not rise. To him I say that the Government has set out its policy position and other parties can set out their policy positions. However, I also believe that, whatever decisions are taken, we would be in a position to decide air passenger duty based on the needs of Scotland.

Given the way things are going, he may yet get a second bite at that particular cherry.</p><p>I was pleased that Liz Smith acknowledged that there has been a cut to the Scottish budget. That was welcome, because her leader seldom acknowledges it, and her finance spokesperson does not acknowledge the cuts that are coming to the Scottish budget. Indeed, they go out of their way to pretend that the cuts are not happening. I therefore welcome the honesty brought to this debate by Liz Smith. Would that some of her colleagues would take a leaf out of her book.</p><p>At the same time, however, Liz Smith cannot come to the Parliament and realistically expect changes to be made to the funding landscape without shifting funds from other areas. I accept the points that were made in that regard, but what are the Conservatives doing? The Government in London ties our hands and picks our pockets. That is what is happening to the Scottish budget: our hands are tied in terms of how we can go about growing the economy, while at the same time this Parliament&#8217;s budget is being reduced.</p><p>The leader of the Conservative Party in Scotland made a speech in which she called for the tax take to be cut in Scotland. She wants income tax to be cut in Scotland, but not by just the 1p that would take &#163;0.5 billion out of the Scottish budget, as possibly more than &#163;1 billion would be taken out. The Conservatives then have the nerve to come to this Parliament and demand that we reinstate funding in some areas, while they are out there in the communities of Scotland calling for less money to be available to the Scottish Government. That is a deeply dishonest position to take. They should at least have a little bit of humility when they come to the chamber and make those demands.</p><p>Faced with the difficult choices that we are forced to take&#8212;it is interesting that those who come to the chamber and say that they want an honest debate about difficult choices are quick to run at the first sight of a debate about difficult choices&#8212;the cabinet secretary is driving forward reform of the college sector. I think that the regional approach will bring great benefits, not just to the sector but to the learners, who of course must be the most important people in this debate. It is worth noting that, even in these difficult times and faced with these difficult decisions, record funding is still being put into student support, which will ensure that students from vulnerable backgrounds can access further education without that being to their detriment. By contrast, in the situation south of the border, fees are crippling some people&#8217;s choices in higher and further education.</p><p>When Neil Bibby was having his little rant about the money that is being taken out of the college sector, I asked him, in the spirit of the honest debate that he claims that he and his party want to have, how he would reduce one budget so that he can consequentially increase another budget. Even though he phoned a friend and Mr Henry was at his ear telling him what answer to give, he could not come up with an answer.</p><p>The reason for that is simple: the answer would compromise another Labour front-bench spokesperson who comes to the Parliament to demand more money for their sector, to appease the people whom they seek to champion. All Labour is doing is deceiving people and leading them up the garden path by suggesting that if the Labour Party had its hands on the levers of power and the finances of the Parliament, there would somehow be an increase in available money and everyone could have more&#8212;</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676797", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Further Education"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The cheek of a Tory to tell us how we should go about rebuilding the Scottish economy.

It also helps to reduce her outgoings because if she was not eligible for the free bus pass, she would have to pay to use the bus and would have to weigh that up in her weekly budget.

I want to explore a number of issues, the first of which is the importance of corporate parenting. Early in my days as a councillor in Aberdeen, it was emphasised to me by my then group leader, one Councillor Kevin Stewart&#8212;whatever happened to him?&#8212;that it was extremely important that we took our roles as corporate parents seriously. It is important that members at all levels take up opportunities for training and involvement in corporate parenting strategies.</p><p>I was often struck by the feeling that council members who were not part of the administration perhaps did not recognise or appreciate their role as corporate parents and felt that the responsibility and burden fell only on councillors who were part of the administration. It is perhaps worth re-emphasising to all local authority members that they have a role as a corporate parent, regardless of whether they are a member of their council&#8217;s administration.</p><p>My colleague Kevin Stewart mentioned the good practice in Aberdeen City Council. When we talk about best practice, it is important that, rather than simply highlight it, we consider ways in which it can be shared with other local authorities. We have heard examples of areas where there might be room for improvement or where local authorities are not delivering what could be described as best practice. When a fostering and adoption service has been nationally recognised, as Aberdeen&#8217;s has, it should be highlighted to those councils as something to consider.</p><p>During my time as a councillor in Aberdeen, investment was made in bringing children&#8217;s homes back up to a standard that allowed the council to bring children back to Aberdeen from out-of-area placements, which were often extremely expensive and counterproductive. Nanette Milne commented that we sometimes have to send children out of the area, and I agree that that will be necessary on occasion but, all too often in Aberdeen, it happened not because it was the best option, but because it was the only option, as the investment to enable placements within the local authority area simply had not been made. However, thanks to investment in, for example, the Willows children&#8217;s home and the Gilbert Road children&#8217;s home in my former council ward, we were able to reverse some of the decisions that had been taken, which had not proven to be the best decisions for the individuals or the local authority.</p><p>We must also look at the wider children&#8217;s home estate and work out which homes are no longer fit for purpose. In Aberdeen, one home in my ward, the Netherhills children&#8217;s home, which was not fit for purpose, was closed. As well as investing, we must consider whether children&#8217;s homes are appropriate.</p><p>Smashing some adoption myths is one of the most powerful things that we can do. It was pleasing to hear the comments from my colleague Joan McAlpine on age, which is often viewed as a barrier to people coming forward to adopt. The most important criterion for people adopting should be the ability to give love and security, and that can be fulfilled no matter what the age of the individual. We must get beyond the stigmatisation that all too often surrounds age. BAAF&#8217;s chief executive, David Holmes, has talked about the need to grapple with myths and to ensure that people do not rule themselves out of adoption, but rather rule themselves in.</p><p>I agree with Margaret McDougall&#8217;s interesting point that we need to consider whether placements with the family are best. That is one reason why the Government&#8217;s work on kinship care, such as the introduction of kinship carer payments and the work to enshrine the role of kinship carers in statute as part of the forthcoming children and young people bill, is extremely important.</p><p>One point that has rung true throughout the debate is about the importance of having children at the centre. I have listened carefully to many members saying that we need to speed up the process. I agree that, in many cases, the process takes far too long, but for me the most important thing is to ensure that we get the process right for the child, rather than simply do it quickly. If we can improve speed and still get it right for the child, that is a winning combination, but we should never sacrifice the rights of the child simply for speed of process. That must be our main focus.</p><p>BAAF&#8217;s national adoption week website has been collecting the wishes of children who want to be adopted. I will take the opportunity to share some of those wishes, which go from the touching to the amusing.</p><p>Phoebe, aged five, says:</p><p>&#8220;I wish for a family that can show me love and patience&#8221;.</p><p>Robbie, aged four, and his brother Simon, aged six, say:</p><p>&#8220;We wish to have a family who will look after us, give us cuddles and have fun with us&#8221;.</p><p>There is also Ellie, aged four, who wishes</p><p>&#8220;for a mummy who will make my hair look nice&#8221;.</p><p>We then have Jack, aged five, who says:</p><p>&#8220;I wish for a monkey, puppies and cats and dogs&#8221;.</p><p>If anybody watching the debate or reading the Official Report has a monkey at home, they could be the person Jack is looking for.</p><p>Lastly, we have Corey, aged seven, who says:</p><p>&#8220;I wish for two dads so I don&#8217;t have to share with my younger brother&#8221;.</p><p>On the days when I have one child in my arms and the other child tugging at me to get my attention, I can sympathise with that sentiment.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-06", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22675932", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Permanence and Adoption"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As a parent of two young children, the welfare of children and young people in Scotland is extremely close to my heart.

Given the many inventions that they patented, that was perhaps a major error on their part.</p><p>Kenneth Gibson talked about Murdoch&#8217;s discovery in 1795 of an alternative to isinglass, which is a substance used in the brewing industry to remove impurities. It is actually obtained, rather tastefully, from the swim bladder of fish. In 1795, when Murdoch made his discovery, isinglass was exclusively produced from sturgeon&#8212;specifically, beluga sturgeon&#8212;which was extremely expensive to import and cost the brewing industry a great deal. Murdoch discovered that it was possible to substitute dried cod for sturgeon, which made the brewing industry a significant saving. Indeed, it was considered such a significant discovery that the Committee of London Brewers paid him &#163;2,000&#8212;which, at that time, was a fairly substantial sum&#8212;to use his invention and end their dependence on imports.</p><p>Members have gone through the list of the various inventions in which Mr Murdoch played a significant part, even if he did not develop them entirely himself. It strikes me as rather odd that, when I went through school, his was not one of the prominent names that were mentioned. I think of a recent episode of &#8220;QI&#8221;, in which Stephen Fry listed all the things that were invented by Scots. The list was extensive, but not necessarily exhaustive, because I am pretty sure that some of the inventions that we have spoken about this evening did not feature in it. Perhaps that highlights the need to make people more aware of individuals such as Murdoch and the significant contributions that they have made to the world.</p><p>I am a representative of the north-east of Scotland.

Those were the results of the review in relation to reducing the limit.</p><p>Like James Dornan, I do not drink&#8212;this feels like some sort of inverse confessional&#8212;but I used to drink. However, I always took the view that if I was driving somewhere, even for a night out, I would not drink a drop of alcohol. I agree strongly with Alex Johnstone that a person can never tell what the impact of a drink will be on them, as it can affect them differently depending on how much sleep they have had and on how much they have had to eat that day. It can have different impacts depending on the circumstances. It is not just about how alcohol affects the individual, but how it can affect them differently on a day-by-day basis. That is why I think that it is far better to err on the side of not drinking than to take the risk.</p><p>I turn to the issue of campaigns and social attitudes. The Lancet has described being arrested for drink-driving in Sweden as</p><p>&#8220;a social and personal catastrophe&#8221;.</p><p>By contrast, the president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, David O&#8217;Connor, has stated that</p><p>&#8220;drink-driving is still seen as socially acceptable in some quarters.&#8221;</p><p>There is, therefore, an attitudinal issue to address. An Ipsos MORI poll on attitudes to the drink-driving limit that I caught sight of today shows that there is strong agreement with the proposal to reduce the drink-driving limit to 50mg. Support for that is strongest in the over-55 age group&#8212;at 73 per cent&#8212;which bears out James Dornan&#8217;s testimony about those who remember the hard-hitting anti-drink-driving campaigns. Interestingly, the poll demonstrates that support for the reduction is weakest in the 18-to-24 age group, which emphasises the need for education. It makes the point that we need to focus on a generation who have missed the hard-hitting messages.</p><p>There have been some welcome campaigns, such as this year&#8217;s mourning after campaign in Grampian, which was launched in June. In May, there were 45 arrests for drink-driving in Grampian, which demonstrates the difficulties that are faced. The mourning after campaign called on members of the public to report drink-drivers.

I think that most people would accept that that was a rather irresponsible thing to do while complaining that councils are not funded properly. If councils are not being funded properly, why was Stirling Council able to cut the council tax?</p><p>It is clear from his speech that my colleague Richard Lyle is gunning for the Mercedes/BMW driver vote. I say to him that, although Mercedes and BMW are German, so, too, is schadenfreude. Perhaps we should encourage drivers of such vehicles to consider measures such as winter tyres, as well as pointing to the difficulties that they can experience in icy conditions.</p><p>The maintenance of our road and footpath networks is an important issue. Aberdeen City Council, as a member of which I served until May of this year, currently has 16,726 tonnes of salt in stock. That compares with a stock of 15,986 tonnes in the previous year. Interestingly, the salt usage in that year was only 8,088 tonnes. That is a significant fall compared to the usage the year before that, perhaps reflecting the milder winter that we had. Nonetheless, that also demonstrates a much better strategy for salt usage by the council than perhaps had been the case in previous years.</p><p>Another issue is whether there are other means by which roads and footpaths can be treated, rather than simply using salt. The council has purchased 24,000 litres of a substance called Eco-Thaw, which it intended to trial in 2011-12. The conditions under which Eco-Thaw is most effective in comparison with salt&#8212;hard-packed snow and ice&#8212;were not prevalent in 2011-12, but Eco-Thaw remains at the council&#8217;s disposal.</p><p>Potholes are an important issue, on main routes and on side roads. I am glad that Alex Johnstone agreed with my earlier comment that it is not always the case that potholes are due to poorly maintained roads. Often utility companies or others dig up roads and do not repair them properly, which leads to gaps in the surface through which water ingress occurs. Ice then forms and we get potholes. We need to look at whether utility companies perhaps bear some of the responsibility on some occasions and whether there should be some discussion around the possibility of their perhaps putting forward some funding towards repair, rather than it simply being the responsibility of local or central Government.</p><p>The other issue that we have to consider is how best to develop community resilience. I speak to a number of elderly residents in the north-east of Scotland and many of them go back to the days when neighbours looked out for one another and when people gritted their own paths and the areas outside their homes. We have gone back from that in a way. I live in a street that will frankly never be top of the priority list for the council, not just because I live on it, but because it is not an access route to anywhere. It is essentially a road where you come in at one end and leave at the other and it does not connect to anything. Therefore, in the past I have gone out and gritted areas on my street when necessary, particularly where there are elderly residents. We should look at encouraging the development of that kind of community resilience and that kind of neighbourly spirit.</p><p>My colleague Graeme Dey mentioned Mike Weir&#8217;s bill. Compared with the frankly archaic, nonsensical system of members&#8217; bills in Westminster, where members have to go through a bizarre, byzantine lottery, our process in the Scottish Parliament much better enables back-bench members to involve themselves.</p><p>I mentioned driver behaviour and the use of winter tyres, but many of us will have noted, particularly as the mornings get darker, that there are many drivers who do not use their headlights when they should. When we get into more severe winter weather, that becomes a significant safety concern. I know that in Scandinavia, for example, there are rules and regulations on the use of headlights. Perhaps we need to reflect on that point, given the weather conditions that we often face in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22674790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Winter Resilience"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Indeed&#8212;like Stirling Labour, which cut the council tax.

Sir Jackie Stewart&#8217;s story has always fascinated me. I have been a formula 1 fan for many years and I remember watching a documentary about Sir Jackie&#8217;s struggle with dyslexia. His tale of his experience at school was quite harrowing, as he was made to feel almost inadequate as a student simply because of his challenges with dyslexia. In an article, he is quoted as saying:</p><p>&#8220;I can still remember every braking distance and gear change I needed to get around the N&#252;rburgring circuit in Germany&#8212;and there were 187 corners when I raced there&#8212;but I can&#8217;t get through my alphabet.&#8221;</p><p>That remarkable quote sets in context the challenge that is often faced by individuals with dyslexia.</p><p>The other point is that Sir Jackie&#8217;s experience demonstrates that there is no limit to what can be achieved by someone with dyslexia.

We set them out to the people in 2011. In many instances, the Labour Party backed us on those priorities either in votes in the chamber or in the priorities in its manifesto.

One would think that if the Labour Party was staying true to the mantra that Johann Lamont espoused, the Labour Party in Aberdeen would have joined in the debate and outlined tough choices. Did it at any stage move an alternative budget from opposition? No. Did it at any stage engage in the discussion around the choices that the council had to make?

I was happy to see Deveron Coaches of Macduff in the north-east of Scotland being one of the beneficiaries of round two of the green bus fund. It received almost &#163;175,000. That is a sign that smaller bus companies and operators are able to access the fund. I am sure that the minister will join me in encouraging other bus operators, of whatever size, to access the fund to assist their business in the future.</p><p>The green bus fund has another role to play as part of a wider effort to shift attitudes in society. I congratulate Jim Hume on revealing his purchase of a hybrid car. I note that he made it quite clear that he has not bought a hybrid bus and I understand that the reason for that is that, these days, the Lib Dems need only a car for their day trips. I will leave that to one side and say that Jim Hume deserves credit for taking that step.</p><p>The Government is putting up money through the green bus fund, but we also need to encourage private enterprise to look at what it can do with, for example, car manufacturers. Alex Johnstone made that point when he talked about what private businesses could do to drive down costs to ensure that we get a bigger bang for our buck.</p><p>Other areas of the transport network could look at the technologies that are being implemented and see whether they can play a role. Government money is finite and we are living in difficult economic times, so it would be unrealistic to assume that the Government can throw vast sums of money at every area of the transport network to develop technologies. That is an opportunity to say that this is the direction of travel&#8212;for want of a better pun&#8212;and that we want other sectors of the transport network to look at whether they can play a role in reducing emissions in the future.</p><p>I am sorry to say that I do not think that I will support the Labour amendment at decision time. Labour members do not seem to understand how a debate works. They keep calling for an honest debate, but for a debate to occur, there need to be two distinct positions. The Government is laying out its policy agenda and priorities as part of the budget. If the Labour Party wants to disagree with those, that is fine, but it needs to say what it would do differently and how it would do it. It is not enough for the Labour Party to say that it wants the Government to address the cut to BSOG and then, when it is asked what we should do in order to fund that, to say that it is not going to make up policy on the hoof. That is not an honest position. The Labour Party must come to the chamber and outline an alternative direction. If the Labour Party wants to have an honest debate, let us have it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the green bus fund that the Government announced in its recent budget.

I make him look quick, so that must be where the comment came from.</p><p>The Olympics and Paralympics over the summer made me cast my mind back to when I was an active member of Aberdeen Amateur Athletics Club, which was a good few years and a good few stones ago.

Elite athletes do not just happen; they often get their start in sport in community clubs, with the coaching and encouragement that they get at that level.

I was lucky in that Dyce Boys Club was proactive about putting coaches forward for coaching badges as well as first aid courses, so that coaches could react if there was a significant injury and a player needed assistance on the pitch. That does not happen at every club, and often there is no such support network.

The first example harks back to my maiden speech in this chamber, in which I highlighted the work of the Udny community wind turbine. It was established as a result of the community council deciding that it wanted to develop a local wind turbine and fund local projects with the money that was generated from selling the electricity to the national grid. The council projected that, over a 20 year period, as much as &#163;4&#160;million to &#163;5&#160;million could be raised for that small community, which comprises only a couple of villages in Aberdeenshire. I had the pleasure of visiting the turbine after it had been officially switched on.</p><p>The Udny community wind turbine went on to be awarded the community initiative award at last year&#8217;s Scottish green energy awards. It is a fantastic example of the kind of community renewable initiative to which the minister referred in his opening speech and it sets a strong example of what can be achieved by communities coming together, recognising a strong project and working to deliver it. Those things could be strengthened by some aspects that could be introduced to the bill.</p><p>I also want to touch on leased community centres. In Aberdeen, where I had the pleasure of serving as a local councillor, a number of community centres are already leased and more will become leased. I want to highlight the Inchgarth community centre, which I have experience of from my time working for Maureen Watt and from standing for election to another Parliament as a candidate for Aberdeen South.</p><p>Inchgarth is a leased community centre that is run by and for the community, and it is popular and vibrant. A tea room has recently been added to it, which is doing a roaring trade. One of the centre&#8217;s volunteers, 17-year-old Ruairidh Morrison, was recently awarded the young volunteer award at the Aberdeen impact awards, which are run by the Aberdeen Council for Voluntary Organisations. The centre&#8217;s chairman, Paul O&#8217;Connor, was recently awarded an MBE for his work in the community. The centre runs a range of different classes and projects that are tailored to deliver on the community&#8217;s behalf and which are proving extremely popular.</p><p>In such operations, communities can take ownership of the programme and what is delivered. Communities are often much more aware of what the community is looking for than council officials are, in terms of the programme that they would deliver.</p><p>Margo MacDonald rose&#8212;</p><p>I see that Margo MacDonald wishes to intervene.

The issue is how we ensure that people are involved or willing to get involved in their communities. I think that Margo MacDonald&#8217;s point, which I take, was about capacity building. Councils need to build capacity in communities.</p><p>The one note of caution that I strike in relation to the leased community centres is that Aberdeen City Council has sent letters to centres that suggest that if they do not sign up to new lease agreements, which are currently being negotiated, they will be evicted by the end of November. It is unfortunate that the council sent such letters before the negotiation process reached its natural conclusion.</p><p>There is an extremely good community garden in Dyce&#8212;the village where I live and which I represented on the local council.

I am still keen to drive forward the project, which will bring together the community, the council and other interested stakeholders.</p><p>In Dyce, the community council received a generous grant to upgrade the path network in Central park, and was fortunate enough to have money left over from the project, which it sought to spend wisely. It spotted a play area that had fallen into significant disrepair, and by using the talents of its members and the community planning officer, and after seeking the community&#8217;s views, it was able to develop the play area so that what had been fairly ramshackle and disused is now probably extremely vibrant and well used.</p><p>As that example demonstrates, councils sometimes hold assets that they do not regard as a priority for upgrading, because of budgetary constraints and so on, which local communities can develop if they are given the opportunity and the resources to do so. I hope that the minister will take such examples on board. I will be happy to share more information with him if he wants me to do so, to inform how he shapes the bill. There are good examples of how the bill can work, and I will be excited to see how the bill develops, because it has exciting potential for Scotland&#8217;s communities.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22672143", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It began very much with a group of committed individuals who used the centre and saw the potential to do more with it.

First, it attacked the general concept of what was proposed, despite the fact that, as my colleague Brian Adam so eloquently described, it had been proposed by Labour councillors in the past. Indeed, Len Ironside, who is convener of social work on the council, proposed a millennium square during his time as council leader, which would have had a similar effect of covering over the Denburn and raising Union Terrace gardens to street level.</p><p>Labour then attacked the aesthetics by talking about the design and how unattractive it was. Both of those arguments were resoundingly defeated by the referendum result, so Labour moved them to the side and started to attack the funding model. That is where it put most of its ammunition between the referendum result and the decision in August.</p><p>Labour is now saying that we should give the council TIF, which it attacked so vehemently, for as yet unspecified, uncosted projects.

It is unfortunate that the better together parties are trying to criticise a substantial legislative agenda. For example, Johann Lamont rather pooh-poohed the better regulation bill when she suggested that nobody would look back and welcome it in 50 years&#8217; time.

If they have their way, that will continue to be the situation&#8212;the Parliament will continue to have to hold out its hands and say to Westminster, &#8220;Please, sir, I would like some more.&#8221; We want this Parliament and this nation to control their own destiny and to shape their own future by taking control of powers over capital expenditure and borrowing, of the levers of the economy and of welfare and pensions&#8212;things that matter greatly to the people whom Ken Macintosh and I represent and which are currently not in the Parliament&#8217;s competence.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22671349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government&#8217;s Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Drew Smith&#8217;s comment kind of made the point that I will make.

Most of my colleagues have covered the notion that the changes will affect not just people who are not in work, but even in relation to people who are not in work, perhaps he should consider talking to his Conservative colleagues in London and getting them to put capital investment into the shovel-ready projects that would help to stimulate the economy and create the jobs that are not available. To be frank, strangling our nation&#8217;s economic growth while widening the holes in the safety net into which people are expected to fall is nothing short of abhorrent.</p><p>I direct Mr Johnstone to the comments of 17-year-old Dylan Munro in tonight&#8217;s Evening Express about the impact that the Cameron proposals on housing benefit for the under-25s would have on him. He has been through an employment programme at Station House Media Unit. He states clearly that if he lost his housing subsidy, which helps him as a minimum-wage earner, he would become homeless. That is not the kind of future to which we should aspire for young Scots such as Dylan Munro.</p><p>The housing benefit changes in relation to occupancy will have a massive impact on local authorities and housing associations. As a Finance Committee member, I have heard evidence to that effect from local authorities and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. The changes fly in the face of housing policy, because they anticipate that we will somehow start throwing up one-bedroom properties again, when the drive must be to provide more family-sized accommodation. They also take no consideration of individuals who might be separated and who might require additional bedrooms for children who visit them at weekends or for other periods, for example. A ridiculous approach is being taken.</p><p>We hear about the notion of &#163;2.2 billion a year; would that we were not spending &#163;3.5 billion a year on a Trident replacement&#8212;I am sure that the people of Scotland would be more than happy to see the back of that in order to help the most vulnerable.</p><p>We in the Parliament are dealing with mitigation; that is all that we can do. At the Finance Committee&#8217;s meeting on Tuesday, John Swinney said that he could not say that he could protect everyone from the impacts of welfare reform. Given the Parliament&#8217;s fixed budget, it would be wrong of us to claim that we can protect everyone. Protecting everybody from the impacts of the welfare reform changes at Westminster simply will not be possible.</p><p>If the route that David Cameron has described is followed, while the UK Government continues to attack this Parliament&#8217;s budgets, the situation will become even more difficult for us to deal with. It is not credible for anyone to look at the wrecking ball that is being taken to the welfare state and claim with any sincerity that a progressive, open and socially just future for Scotland is better served by remaining part of the UK. I heard talk about Scotland as an independent country being an uncertain future for our people. Frankly, I agree with Ian Bell of The Herald, who said clearly that the future is an uncertain place, but it is far more uncertain for our people as part of the United Kingdom than it is as an independent Scotland.</p><p>Presiding Officer, the mace that sits in front of you is inscribed with the values that this Parliament and this nation hold true. One of those is compassion, and I see precious little compassion in the Con-Dem welfare reforms that are currently taking place or in those that are being mooted by David Cameron for the future.

I know that her original intention was to have a members&#8217; business debate on the motion, but the seriousness of the issue is such that it is appropriate that it has been chosen for Conservative Party business. I am pleased, given that there appears to be consensus, that we are able to unite around the motion and amendments.</p><p>I met Sheila McKay of the Grampian Family Support Forum not long after I was elected, at the community partnerships programme event that was held in the Parliament. As Nanette Milne did, I attended the recovery happens event in the Parliament. It is fair to say that one would need to have had a heart of stone not to be moved by the testimonies of the individuals who spoke at that meeting. The clear message came out that families have a key role and that they want it to be further embedded.</p><p>There were three main messages from the event. First, families have a lot to contribute and want to be involved in supporting the people whom they love, and in helping to find solutions to the wider problems. Secondly, people who are recovering from addiction want to give something back. Thirdly, we as a Parliament and as a society, need to work together to help to tackle the stigma that people with addictions and their families face.</p><p>Important work is being done by networks such as the Grampian Family Support Forum and the other forums that have been mentioned and which will, I am sure, continue to be mentioned by members. The key role that they play is to ensure that families that are affected by substance misuse do not feel isolated within their communities. One thing that was highlighted at the recovery happens event&#8212;Nanette Milne mentioned it in her speech&#8212;is that, whether we like it or not, a societal stigma remains around substance misuse, and especially around families in which a member has a substance misuse problem. Stigma is felt by those families when, instead of taking what might be seen as the easy option and casting the family member away, they choose to support and help them. As Nanette Milne said, one aspect of that stigma is the language that is used in society.</p><p>At the recovery happens event, I made the point that we politicians have a key role to play in shaping the public debate about substance misuse and how individuals and families who are affected by it are viewed through the prism of the public debate. We must all take caution and reflect on how we respond to calls from journalists to comment on issues relating to substance misuse, particularly where an individual has committed an offence that relates to their substance misuse. The language that is used often stigmatises the family of the individual, which adds to the isolation that they feel&#8212;isolation that is being tackled by groups such as the Grampian Family Support Forum.</p><p>We also need to reflect on our own situations, which I certainly did during the recovery happens event. Within my community, my peer group and the people I went to school with, there are those who have gone down the road of substance misuse, and I reflected on the different ways in which our lives have gone. Some of the people whom I played with in the playground at primary school now find themselves involved in substance misuse. We must recognise that substance misuse is not the preserve of certain communities in society. It happens to people who have the same life chances as those who go on to very different outcomes and destinations. It can happen to anyone, and it can affect anyone. We need to reflect on that when we look at how we shape the debate going forward.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669756", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Families"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate Nanette Milne on bringing this important debate to the chamber.

Therein lies a conflict. The aggressive lobbying of arms companies often leads countries into a conflict situation. There are nations out there that have questionable foreign and domestic policies, and we cannot necessarily rely on those nations always to act in the best possible way in relation to the arms trade.</p><p>I am keen to see an arms trade treaty because I would like to see the prevention of human rights abuses. We have discussed how the countries that were involved in the Arab spring saw the state using weapons against peaceful protesters. Under an arms trade treaty, such states would not be able to import arms and other nations would not be able to continue to trade arms with them, as Russia does with Syria. There is no indication that Russia has changed its policy on the arms trade treaty and, indeed, it is one of the nations that is backing it, but Russia would be in breach of such a treaty if it continued to supply Syria with weapons, as it is doing.</p><p>Embargoes are ineffective. Oxfam has estimated that &#163;2.2 billion of arms were imported by countries that were under embargoes. As countries are necessarily forewarned of an embargo, one often sees a spike in arms trading in advance of an embargo coming into force, as happened in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, for example. Embargoes are also ambiguous. Huge loopholes give arms dealers the opportunity to claim that they are unaware of the fact that the nations with which they are trading will use those weapons against their civilian population, as is the case in Syria and was the case in Libya, despite the fact that there is plenty of documented evidence to suggest the contrary.</p><p>A key consideration for companies and countries is that they will have to start to think in the long term when it comes to the trading of arms. They need to think about who they are trading with and where those arms might end up. They need to think about the security situation of their trading partner and who else their trading partner does business with.</p><p>The arms trade treaty is an important treaty that needs to be passed.

I have less than six minutes and I have a few points that I want to make.</p><p>The Finance Committee has been taking evidence on employability. We were grateful to the minister for coming before the committee yesterday in its final evidence session. I raised a number of points during that session, although some would say that it was more banging a drum than raising a point. I want to put on record some of my thoughts on the work that might be done on the subjects of stigmatisation and role models.</p><p>An area that I have been keen to explore&#8212;it was raised by Who Cares? Scotland at the Finance Committee&#8212;is looked-after children, and how we deal with people who are leaving care, given the current economic situation in which job opportunities are not always available. For whatever reason, a stigma is attached to people who have left a care setting when they apply for a job, particularly if they are up against four or five individuals who do not have that background. We must do all that we can to break that stigma.</p><p>One way to do that is to have local authorities using their corporate parenting role positively. As parents, we aspire to give our children the best opportunities and, if we operated a family firm, we would try to find opportunities in that firm for our children, if possible. Local authorities should consider this from a corporate parenting perspective. I commend the work that has been done by Aberdeen City Council in offering work experience placements to looked-after children within the council organisation, and I hope that other local authorities might consider doing likewise.</p><p>Beyond that, we need to consider whether there are opportunities to use role models&#8212;people who have left a care setting and are in the world of work. They do not have to be high fliers but can be people who hold down a steady job and who can share their experiences and act as mentors and role models, if they wish to do so. That is something that we also need to look at positively.</p><p>Another area of stigmatisation is the mentality that we have had for too long in Scotland that certain jobs are undesirable. They become categorised as those jobs that people will end up doing if they do not stick in at school. We need to break that cycle and stigma, and use positive role models to do that. At one of the Finance Committee meetings, representatives of Asda told us that their chief executive started in the company as a shelf stacker with one O level. That is the kind of person we need to have operating as a positive role model to show people that, although they should aspire to leave school with academic qualifications, it should not be seen as the end of the world if they do not achieve that outcome.</p><p>The minister spoke about the stigmatisation of young people in the difficult views that businesses sometimes have. That came across in the written evidence to the committee from GTG Training, and it was disappointing that it was not able to attend the committee to be questioned about the evidence that it gave about the employability of young people. When businesses identify young people they feel are not ready for employment, they absolutely must signpost them to where they can receive training and support to make them more employable. If they do not do that, those young people will just become caught in some kind of ridiculous merry-go-round or pass-the-parcel from employer to employer. They might not be able to access the workforce but neither can they access the assistance that is required to give them the necessary skills to get them into the workforce.</p><p>The minister spoke about meaningful work experience and engagement with employers. I commend the work that is being done by the schools careers industry partnership in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. An article appeared on the STV Aberdeen website yesterday that said that hundreds of youngsters are set to benefit from a training programme that will help school leavers to find work. The scheme is partially funded by local authorities and through sponsorship from the oil and gas and subsea sectors. It seeks to provide young people with skills, training and assistance to get the skills that they will require to enter the world of work when they leave school. Alastair Fraser, the director of Coaching Training Consultancy, said of GTG Training:</p><p>&#8220;Essentially they were saying that youngsters aren&#8217;t used to work or fit to work. Our experience in working with more than 800 young people is that they need help and support to sell themselves well.&#8221;</p><p>The work that is being done by the schools careers industry partnership in the north-east should be looked at and replicated elsewhere. We owe it to ourselves to help our young people in every way possible.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669538", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Employment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "No, thank you.

I encountered Mr Morris in the north-east of Scotland, and I was struck by some his testimony as a witness and, by extension, as a victim of the process. I note that one of the Government&#8217;s proposed key principles is that</p><p>&#8220;Victims and witnesses should have access to appropriately tailored support before, during and after proceedings.&#8221;</p><p>I want to focus much of what I have to say on that because it relates to the matter that Mr Morris was obviously campaigning on. As Lewis Macdonald rightly highlighted, Mr Morris&#8217;s sister Claire was murdered in 1994, although the trial was not brought until some 17 years later when new evidence came to light.</p><p>I first encountered Mr Morris was when he was trying to reclaim his sister&#8217;s grave, and it is worth putting on record the excellent work of the Aberdeen Law Project, which is a student-led clinic that did a huge amount of work to assist Mr Morris in that endeavour.</p><p>Mr Morris petitioned the Parliament on victims of crime. His view was very much that, although the perpetrators of crime are delivered sentences, there is also often a silent sentence that is served on those who are the victims of crime and, by extension, on their families.</p><p>Mr Morris undertook a walk to Parliament, which unfortunately had a personal cost for him because he was forced to have one of his legs amputated below the knee after it became infected. However, I walked the first 10 miles of that walk with Mr Morris from his sister&#8217;s graveside to the village of Newburgh in Aberdeenshire. On the way, we discussed the issues that he was trying to raise. One of the things that he felt was difficult was that there can be gaps in support for victims because of compartmentalisation of the justice process, in that each component of the justice system has its own role. Victims often feel, therefore, that they are being passed like a parcel from organisation to organisation as each organisation&#8217;s role closes and another&#8217;s begins.</p>", "hdate": "2012-06-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22669076", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses (Improving Services)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "On Annabel Goldie&#8217;s comment, my understanding of &#8220;Strike it Lucky&#8221; is that participants had to avoid hitting hot spots.

It is an opportunity to radically reform fisheries management in Europe that must not be squandered. There is a great opportunity to act on discards and decentralisation, which most of us in the chamber will welcome. However, the key message is that things such as the move towards decentralisation can and should go further. I know that Scottish National Party MEPs will push for that in the European Parliament and I hope that they will be able to rely on support from colleagues in other parties in this chamber and support from other member states across Europe. Those moves must be advanced to make fisheries management tangible and beneficial to fishing communities. For too long, the top-down, centralised structure of the CFP has strangled our fishing communities. Unfortunately, many of them have failed to recover. There is still hope, however, that a radical reform in that direction can inject a bit of life back into those areas.</p><p>As well as opportunities, there are threats, two of which come from attempts to introduce mandatory elements through amendments to the CFP. Mandatory TFCs are a threat to Scotland&#8217;s historic rights and they entirely misunderstand and undermine the concept of regionalising fisheries management. The notion of centralising mandatory requirements at the same time as regionalising fisheries management is counterintuitive.</p><p>Similarly, the proposed fish stock recovery areas also seem ill thought out and tacked on, and they must be resisted at every opportunity. That is not to say that stock recovery is not important, or that efforts should not be made to conserve fish stock. Opposing that measure does not send out that message&#8212;rather, it clearly says that to arbitrarily set aside anywhere between 10 and 20 per cent of waters for mandatory fish stock recovery totally misunderstands and undermines the ability of nations to best manage their waters and regionally manage their fisheries. That has to be opposed. I know that the SNP will strongly oppose it in the European Parliament and I hope that SNP members can rely on support from the other parties represented in this chamber and from other parties across Europe.</p><p>This is a moment of opportunity. It is a chance for Europe to right some of the wrongs that have been done to our fishing communities over time.

They included a number of individuals from my region of North East Scotland, again from a diverse range of backgrounds. From the business community, there was Stewart Spence, the owner of the Marcliffe hotel in Aberdeen, and Richard Tinto, the managing director of Tinto Architecture in Aberdeen. Both those successful businessmen from the north-east said that they believe that Scotland&#8217;s future is best as an independent country.</p><p>From the faith and community activist area, there was Abdul Latif, a highly respected member of the Muslim community in the north-east and the Aberdeen mosque, saying that he believes that Scotland&#8217;s future is best as an independent country.</p><p>From a military background, there was Andy Brown, a war veteran and the president of Aboyne Royal British Legion, saying that he feels that Scotland&#8217;s future is best as an independent country. When I saw Andy Brown sign the declaration, it brought to mind my grandfather, a veteran of world war two, who fought with the Gordon Highlanders during the campaign in Burma. For those who will read this Official Report and who may not be familiar with them, the Gordon Highlanders were the regiment that was scrapped by the Conservatives. That decision destroyed some of the fine traditions of that regiment. The Labour Government carried through that policy by destroying other regiments, and that will potentially be carried further by Philip Hammond. Successive United Kingdom Governments have shown a disgraceful disregard for Scottish military history.</p><p>Although my grandfather was a veteran of the British campaign in world war two, he was also a believer in Scottish independence. Not because he was ashamed, embarrassed or opposed to what had happened in his past, but because he recognised that what had happened in terms of a shared campaign and history could be celebrated as an independent country, and, furthermore, that nations would continue to co-operate in the best interests of the international community as independent, mature nations. That was his firm belief and one of the reasons why he supported independence. I am sure that that is a reason why Andy Brown, too, supports independence, as do a range of other individuals from military backgrounds who have either signed the declaration or stated their support for independence.</p><p>Sadly, my grandfather passed away in 2010. He did not live to see me being elected to the Parliament, nor to see the start of the yes campaign, but I know that he would be happy that that campaign has started, and with the range of people who are backing it.</p><p>I became a father in 2008 and my second child arrived in 2011. The arrival of my children has strengthened my belief that we need independence because I want to build a better Scotland, not only for everybody else&#8217;s children but for my own. I look at them and the future that lies ahead of them. I look at what the UK Government is doing in so many areas, such as welfare and disabilities, and that makes me anxious and worried for my children&#8217;s future.</p><p>An independent Scotland could build a more socially just nation for our children. That is why people who firmly believe in social justice, such as Dennis Canavan, are backing independence. They recognise that a socially just future is far more possible in an independent Scotland than if we remain anchored to the United Kingdom and the cuts that are being imposed on us.</p><p>I listened to the Labour Party when we debated the concept of welfare cuts being undertaken. They said that it was okay, and that if it came back to power, everything would be all right&#8212;just as it was in 1997 when one of the first acts of the Labour Government was to slash disability benefits. That is what social justice means to the Labour Party at UK level. I firmly believe that there are members on the Labour benches who are committed campaigners for social justice, but they must recognise that remaining a part of the United Kingdom dilutes rather than enhances that opportunity.</p><p>There are many successful, small nations across our planet, and it does not behove the anti-independence parties to throw insults about the arc of insolvency, or to laugh at and deride the trials and tribulations that some of our neighbours, including Ireland and Iceland, have gone through. Those small, independent nations have encountered difficulties, but they do so and continue to do so, and come through them, as small, independent nations. They weather the storms as independent nations&#8212;yes, as part of the international community, and often co-operating together in a range of ways, but they remain true to their state as independent nations. We can quite clearly see that the figures demonstrate that the small, independent nations are recovering at a much greater rate than the large, lumbering beast that is the United Kingdom.</p><p>We are clear on the SNP benches that Scotland&#8217;s future is best served when it is held in Scotland&#8217;s hands.

She speaks with great authority on the issue. I have had many discussions with her about sport, on Twitter and in private.</p><p>Patricia Ferguson made the interesting point that we walked 63 miles a year less in 2003 than we did in 1975. I did a quick calculation and I am pretty sure that I made that difference up during the recent local election campaign but, leaving that aside, it is a worrying statistic that, as a nation, we are walking a great deal less.</p><p>I am aware that I am probably in no position to lecture people on physical activity, although I made my long-awaited five-a-side football comeback at the weekend&#8212;we shall speak no more of that.</p><p>I speak as somebody who, as a teenager and as a young person, was very active. I competed for my local athletics club and have district and national medals at home. However, like many, I stopped exercising in my late teens and that, combined with both a poor diet and what we shall euphemistically refer to as the student lifestyle, sent my weight spiralling upwards. It has been a struggle to reverse that ever since. Those who follow me on Twitter will know that I have chronicled that as Mark versus the flab. Nonetheless, my experience emphasises that although physical activity in our younger years is good, it has to be sustained, because stopping at any point can send someone into a period of reversal, which undoes all the good and can still lead to problems in later life.</p><p>I was also interested in Patricia Ferguson&#8217;s point about children queueing at fast food outlets and, in my intervention, I raised a point about the policy decisions that some local authorities have taken in relation to licensing applications for hot food stands, mobile hot food units or hot food establishments within a certain proximity of a secondary school. I absolutely take on board the point that Patricia Ferguson made in her response to me, which was about ensuring that we provide nutritious and appetising food in our schools to encourage pupils to stay and eat there.</p><p>There is one area where I have personal difficulties in that regard. My former school, Dyce Academy, which is in the area that I represented on the council and now represent as an MSP, is situated right next door to an Asda supermarket. For as long as I can remember, there have been queues of schoolchildren going into the store either to buy chips and pies from the hot food takeaway, or going into the store itself and buying less healthy products because they are available there. At the end of the day, the store probably has its profit margin in mind, and there is no doubt that the profits are heavily boosted by young people going in and purchasing such food, but when they can control what is being sold to young people, they should reflect on that and on the role that they can play in encouraging the young people who go into their stores for their lunch to make healthy choices.</p><p>Prior to entering the Parliament, I was involved in the coaching of youth football. We can all see the benefits of grassroots sporting activity and what it can deliver. It is important that our society does all that it can to nurture and develop grassroots sporting clubs across the range of sporting activities. As well as the two hours of PE that has been spoken about in today&#8217;s debate, we need to focus attention on extra-curricular sporting activity. In many schools, that very much depends on having a willing teacher who is able to give up their time to provide that activity. At my school, one teacher in particular gave up a huge amount of his time to run the school basketball team. He is still at the school and still running that team, to the best of my knowledge. Once that teacher retires, will someone else take on the running of the school basketball team? That is an issue that we need to reflect on.</p><p>The work that is being done to develop the Commonwealth games legacy and cashback for communities is having a positive impact on developing and nurturing grassroots sporting activity, and the Government is to be commended for its actions.</p><p>Nanette Milne spoke about the Aberdeen sports village. One of the things that I was most pleased to be able to do as part of Aberdeen City Council was to push through the new 50m pool that is being developed in Aberdeen. Again, that will massively benefit my and Nanette Milne&#8217;s constituents in the Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire areas by giving them access to such high quality facilities in the north-east of Scotland.</p><p>I agree that we are talking about not just sport, but getting people to be more active in general. Walking instead of using the car is something that we can all do that can have a big impact. We should all aspire to a more active nation, and as members of the Parliament we should do all that we can to lead by example. Society will, undoubtedly, reap the benefits as a result.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22667320", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Physical Activity"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thoroughly enjoyed Alison Johnstone&#8217;s speech and I am happy that we will back her amendment at decision time.

My brother had a not dissimilar reaction to that of Dennis Robertson when he found out that his wife was expecting twins.</p><p>I will cover three areas: postnatal depression; paternity leave, which I raised in my intervention; and play. On postnatal depression, during a Finance Committee discussion on family-nurse partnerships, the issue of the psychological impact on the child of a parent with postnatal depression was highlighted. That is why it is key that we consider how to ensure early diagnosis of postnatal depression. A suggestion that I throw forward is that the minister could speak to her colleagues in the Government about whether, at the six-week postpartum check-up that every woman has, women could be asked to complete the Edinburgh scale test, which detects postnatal depression. That might help with early diagnosis of the condition, which can often be missed, and would prevent women from developing more severe postnatal depression further down the line.</p><p>Another issue that we perhaps need to look at is how we develop and nurture support groups for women with postnatal depression, both support groups that are co-ordinated by local authorities or health boards and ones that come together organically when they are formed by women in communities who know each other and know that they are suffering from postnatal depression. How can we support those groups to ensure that they develop and help those women? Organisations such as Home-Start Aberdeen, which recruits and trains volunteers to visit families at home and offer them informal, friendly and confidential support, have a vital role to play in signposting and in helping to identify people.</p><p>I touched on paternity leave in my intervention on the minister. As I have been through the process myself, what I am saying might sound a bit selfish. As a local authority councillor, I was in the fortunate position that I could work more from home, which meant that I got a bit more time with my children, but often that is not possible and the father has only a fleeting two weeks with the child.</p><p>Paternity leave does not take into account the fact that the woman might have complications. For example, if the mother has had a C-section, she has six weeks when she cannot drive and is not allowed to do any heavy lifting. If she has older children who are perhaps four or five years old, it can be a real difficulty if she is not allowed to lift them to any great degree or carry them and is unable to go out and do the shopping. Consideration must be given to those issues. I acknowledge that the matter is not within the remit of the Scottish Government, but I hope that the minister might factor those issues into her considerations and the discussions that she might have with her UK counterparts.</p><p>I believe that play is vital in developing children&#8217;s social skills and more needs to be done to increase opportunities for play. I welcome the funding that the Scottish Government has allocated in that regard. Local organisations in my area, such as Aberdeen Play Forum, are doing a lot of work to try to increase opportunities for play by working with a range of organisations.</p><p>We must also include reading within play. I always remember the quote attributed to Albert Einstein:</p><p>&#8220;If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.&#8221;</p><p>Initiatives such as bookbug, which is run by the Scottish Book Trust, are vital. Although we focus on a wide range of areas, the most important advice that we can give to parents is this: play with your children and read them bedtime stories.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666854", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Parenting Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As another father of a daughter, and of a son, I recognise much of what my colleague Dennis Robertson said.

There are a number of other local successes across the north-east. The Rowett institute of nutrition and health has been given &#163;10 million of funding for health-related research. Dundee has been named a hub for the rapidly developing renewables sector. Investment of &#163;20 million is being made in life sciences companies, including investment to help Antoxis in Aberdeen with its research in the fight against Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p><p>There are high-quality food and drink products across the Aberdeen area, including those from Brewdog, the independent brewer in Fraserburgh, which makes 80 per cent of its turnover from overseas sales, as was highlighted to us at the Finance Committee just yesterday morning.

The Banffshire Coast Tourism Partnership will also look to attract people to the area.

Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont calls us a powerhouse of the Scottish economy, but her party seems unwilling to push it forward ... The transformational City Garden Project would have helped put a heartbeat into an under-utilised and disconnected city centre.</p><p>But despite far more people voting in favour of it than voted in favour of the new administration&#8217;s parties, its very future now looks in doubt ... It is to be hoped that it can be salvaged and other key developments pushed forward by this new administration. Otherwise, the city and its people will not be known as Ms Lamont&#8217;s &#8216;economic powerhouse&#8217; but an area that continues to enjoy the trappings of individual wealth, but has very little to show for it.&#8221;</p><p>Tom Smith, to whom I referred earlier, has said:</p><p>&#8220;we do have concerns that Labour are opposed to some of the projects and initiatives ACSEF supports to drive growth in the economy and create jobs ... it is hard to believe that a political party are prepared to go against a project which secured a majority vote in a referendum.

I implore the new administration in Aberdeen to think long and hard about the potentially serious and damaging consequences of cancelling some of the infrastructure projects that are vital to the future economic growth of the north-east and of the Scottish nation as a whole.</p><p>Mr Macintosh talked about the small business bonus scheme. When the Federation of Small Businesses says that that has been a lifeline, it means that if it was not in place, small businesses would have gone out of business. That would have meant less economic activity and more people unemployed. Mr Macintosh might wish to cast aspersions on the scheme, which has benefited 85,000 businesses across Scotland, but I suggest that what the FSB says demonstrates clearly that if the scheme was not in place, the small business landscape in Scotland would be in a very different place, which I would not want us to visit.

Ken Macintosh asked why on earth we are listening to Moody&#8217;s and Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s and getting so obsessed by credit ratings, but she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m obsessed by the credit rating for an independent Scotland and I want the question answered.&#8221; The Labour Party might want to do some work on joined-up thinking when it has its next away day. That might help the party with its narrative in the Parliament.</p><p>Given Mary Fee&#8217;s sustained invective against the Conservatives, I am sure that she will be the first to welcome the many council coalitions that Labour is striking with the Conservatives across Scotland. She will be more than happy with that, given what she has had to say about the Conservative Party today.</p><p>On the independence debate being bad for the economy, I accept that perhaps Ms Fee could not watch the Finance Committee meeting this morning, but Lloyds Banking Group&#8217;s top Scottish executive, Philip Grant, said not only in that meeting but in The Scotsman that the independence debate is benefiting Scotland by giving us an increased international profile, making us a talking point across the world&#8212;including in boardrooms across the world&#8212;and attracting potential investment to Scotland. Perhaps that counters the relentless negativity that we have heard from Labour members.</p><p>I want to focus on a couple of areas that the committee looked at. The thread of the demographic change that lies ahead&#8212;particularly the ageing population&#8212;has run through all the speeches that have been made thus far. I agree that we should not look at demographic change as a negative in and of itself. Our elderly population still have a great deal to give society&#8212;through the provision of grandparental care, for example, which is one of the functions that those who have retired often perform, allowing working parents to get back into work and stimulate the economy.</p><p>The points that Gavin Brown and Paul Wheelhouse have made do not necessarily act against each other. Gavin Brown was quite right: people in their mid to late 60s are much more active than such people were in previous years. However, Paul Wheelhouse identified that, because we are living longer, the likelihood&#8212;or potential&#8212;of our having serious health complications obviously increases. I stand here as a shining example of Scotland&#8217;s bad diet. We have particular problems with diet and lack of activity, and we need to consider them. People might live an extra 20 or 30 years, but that does not necessarily mean that problems will not arise as a result.</p><p>During the round-table discussion on demographic change, I raised the issue of migration and the need to attract skilled working-age migrants to Scotland. There is a real clash in that area between the policies that are being pursued at the UK level and the need to develop Scotland-specific solutions. I think that both Professor Jeffery and George MacKenzie of the National Records of Scotland, who produced a table that looked at the prospects if we have low net migration and an ageing population, agreed with that point. We have to focus on how we can engender a culture change within the UK Border Agency so that it can see the need for a particular set of solutions for Scotland in the short term&#8212;until, of course, we control our own migration policy, when we can develop solutions for ourselves.</p><p>On universal services, there is often an obsession with popular policies, such as those relating to bus passes, free prescriptions and the council tax freeze. We are always told that we cannot afford such policies, but members should look at how much we spend on those individual policies in the context of the global budget. A huge proportion of the global budget is not being spent on those policies. Some people have the mindset that somehow in difficult times, Governments should not do popular things. The UK coalition Government might be pursuing that policy&#8212;if it is, it is doing so very successfully&#8212;but the Scottish Government is quite right to stick to its guns and say that universal services policies are not just popular but have wider social benefits, which Margaret Burgess specifically highlighted.</p><p>A lot of work still needs to be done: for example, to change attitudes across Scotland, particularly in relation to deprivation and how we target particular services and funding towards areas of deprivation. If tackling deprivation was easy, we would have done it by now&#8212;and we would have done so much better in the good times. We are now in very difficult economic circumstances, but that does not mean that we should not strive to effect change in our most deprived areas to ensure that children who are born in those communities do not find that, essentially, they have been born to fail.

I am a little bit younger than George Adam, so I do not recall those instances. What brought the condition to my attention was Brian Irvine, the Aberdeen footballer, announcing that he was suffering from MS. &#8220;Suffering&#8221; was the term that he used at the time; I know that we try not to use that term, but as Margaret Burgess has identified, many people who have MS tell you directly that it is a condition that leads to varying degrees of suffering for them, on occasions.</p><p>On Monday, I was delighted to visit the Aberdeen branch of the MS Society, which operates from the Stuart resource centre in Mastrick. I also visited the stall that the society&#8217;s Inverurie branch is running in the Bon Accord centre all this week. The Stuart resource centre is unique in being a dedicated centre for the MS Society&#8217;s use. A range of activities are provided there, from gentle exercise to Thursday afternoon Scrabble and dominoes sessions, which give members an opportunity to interact and engage.</p><p>At the Stuart resource centre, I spoke to a number of branch members. They raised a few concerns with me, which I will take the opportunity to highlight. One concern, which a number of members have highlighted, is about not just the benefits changes that are coming but the uncertainty about them and the lack of information. A service user told me that lack of information heightens stress, which is the last thing that people need. That struck a chord with me. All the uncertainty about what is taking place at Westminster is having a detrimental impact on those people&#8217;s health and wellbeing, before there has even been an announcement about whether the changes will have an economic impact.</p><p>Another concern is the signposting of services and bodies such as the MS Society. Many people said that, when they were diagnosed, they were not given information or directed to the organisations that could benefit them. That is not unique to people with multiple sclerosis; many people have told me that, at the point of diagnosis, the health service needs to provide better signposting to organisations that can provide support and interaction with other people who have conditions.</p><p>My friend whose wife has MS is diabetic. From his experience with his wife, he suggested that he, as a diabetic, has had more support to cope with diagnosis, and more psychology input and education sessions than his wife has had. He says that that needed to be looked at. It might be just a geographical issue, but the minister might want to look at provision of psychology input, education sessions and helping people to cope with the initial diagnosis, which can often cause great stress.</p><p>I will make a final brief point about stigma. In an article in Monday&#8217;s Press and Journal, Marsali Craig&#8212;a woman with MS in Aberdeen&#8212;said that people misunderstand multiple sclerosis and often dismiss people with MS as being lazy or drunk. We need not just education for people who are diagnosed with MS but education about MS for the wider population. I hope that all members will do everything they can to tackle stigma.</p>", "hdate": "2012-05-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22666310", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Multiple Sclerosis Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my colleague George Adam on bringing his motion to the chamber.

It is unacceptable that women who have significant mental health problems are being incarcerated. Those women need to be helped and looked after&#8212;not locked up. When the Cabinet Secretary for Justice considers the recommendations, I hope that he will speak with the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Cities Strategy and her ministerial team about the mental health strategy that the Government is developing, and how women offenders fit into that strategy. It is important that we have cross-departmental work, as well as work that is focused in the justice department.</p><p>I agree with Maureen Watt that we need to consider a culture change in our judicial system and among our judiciary. I understand David McLetchie&#8217;s point that we should respect the independence of the judicial system, but we must engender a change in attitude within that system. It is not just politicians who say that. I quote from John Scott&#8212;not the Deputy Presiding Officer, but the chairman of the Howard League for Penal Reform in Scotland&#8212;who said:</p><p>&#8220;The sentences&#8221;</p><p>that women offenders</p><p>&#8220;are receiving is a significant indicator that it is the judicial response which we need to be looking at.

Lewis Macdonald and Maureen Watt rightly highlighted the community integration unit at Craiginches prison in Aberdeen.

Labour&#8217;s Dundee City Council budget would have cut &#163;210,000 from non-committed spending in the supported services budget that was specifically for buses and would have meant that the council could not have added further routes or invested in existing ones. By contrast, the SNP Administration in Dundee gave &#163;50,000 to National Express, which was in addition to the &#163;500,000 that was given from the Scottish Government green bus fund to support the bringing of 10 eco buses to Dundee. This is about delivering for Dundee, not dithering for Dundee.</p><p>I know that the minister has been outed by Holyrood magazine and that he will get his dancing shoes on in the not-too-distant future, but the Labour Party is undertaking a bizarre dance on concessionary travel.

Naughty ministers are considering doing that.&#8221; It is inconceivable that a member should stand up and say, &#8220;You should consider what somebody else has said, but I&#8217;m not recommending that you actually do what they are suggesting.

Dr Murray said that we did not give the context for the quote and that she did not know to what it referred. I can reveal to Dr Murray that the letter was written directly in response to an article in which FirstGroup in Aberdeen had claimed that the bus service operators grant cuts would cause it problems, a point that was directly contradicted by a Labour council candidate.

I suggested that First in Aberdeen should consider a short-term drop in fares and assess its impact on patronage in the city. That would be a worthwhile experiment for First to undertake. First also needs to look again at whether the routes that it offers meet the needs of the public.

Never has the old quotation, &#8220;Laws are like sausages&#8212;it is better not to see them being made&#8221;, which is often attributed to Otto von Bismarck, been more apt.</p><p>The bill is a complex one that deals with complex issues. Christine Grahame, David McLetchie and Rod Campbell, who, unlike me, are all qualified legal professionals, have identified how difficult a bill it is. As a mere layman, I must be perfectly frank and admit that I have found a deal of the process and the technical content of part 1 extremely difficult to comprehend, and I am sure that many people on the street would do so, too.</p><p>The litmus test of any bill of this Parliament is not whether it makes for easy bedtime reading but whether it will deliver outcomes that are of benefit to wider Scottish society. That is the test that we must apply to any bill that is introduced. I do not think that it is unreasonable that the bill includes extremely complex and technical elements, given that it seeks to resolve a complex legal technicality. The question is whether, in passing the bill, we would deliver benefits. It is through that prism that I will view the bill. I want to assess whether it will have a beneficial impact for society as a whole.</p><p>Graeme Pearson rightly identified that, in that regard, a key consideration must be ensuring that victims, families of victims and witnesses understand the bill and benefit from it. In its response to paragraph 95 of the committee&#8217;s report, the Scottish Government states:</p><p>&#8220;We are keen to explore with stakeholders, in the context of developing a Victims and Witnesses Bill, whether further steps could be taken ... to enhance the ability of victims and witnesses to better understand the practical effect of decisions made.&#8221;</p><p>That is very much a live issue for the Government. It is clear that it is keen to ensure that victims, witnesses and, where appropriate, relatives of victims have an understanding of the process and how it affects them, and what the outcomes of it are likely to be. We should not expect such people to be legal experts, although many of them acquire a good understanding of the legal process as they go through the system. As someone who has spoken to a number of relatives of victims and witnesses, I know that they develop quite a strong understanding of the legal system as a result of their experiences and their exposure to it. As well as accepting the need for such people to understand the legal system, we should not dismiss the fact that many of them develop an acute understanding of how it works.</p><p>We should not lose sight of the fact that, although the two sections in part 1 of the bill have, in effect, been christened with the names of the cases that gave rise to their being necessary, those cases are not the only ones to which those two sections do or could apply. The cabinet secretary has identified that only a small number of cases that are in the system at the moment would fall into that category, but it is worth remembering that the cases in question are very serious criminal cases that give rise to significant public safety concerns. It is therefore important that any anomalies in the judicial process and the sentencing system are dealt with to ensure that cases like Petch and Foye do not arise in future.</p><p>It has been suggested that there should be a wider review of sentencing. The obvious drawback in that is that a quick fix might be required for a situation like that in the Petch and Foye cases. By definition, a wider review of sentencing would take a longer time and the length of time taken could mean that further anomalies would not be prevented. It was therefore perfectly appropriate for the Government to introduce the bill, particularly part 1, as a fix that is required for very serious criminal cases.</p><p>Part 2 was clearly driven by the al-Megrahi case, but we cannot rule out the possibility&#8212;however remote&#8212;that a similar case or another case with similar connotations will arise in future. It is entirely appropriate for the Government to put in place provisions that will allow some of the difficulties that were faced during the process of the al-Megrahi case to be ironed out so that they will not be an issue in future cases.</p><p>I support the bill&#8217;s general principles. I merely observe that, although I do not possess my colleague Mr Finnie&#8217;s understanding of part 1, which he referred to as &#8220;the easy bit&#8221;, we will take up Mr Pearson&#8217;s suggestion&#8212;I have offered to draw the pictures for Mr Finnie&#8217;s book.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665465", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Cases (Punishment and Review) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Where Malcolm Chisholm leads, I will boldly follow, as another non-member of the Justice Committee entering bravely into the fray.

We have recognised that there are some welcome measures contained deep within the budget that relate to, for example, the computer games industry and the offshore sector in my region. Admittedly, they reverse damage that was done before. It is a bit like a person thanking the man who has turned up at their door with a couple of buckets of water, but who had set fire to their house in the first place. Nonetheless, I am a charitable man and welcome the fact that the UK Government has seen the error of its ways in that regard.</p><p>The problem is that we cannot simply extract a couple of welcome gestures in the budget and ignore what is happening more widely. SNP members have emphasised that point throughout the debate. It would be good if, just occasionally, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats showed a little bit of self-awareness and humility and admitted the damage that some of the budget will do, particularly to some of the lowest-paid in society. My colleague Jamie Hepburn made that point eloquently. He pointed out&#8212;he did not use our own figures or party-political spin, but rather the Treasury&#8217;s and the IFS&#8217;s figures&#8212;that the lowest paid 20 per cent will suffer the most hardship as a result of the measures in the budget. That is equivalent to double the average impact on their personal income.</p><p>We can talk about taking people out of paying tax, but all that does is present a panacea, whereas the measure is a fig leaf behind which are hidden the pressures that will be borne by the lowest-paid in society. As a result of the hikes in VAT and fuel duty and the taking away of tax credits, money is being put in people&#8217;s pockets with one hand while the other hand is reaching round to take money out of their other pocket. That is exactly what the UK Government is doing to the lowest-paid in society; it is nothing to do with improving their lot.</p><p>We have heard about what Citizens Advice Scotland has said. The chief executive of Citizens Advice at the UK level, Gillian Guy, has said:</p><p>&#8220;Raising the personal tax allowance is an empty gesture to struggling families on low wages. Poorer working families who get housing and council tax benefits will not get all of the money in their pocket, because as their income goes up, their benefits will go down.&#8221;</p><p>People are being given with one hand, but it is being taken away with the other.</p><p>There were opportunities for growth that could have been pursued as part of the budget, but they were ignored. There is nothing in the budget about improving growth, getting the economy moving and getting people back into work. Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said:</p><p>&#8220;We needed a budget that looked to the future and made jobs&#8212;particularly for young people&#8212;the national priority. Instead we have got a budget for the rich by the rich.&#8221;</p><p>That is exactly what it is. Even Charles Moore, that well-known socialist, made that point, writing in The Daily Telegraph:</p><p>&#8220;I did notice an interesting reply that Mr Osborne gave when challenged on the Today programme about his own income. &#8216;My salary is less than the &#163;150,000 threshold,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I am not a big winner from this Budget.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>By his own admission, those who earn more than &#163;150,000 are the big winners from the budget. It is the rich who are the big beneficiaries as a result of the budget. Simply by employing a clever piece of accountancy trickery, the richest have been able to dictate the level of the highest rate of tax in the country. That is extremely unfortunate.

The message has to be put across that the key consideration is reforming the system and making it work better for parents. That is why there is a legislative context for the commitment to 600 hours.

I find that unfortunate. A failure to give Remploy enough time to make viable businesses is one of the key problems that I have with what is happening.</p><p>I recognise the work that is being done in Dundee, but I will focus on Aberdeen, as it is one of the sites that are specifically earmarked for closure.</p><p>A social enterprise model is being developed in Aberdeen. As Kevin Stewart rightly pointed out, the site operates as a social enterprise hub. For example, Bennachie upholsterers, which is a combination of Cornerstone and Glencraft, operates on the site beside the Remploy factory. A commercial business rents space there, and there is further commercial interest in renting space there, too. Further, a social enterprise is expressing an interest in operating the canteen on the site.</p><p>As part of the attempts to move towards a social enterprise model, Remploy in Aberdeen has developed a textiles business, which it has established as a holistic business, trading within Remploy. However, it is in its infancy and has not yet had time to grow into a successful business and demonstrate its viability. The rug is essentially being pulled from underneath Remploy in Aberdeen, as it has not had a chance to demonstrate its long-term viability. Indeed, although there is a suggestion that a laundry business could be developed at Remploy as a possible future option, the uncertainty that has been created by the UK Government&#8217;s announcement throws that into doubt. That is why I raised with the minister the point about the critical nature of asset transfer.</p><p>Where I differ from the suggestion that Labour puts forward in its amendment is that, following discussions with individuals at Remploy in Aberdeen, I do not think that moving from one model of governmental support to another is necessarily what is being sought. The same applies to article 19 funding. Individuals at Remploy in Aberdeen agree that, where that funding can be unlocked through tendering processes, it would be welcome, but they do not believe that it should be used in every example or as a way of replacing grant-aided expenditure. I agree entirely with the principle that article 19 funding should be considered&#8212;but it should be considered in the wider context of the tendering processes.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664124", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Remploy (United Kingdom Government Response)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The charitable thing to do following Mary Scanlon&#8217;s speech would be to note that at least one of the UK Government parties has bothered to turn up to the chamber to defend its stance in relation to Remploy.

complain about the affordability of childcare while they vote in coalition with the Tories at Westminster to remove tax credits from more than 73,000 families in Scotland and, as Malcolm Chisholm rightly pointed out, to decrease the amount that can be received for childcare costs from 80 to 70 per cent. That will have a detrimental impact on working families and single-parent families in Scotland.</p><p>Liz Smith said in reply to the cabinet secretary&#8217;s intervention that it is better to be in work than on benefits. These people are in work: they receive tax credits because they are in work. The policy that is being pursued by Liz Smith&#8217;s party&#8212;the Conservative Party&#8212;and the Liberal Democrats in government at Westminster is harming working families. These are not well-off working families; there is often a misconception that only the well-off will be affected by the changes. We are talking about any lone-parent family that earns more than &#163;26,000 per year, and any two-parent family that earns more than &#163;32,000 per year, which would be two people earning around &#163;16,500 each&#8212;that is well below the national average. Those are the people who will be harmed by that policy and who will find it all the more difficult to afford childcare as a result.</p><p>I class myself as a parent first and a politician second, and the issue of affordable childcare is close to my heart. I have often spoken to other parents about it when I have been picking my son up from nursery or playgroup. I am well aware of the pressures that people face in finding affordable childcare. The difficulty is often not with the childcare that councils provide but with private sector childcare, and I think that the Government recognises that that must be addressed. We have to try to work with private sector partners wherever possible to ensure that they are delivering affordable and accessible childcare.</p><p>Although no one will deny that we need to consider such issues, I think that it is excellent news that the Scottish Government is increasing funded nursery provision for three and four-year olds and looked-after two-year-olds to 600 hours per week. I am pleased that Mr Bibby welcomed the announcement in his usual charitable fashion, neglecting to mention that, in the previous session, this Government increased provision 20 per cent and in doing so benefited 100,000 children in Scotland.</p><p>That is not the only area in which we have a positive story to tell. We have not only delivered increased provision in free nursery education but invested &#163;10 million in the early years early action fund and the child poverty strategy, which sets out how we will tackle child poverty; developed the BA course in childhood practice, which 1,000 students are taking; and supported local implementation of the early years framework. In my home city of Aberdeen, through the 3Rs&#8212;or reorganise, renovate, rebuild&#8212;schools project, we have developed state-of-the-art facilities, including the fantastic developmental nursery at Seaton, which is delivering for some of the most vulnerable youngsters in our city. That is a positive story that we can tell.</p><p>Mr McArthur should not stand up and say, &#8220;All you get from the SNP is negative, negative, negative.&#8221; We have an extremely positive story to tell and we will continue to tell it to the people of Scotland, who have recognised as much. After all, we have 68 MSPs and the Liberal Democrats five&#8212;or should I say four?

The issue ties in with others on the agenda in Scotland, such as the living wage and pay day loans, which my colleague Margaret Burgess has raised in members&#8217; business before. It is about being mature enough as a Parliament to look at the important issue of the impact of the pay dates that currently operate in Scotland, particularly on those on low pay.</p><p>I am pleased that when I sought a response from organisations such as the Federation of Small Businesses, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and the Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals, they came back with very constructive responses in which they said that they would be willing to look at the issue in a bit more detail. I will come on to that later in my speech.</p><p>The key focus of the debate for me is the impact on low-paid workers. I have been a low-paid employee, as I am sure many members have. Employees receive their pay early in December, which can be a bit of a boost as it is often an expensive time of year with Christmas and new year to come. The drawback is that because many organisations and businesses pay early in December but continue to pay at the end of January, the pay window becomes a six-week window that covers one of the most expensive times of year for many individuals. Individuals who are on a low income have to make that low income stretch for a longer period than would otherwise be the case.</p><p>The reason why I thought that there might be an opportunity to discuss the issue is that the month of February is only a four-week month, so a six-week pay window for the pay that is received early in December is followed by a four-week pay window for the pay that is received at the end of January. It seems perverse that people are expected to make their pay packet stretch for six weeks over December and January but for only four weeks in February.</p><p>My motion highlights the issue of pay day loans. I have spoken to people who, come the middle to the end of January, find things tough and are tempted and seduced by the offer of a short-term cash injection. My colleague, Margaret Burgess, has previously made that point eloquently in the chamber, when she has talked about the difficulties that people on low incomes often face. As a member of Aberdeen City Council, some time ago I approached the then chief executive and suggested that the council might wish to consider changing its January pay date, and the council has now done so, paying in the penultimate week of January rather than at the very end. That approach has been broadly welcomed by the council&#8217;s low-paid workers and the trade unions.</p><p>I lodged my motion with the intention of instigating dialogue and discussion. I recognise that the proposal will not be universally appropriate and I do not seek a prescriptive measure that all companies and organisations must implement. I recognise that for small businesses that employ only a few people and which have cash-flow problems at the end of the month, it will not be appropriate to change the pay date, because they rely on certain income and outgoings being fixed. I do not seek to put such private sector businesses in an awkward position. However, it might be easier for the public sector to implement the measure. I hope that public sector organisations will look at the example of Aberdeen City Council and consider whether this is something that they could introduce. Larger private companies that do not rely so much on month-to-month cash flow might also consider implementing the measure.</p><p>This issue predominantly affects those at the lower end of the pay scale, who suffer the most in the six-week pay window. We should do anything that we can as a Parliament to highlight the issue, and I hope that this will not be the end of the debate but that we will go forward into constructive discussion. I certainly intend to send the Official Report of the debate to the organisations that I spoke to before I lodged my motion, to let them know what members have said and to try to instigate that constructive discussion.</p><p>I am interested to hear what the minister has to say.

However, the Labour Party motion makes not one reference to that concept. We could have had an interesting debate on the concept of local referenda and how to perhaps put in place a framework for them. Instead, we have a motion that Lewis Macdonald has helpfully brought to the Parliament to try to assist his colleagues in Aberdeen City Council in their attempts to win the council election in May. It is unfortunate that parliamentary time is being used for that purpose when the issue rightly belongs in the chamber of Aberdeen City Council and on the doorsteps of the city of Aberdeen.</p><p>I have a couple more quotations that might lead to sober reflection among the Labour Party. One states:</p><p>&#8220;The people of our historic city have voted in a democratic referendum. It is now time for Sir Ian Wood, ACSEF and the city council to return the trust shown in them. I implore all those involved with the City Garden to deliver on their promise of an on budget, sympathetic transformational project. I wish all those involved well.&#8221;</p><p>That was Jimmy Milne, chairman of the Balmoral Group, in the Aberdeen Press and Journal on 7 March 2012. That is significant because Jimmy Milne opposed the city garden project, but he recognises the result of the referendum and the will of the people of Aberdeen to move forward with the project. It is a great pity that Lewis Macdonald cannot recognise the will of the people.</p><p>A final quotation is from Scott Begbie, a columnist in the Evening Express. Again, he was an opponent of the project in advance of the referendum, but he said:</p><p>&#8220;The campaign was hard fought by both sides, the people voted as they saw fit and the die is cast. What happens now is the real test of Aberdeen as a city. A grown-up, mature society would agree to disagree and accept the majority opinion.&#8221;</p><p>It is clear that the Labour Party in the city of Aberdeen is not grown up or mature&#8212;it says no to the city garden project despite the public support; it said no to the Marischal college project, despite the fact that the scheme was delivered &#163;22 million under budget by an SNP administration; it said no to the third Don crossing, which would solve congestion in the city; and it said no to the community stadium, which would help with the regeneration of our city.

As a result of the leadership that was shown by Kevin Stewart, who will sum up in the debate, we moved to a &#163;6.92 wage for the lowest-paid people in the council; the current council leader, Callum McCaig, has indicated that there will be a move to the living wage of &#163;7.20.

That is something that the Scottish Government does not have the legislative power to do, although it can implement the living wage in its departments and it can encourage others to implement the living wage.

During my time on that council, I have served on its fair trade working group.</p><p>The North East Scotland region, which I represent, has a strong story to tell about fair trade. Both its major cities&#8212;Aberdeen and Dundee&#8212;have achieved Fairtrade city status, and Ellon, Huntly, Inverurie and Montrose are towns in the north-east that have achieved Fairtrade town status. The University of Dundee and the University of Aberdeen have achieved Fairtrade university status, and a number of schools have achieved Fairtrade status, including Ellon academy, Montrose academy and some primary schools. There is a strong story to be told in the north-east about fair trade, and I welcome the work that has been done in those and other communities to try to advance the fair trade agenda.</p><p>We often talk about Fairtrade cities and towns, but there can also be Fairtrade zones. I have visited Formartine, which encompasses the villages of Pitmedden, Tarves and Methlick. There, I visited the Fairtrade shop in Tarves. There is a lot of talk about clothing, food, wine, coffee and tea Fairtrade products, but I managed to purchase from that shop Fairtrade wrapping paper at Christmas time in which to wrap Christmas presents. A plethora of goods with the Fairtrade logo attached is now available. Although certain products may be more popularly associated with fair trade, it is important that we make people aware of how many different items they can now buy through the Fairtrade campaign.</p><p>Individuals are working locally to drive campaigns. After I visited the Fairtrade shop in Formartine, I went to the home of Anne Aspden, who is a constituent of mine. She opens up her farmhouse in the village of Pitmedden once a year to sell Fairtrade products and provide fair trade baking, for example, to members of the public who want to go in for a while. The money that is raised goes towards good causes, which is commendable. We should recognise not only the efforts of collectives, but those of passionate individuals, who are often the driving force behind fair trade movements in particular areas. They deserve to be commended for their work.</p><p>A number of events will take place to mark Fairtrade fortnight. Some individuals from Malawi are coming to the north-east. Mr Masauko Khembo&#8212;to whom I apologise profusely for probably having butchered the pronunciation of his name&#8212;who is the chief executive of the Kasinthula cane growers will be giving a talk in Stonehaven on 6 March. I will not be able to make it, but I encourage anyone in the area who is able to go along to do so and listen to the story that Mr Khembo has to tell about how fair trade affects him and other farmers in the third world. On 1 March, a Fairtrade producer from Malawi will visit Arbroath high school to give a presentation to secondary school pupils.</p><p>Fairtrade schools are vital, because young people are often the driving force in this area, and school campaigns often lead to parents and other relatives getting involved in the Fairtrade movement. It is important to take outreach work into the schools.</p><p>It is great that we are having this debate. A lot is being done in Scotland.

My colleagues from the north-east, Kevin Stewart and Dennis Robertson, will speak later in the debate, so I will do what I can do to highlight positive examples from the north-east without engaging in thunder stealing.</p><p>With that in mind, I briefly mention Huntly, which is in Mr Robertson&#8217;s constituency. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments about the town, which is an exemplar in its use of the arts to rebrand itself and become an internationally recognised creative community. Other small communities should emulate the approach. There are plans to use the funding award for a number of exciting projects, including a creative food project. We might hear more about that later. There is a lot to be excited about in Huntly.</p><p>During the year of creative Scotland a number of projects will run in Aberdeen. Aberdeen international youth festival is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. The event has become a leading youth arts festival and one of the most popular festivals in Scotland. About 1,000 talented young people from performing arts companies and music groups across the globe will arrive in Aberdeen to perform at venues large and small, from Aberdeen music hall to the church hall at Queen&#8217;s Cross. The festival will include some outreach events in Aberdeenshire. Indeed, such events have become a festival favourite and recognise not only the city&#8217;s hosting of the festival but the city region&#8217;s role in the area&#8217;s cultural fabric. They are all about reaching out to certain communities who might not find it as easy to get into Aberdeen and enjoy the festival.</p><p>Aberdeen&#8217;s hosting of the British science festival, which promotes the best of knowledge and learning in science, technology and the arts, will play a fundamental part in its contribution to the 2012 year of creative Scotland. The impact of the Olympics has already been mentioned and an Olympic torch relay event in Aberdeenshire will involve a mixture of dance, music and the arts and include a performance by the chart-topping Aberdeenshire artist Emeli Sand&#233; and a participatory dance event. Aberdeen&#8217;s own public Olympic art commission will also be playing a firm role in that.</p><p>Another event called &#8220;The Port&#8221; is a multi-arts collaboration that seeks to connect young people and their wider communities with the changing landscape of Aberdeen city and harbour and will use street performances, large sculptural pieces, dance and music opportunities to develop high-quality local experiences. Although such events are not on the grand scale of some that have been mentioned, they nevertheless play a very important role.</p><p>In an example of the kind of shameless parochiality that I engage in from time to time in the chamber, I want to talk about certain things that might not be directly linked to the year of creative Scotland but which tie in with the sort of community involvement issues that Patricia Ferguson mentioned. A number of play areas in the village of Dyce where I live and which I represent on Aberdeen City Council had fallen into a bad way, but they have since been reinvigorated partly through the installation of art pieces. For example, kids&#8217; sculptures were placed in Central park to give it a more cultural feel. A Sluie Drive park that had fallen into a very bad state of repair was reinvigorated with artworks developed with some of the young children at Dyce play group, who were, as a result, given a real sense of ownership. Moreover, play areas off Princess Drive that had fallen into serious disrepair are now home to some fantastic ground-level street art that has really enhanced interest in the area.</p><p>It is worth mentioning such projects, because they have a role to play in community regeneration and in meeting the year of creative Scotland&#8217;s aim of exploring Scotland&#8217;s culture. This is not just about art in the community; all the projects that I have highlighted involved young people in the community, giving them a sense of ownership and helping communities to feel that the project was theirs and not just something that was imposed on them.</p><p>I was extremely enthused by a recent project involving a collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and my old school Dyce academy that resulted in a piece called &#8220;The Cabaret of Impossible Dreams&#8221;, which was performed at the Forum in Aberdeen. It brought in puppetry, music, mime and dance but the best thing about it was not only that it was created in collaboration with more than 120 school students, but that it brought in the local community to work alongside them and helped to create links that will continue beyond that performance.</p><p>That kind of community-based art should really be promoted. Although it might not attract the kind of headlines that the Edinburgh military tattoo or major festivals such as the Edinburgh fringe attract, that does not make it any less of a vital part of Scotland&#8217;s cultural fabric. It can act as a stepping stone for young people and communities that might not engage in cultural activity to feel a part of it and perhaps to move on and discover other things.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22660211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Year of Creative Scotland 2012"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I direct members to my declaration of interests in respect of my membership of Aberdeen City Council&#8212;that might pop up during my speech.

Scotland&#8217;s music has a strong international reputation, not just because of our folk music, but because of major international artists, from Annie Lennox to Franz Ferdinand and Amy Macdonald, who have found success beyond these shores and in charts throughout the world.</p><p>A concerning feature of the BBC proposals is the effect on opportunities for new and up-and-coming artists, who sometimes need a leg-up to make themselves known to the industry, which all too often is very focused on existing major acts and less so on up-and-coming ones. Such acts might need a bit of cultivation and assistance to make the breakthrough, and shows such as &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221; are vital for that.</p><p>When I was at university in Aberdeen and not long after that, there was a furore because the local radio station Radio Northsound had dropped its hour-long session in which it played music from local bands. If a local band produced an EP, its songs could be played on the show, which would give them exposure to the wider public in the north-east who perhaps did not go to the gigs that took place in the evenings. When that slot went, the argument was that, if those bands wanted to get exposure, most of them would have to leave Aberdeen to cultivate their reputations in the Glasgow music scene, which often drew bands away from Aberdeen. I do not have a problem with artists leaving the area in which they started to make a success of themselves, but that should be out of choice, not necessity and starvation of opportunity.</p><p>That is the concern that I have in relation to &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221;. I was struck by the parallel that exists between the two cases. The further we force people to go to gain recognition, the more difficult we make it for them to make a breakthrough. Bands that previously would have gone from Aberdeen and the north-east to the Glasgow music scene to make their name and cultivate a reputation&#8212;and which might have got a leg-up through &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221; being broadcast from Glasgow&#8212;now might think that, to make the breakthrough, they will have to go to the London music scene. To be perfectly honest, it is much more difficult for a band to make its name and cultivate a reputation in London, because London attracts people from throughout the UK, whereas in Scotland we have a smaller population and therefore, by definition, fewer bands than there are at a pan-UK level.</p><p>A number of Aberdeen bands have gone on to make a modest success of themselves and gain a strong reputation. The punk band The Xcerts gained a number of important support and festival slots having started playing in local clubs in Aberdeen. Another band, Driveblind, went to the United States to make a success of themselves. Bands like that, who left after making a reputation for themselves, might now find themselves having to leave to make their reputation if we lose such opportunities for them.</p><p>I call on the BBC to look at what it is doing and to think about the impact that its decision is likely to have on cultural output from nations such as Scotland. Let us not forget Wales and Northern Ireland, which are just as important to this issue. We should unite in solidarity with the campaigners in those nations who are trying to save their local opt-out and the opportunities that it provides to their local artists. Hopefully, a united campaign, as is being fought, and as Joan McAlpine has highlighted tonight, will be successful. I call on the BBC to reverse its decision.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22659334", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;Introducing in Scotland&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my colleague Joan McAlpine on securing this extremely important debate on a vital issue that relates to the cultural fabric of Scotland.

Luckily, I am flexible and will do my best to come up with some stuff for the committee.</p><p>Although, as the convener rightly said, the debate is about trying to find answers from members in the chamber, I think that he might well get constructive suggestions instead. After all, the issue is too difficult for any of us to claim that we have some kind of silver bullet answer or range of answers to it.</p><p>We certainly need to consider the question of achievement versus attainment, because narrowing the focus to attainment might exclude those who are not academically inclined. I am not suggesting that there are not looked-after children who are academically inclined, but the figures seem to indicate that looking at achievement might be a way of broadening and improving looked-after children&#8217;s experience of the education system. Focusing on activities other than purely academic ones might be beneficial for the children concerned and more widely.</p><p>Exclusions are worth looking at, too. I question whether exclusion is the appropriate approach to take, particularly with looked-after children. The figures make for fairly sober reading. Aberdeen City Council has a figure of 627 exclusions per 1,000 looked-after pupils, compared with a national figure of 365 per 1,000 looked-after pupils. The figure for Argyll and Bute Council is 417 and that for Dundee City Council is 525. One figure leaped out at me&#8212;that for South Ayrshire Council, where the number of looked-after children is 31 and the total number of exclusions of looked-after children is 28. South Ayrshire Council is the only local authority that I managed to find&#8212;I did not look at figures for every local authority&#8212;where the number of exclusions of looked-after children is lower than the total number of looked-after children. Crucially, South Ayrshire&#8217;s figure for the number of exclusions per 1,000 looked-after pupils is 161, which is less than half the national level.</p><p>What is being done in South Ayrshire? Is a different approach being taken that is leading to those figures? The committee might want to consider looking at that in more detail. I do not have the answer before me, but South Ayrshire&#8217;s figures leaped off the page as being different from and standing out against the national picture. A closer look at arrangements there might be beneficial.</p><p>Opportunities are also worth considering. Educational attainment or experience is one thing, but we need to consider what happens after that. Kevin Stewart quite rightly mentioned the family firm approach that is being taken in Aberdeen and the apprenticeships and internships that are being offered by businesses and the council itself. He was correct in what he said about positive discrimination. Given the negative experiences that looked-after children face throughout their childhood, being positive in giving them a helping hand is entirely justified, both in our role as corporate parents and generally, from a moral point of view.</p>", "hdate": "2012-01-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22658271", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Educational Attainment of Looked-after Children"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am not taking an intervention at this point.

It is not necessarily fair for me to comment on the process behind the production of the report, other than to remark that the fairly comprehensive list of witnesses and evidence sessions at annex A indicates that the committee undertook a great deal of scrutiny during the course of producing the report.</p><p>Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the report make it clear that this is a challenging economic climate and that the Government is facing a challenging settlement. Paragraph 5 states that the budget will decrease by 12.3 per cent in real terms over the course of the spending review, with a 7 per cent reduction coming in this year alone. That makes this financial year extremely challenging. Even those who are wedded to a particular political ideology or a particular direction of political travel would accept the financial challenges that the Scottish Government is facing.</p><p>It is clear that, in these challenging times and within that difficult settlement, there need to be clear statements of priority from the Government. I welcome the fact that three clear priorities are being set: the acceleration of economic recovery and the creation of jobs through the low-carbon economy; public sector reform, with a dramatic shift to preventative spend; and the introduction of a social wage.</p><p>I will focus my remarks on the preventative spend agenda. The agenda that the Scottish Government is pursuing represents one of the biggest changes&#8212;if not the biggest&#8212;in the mindsets and agendas of Governments in my lifetime, which I realise has not been very long. In my time in politics, as a local councillor or working within the political system, I have always been frustrated by the short-termism that often dominates the political agenda and ignores the longer-term picture. The cabinet secretary has recognised that point in his shift towards preventative spend, which takes a longer-term view of the situation.</p><p>It is important to recognise the need to involve third sector partners in the shift to preventative spend, given their role in the agenda. The recommendations in paragraph 135 of the report are welcome in that regard, because they recognise the need to set the third sector in its rightful place as a key partner in the move to preventative spend.</p><p>Some concerns were raised during the course of the evidence sessions about the amount of money being directed towards preventative spend over the course of the spending review. In that regard, I will make three observations. First, given that we have a fixed budget that is under increasing pressure from outside influences that this Parliament cannot control, I do not think that &#163;500 million over the period is an insignificant sum to direct towards a preventative spend agenda and a change in focus.</p><p>Secondly, that &#163;500 million is the direct allocation from central Government. Other budgets are controlled at local level by local authorities, NHS boards and other public bodies and it is up to them to prioritise within their own budget settlement how they want the preventative spend agenda to operate locally. It will be interesting to see how that develops and I am sure that the cabinet secretary and his colleague, the newly appointed Minister for Local Government and Planning, will have key discussions with those bodies, particularly local government partners, on how they deliver this agenda in their areas. In fact, there has been something of a transition to preventative spend in some places. For example, Aberdeen City Council has made efforts to redesign services and remodel them into a more preventative and early intervention approach. That mindset would be welcomed in other local authority areas; indeed, I am sure that members across the chamber will be able to highlight examples from their own areas.</p><p>Thirdly, I contend that the preventative spend agenda is just as much about the mindset as it is about the money. The redirection of resources and redesign of services can unlock significant savings and deliver real benefits to the public. If every pound spent on intervention can save many tens of pounds in other areas, that is simply a no-brainer to me.

One of the key points about such advocacy for mental health sufferers is that it can save substantial amounts of money in other areas.

No doubt he is telling the captains of Brazilian industry that they are doing well but would have done so much better if they had stayed under Portuguese control.</p><p>The opportunities for all scheme is significant and will provide for 16 to 19-year-olds.</p><p>Positive work is also being done on the ground. I will highlight some examples from the north-east. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth has visited Aberdeen Foyer and will be aware of the work that it does to try to alleviate youth homelessness and unemployment in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. As a north-east member, Richard Baker will also be aware of that work. Aberdeen Foyer offers a number of programmes, of which I will highlight a couple.</p><p>The training for work programme provides training support for people aged 18 and above who are unemployed and actively looking for work. It provides a range of specialist vocational training and, crucially, on-the-job experience. The employers who offer those opportunities range from small businesses right up to multinational companies. They also range across the construction, retail, hospitality and administration sectors. The programme offers opportunities and helps to increase young people&#8217;s employability, which is also important. It is about not only increasing employment but increasing employability and giving young people the skills that they require to make the transition into the workplace.</p><p>There is also the Prince&#8217;s Trust team, which works to enable 16 to 25-year-olds to develop confidence, motivation and skills. We should remember that, for many young people, going to an interview or trying to access work is a daunting experience. We must empower them to make that transition.</p><p>Another project that I will highlight is the youth opportunities database project for Aberdeenshire, which has been helpfully and amusingly acronymised to the YODA project. It allows young people aged 16 to 19 who may require additional support to gain a place in education, employment or training in order to secure a positive destination on leaving school or, if they are in learning programmes, increase their employability skills.</p><p>The project has a number of aims. It aims to close the skills gap, particularly for the bottom 20 per cent of young people in schools who need additional support; to develop the basic skills and confidence of those who have disengaged from education or are at risk of doing so; to increase employability through education, training and volunteering opportunities; and to support and develop projects that target young people during the crucial transition to adulthood. That time is often very difficult for young people and, in some cases, they require support. The project was initially a pilot project that was run over the 2010 winter period but, due to a diverse range of people applying and the feedback that was received, it has been extended and will continue for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The First Minister rightly spoke about the responsibility that we all have, including adult Scots, but there are examples of young Scots who are looking out for each other. In Aberdeen, there is the Mastrick young unemployed project, which tries to help into work unemployed young people and single parents, for example. The project&#8217;s committee is almost exclusively made up of young people. Young people are looking to help each other to get that vital first step into the workplace.</p><p>Good work is therefore being done that could be replicated in other areas. We all have a responsibility to share in the chamber best practice from the communities that we represent. SNP members do not for one second underestimate the challenge that faces us, but we have a duty as parliamentarians to highlight in the Parliament the good things that are happening and to see whether they can be replicated elsewhere. We owe it to young people to do everything in our power to move them forward. We should not simply come to the Parliament and say that things are going badly; rather, we must ensure that what we do in the Parliament drives forward an agenda to make things better.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22656106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Unemployment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That is on the record.

It is clear from what the minister has said, and indeed from the increase in respite, the announcement on the change fund and today&#8217;s announcement on short breaks, that that intent is being backed up by action.</p><p>I have heard others across the chamber say that we are not there yet. I would point out that we are one year into a five-year strategy. I know that the Government is good, but if it were to achieve everything in a five-year strategy in the first year alone, it would be doing one hell of a job. The minister has quite rightly acknowledged that there are still challenges to be faced.</p><p>In my speech, I will focus on what is essentially a tale of two carers. Over the summer, thanks to the work of Lynn Williams of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and Lucy Whiteman of VSA Aberdeenshire, I shadowed a carer for a day. I shadowed Stephanie Chalmers, who cares for her son Connor in Turriff in the north-east. Connor is 10, he has cerebral palsy and he requires 24/7 care. During the course of the day, I did what I could to help Stephanie, whether by pushing the wheelchair into the car, helping feed Connor his lunch or joining him in playing his Xbox, which is an interest that we share. The day drove home to me the strain that parent carers often feel and highlighted the fact that, sometimes, it is the little things that help to make a difference and assist people.</p><p>I will highlight two points today. I could highlight a myriad, but I will focus on a couple that we perhaps do not often consider.</p><p>The first point is that carers often have to locate support networks themselves because the NHS and local authorities do not readily highlight them to them. Such networks can be highly beneficial because people share their experiences and a camaraderie forms. We need to change our attitude and provide that information to carers, rather than leave them to seek it out on top of doing everything else.</p><p>The other point relates to something that is key for Stephanie and her husband and by which I was quite surprised. For Connor to go to the toilet they require a hoist, but the only disabled toilet in the north-east that has a hoist is in Union Square in Aberdeen. I wrote to the Government about that and am pleased that it is reviewing the building standards regulations to ensure that such facilities are more prevalent.</p><p>Little things like that make a big difference to carers, particularly their physical wellbeing. Although he is 10, Connor is a big boy. As he grows older, he will get bigger and it will become more difficult to do simple things such as take him to the toilet.</p><p>The second carer I will mention is my mother. I have said in previous debates that she was a carer. She cared for my grandmother, who suffered from dementia and passed away in early October. I saw at first hand the work that my mother did to care for my grandmother.</p><p>The two impacts of caring that have been brought home to me are the health impacts and the financial impacts.</p><p>If Connor does not sleep, Stephanie and her husband do not sleep; if my grandmother did not sleep, my mother did not sleep. We sometimes forget that caring is often a 24/7, 365-day-a-year role. No night shift comes in to let carers go away. Although respite care is crucial, it is only a part of the overall solution. We must ensure that we do everything possible to protect carers&#8217; physical and emotional health and wellbeing because, if we do not, they will become tomorrow&#8217;s cared-for. I know that the minister and the Government are aware of the need to support carers in that way.</p><p>I touched on the financial impacts in my intervention on Richard Simpson. Bill Kidd touched on them as well. The carers allowance is, to be frank, a joke. In essence, it is blackmail, because the United Kingdom Government knows that carers will not give up caring for their relatives, because they do it for love and that will prevent them from downing tools no matter how hard it gets. It is almost as if it is saying that it knows that they will not give up, so there is no impetus for it to give them a better deal. That is shameful.</p><p>The Parliament should unite and say that enough is enough. It is time that the UK Government examined carefully the fundamental role that carers play and exactly what the impact on the health service and social care would be if they were to down tools.</p><p>At the moment, many people who care do not even qualify for the carers allowance. We spoke about young carers. If someone is in full-time education, they are excluded from claiming the carers allowance. If someone is in part-time education and their course lasts for more than 21 hours a week, it is classed as a full-time course. Therefore, young carers are, in effect, discouraged and dissuaded from going into further education if they want to be able to claim some kind of financial support once they turn 16. Before they turn 16, no financial support is available to them. We must change our mentality, because 100,000 young carers are doing without. We need to consider that situation carefully and reflect on how we can change it.</p><p>The other week, I attended the reception for Tommy on tour. Tommy Whitelaw, a carer, walked across Scotland collecting stories from carers who look after loved ones with dementia. I met him when he was in Aberdeen and my mum wrote to him to tell her story. At the reception, a DVD was shown in which carers told their stories of what it is like to care for a loved one with dementia. It was extremely moving and I encourage everyone to watch it. If anyone wants, I will gladly send them the link, because it makes for powerful viewing.</p><p>The Scottish Government has the right intention and the action to back it up is happening. I look forward to working with the Government over the next four years to ensure that the strategy is fully implemented.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655398", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carers and Young Carers Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much welcome the strategy and the strong statement of intent that it contains.

It was a constructive debate, which was handled constructively by all parties across the chamber. It is good to see that I appear to have set the tone for oil and gas debates in the Parliament this session&#8212;long may that continue.</p><p>I agree with much that has been said by all members in today&#8217;s debate thus far. Lewis Macdonald rightly referred to some of the tragedies that have taken place in the North Sea. One of the fatalities in the recent Super Puma crash, Stuart Wood from Newmachar, was in the year below me at Dyce academy and played in the school football team with me, so the issue affects many people in my peer group, with whom I grew up. I note that the report on that crash is due out soon and I have no doubt that lessons will be learned in the industry.</p><p>I agree with the minister that it is important to focus on the positives and to look forward. The Scottish Government has been engaged constructively and, I hope, productively with the UK Government on the taxation regime in the North Sea. Although one would undoubtedly have hoped that the previous decision would have been taken following slightly more consultation with the industry, one hopes that, moving forward, there will be a period of consultation, which would help to alleviate concerns in the industry caused by some last-gasp decision making. I hope that the UK Government&#8217;s ears are open to that argument when the minister makes it to them.</p><p>I agree that there is a need to address skills gaps. In particular, Oil &amp; Gas UK has highlighted to me that a gap exists in the middle between those who are graduate entrants or young entrants into the industry and those who are coming to the brink of retirement. One of the reasons why that gap exists is a subconscious mood out there that somehow the industry did not have a future. The short-termism that often defined the way in which the oil and gas industry was talked about led people to consider that it was perhaps not an attractive industry to move into. That has created something of a problem and a requirement for the gap to be filled.</p><p>The oil and gas industry advisory group has identified six priorities, one of which is skills. That is extremely important. I note that the PWC report refers to the work by, for example, Talisman and Wood Group in offering university scholarships. Indeed, the report encourages other companies in the sector to consider moving down a similar route.</p><p>Along with a number of other members, I attended the launch of Professor Alex Kemp&#8217;s worthy tome on the history of North Sea oil and gas. [Interruption.] Bless you, Ms Boyack. It was interesting to note, in the course of that evening, how many of the students on Professor Kemp&#8217;s course come from other areas of the world, where oil and gas sectors are seen as a long-term prospect, and how few people from the locale were on the course. We must do more to encourage people to believe that this is an industry that they can go into and that it will not decline within 10 to 25 years, as was so often the mantra.</p><p>I welcome the shift in focus that has taken place, which is constructive. Had some of our opponents&#8217; political predecessors perhaps had the foresight to talk up the longevity of the industry to the same extent, some of the problems might not have arisen.</p><p>We had a discussion earlier today on female employment. OPITO produced a report that suggests that there has been an increase in the number of females being attracted to work in the oil and gas industry, which has often been viewed as very masculine and macho.</p><p>Work has been done, for example by Aberdeen College and the sector, to try to provide places for people from Kinloss and Lossiemouth, who are leaving the Ministry of Defence, on the drilling transformation training programme that is planned at Aberdeen College. The Prince&#8217;s Trust has also worked on developing a new basic entry programme for unemployed and disadvantaged workers. The industry has undertaken all that positive work, which we should welcome.</p><p>I am pleased that Mr Brown was able to clarify that the Tory amendment does not seek to disregard the PricewaterhouseCoopers report in its entirety, because there is much in that report that is worthy and to be commended. The report identifies that up to 24 billion barrels of oil could be extracted from the UK continental shelf. In fact, there is some discussion in the oil industry about whether that estimate could be increased depending on further investment and exploration. The west of Shetland fields, for example, could generate upwards of $600 billion in the next 40 years alone.</p><p>The report states that contrary to the view that North Sea production is in terminal decline, the outlook for the oil and gas industry in Aberdeen is positive. There is a wealth of exciting opportunities that will enable Aberdeen to continue prospering, through utilising new technology to extend the life of existing fields or through developing incremental reserves or greenfield sites. I am sure that my fellow members for the north-east and Aberdeen welcome, as I do, that analysis and the industry&#8217;s positive vision for the future of Aberdeen. I accept entirely the chancellor&#8217;s contention that investment is taking place. That is evident from BP, TAQA and Premier Oil, from the recent announcement from Talisman Energy and Wood Group and from the acquisition of ExxonMobil assets by Apache.</p><p>At the same time, though, there is a real need to focus in on the brownfield and marginal sites, which are the ones that are most affected by the tax changes. That is why I hope that the constructive discussions that are taking place will result in something a little better in the future.</p><p>A simple equation is that skills development depends on investment and investment depends on confidence. I am pleased that it appears that there will be no more short-termism and no more talking down the future prospects of the industry. Parliament should unite to say that oil and gas has a robust and optimistic future. The issue must be handled carefully. I know that the Scottish Government and the minister will be working to ensure that the next 40 to 50 years are handled better than the previous 40 years.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655279", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Oil and Gas Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In June, I had a members&#8217; business debate on oil and gas taxation.

I am grateful to my colleague Kevin Stewart for allowing me to focus on the work that is done at Rosewell house and Smithfield court, if for no other reason than that my speech would otherwise have been very short.</p><p>Rosewell house, which I have mentioned before in the chamber, opened in Aberdeen in 2009. It is a purpose-built 60-bed care home that provides residential, respite and rehabilitation places in a partnership approach between the council and the NHS. When we talk about the need for the integration of health and social care services and the need for the NHS to work more closely with council services, Aberdeen has a good story to tell. I will come to that again when I talk about Smithfield court. Rosewell house has a large therapy suite and rehabilitation is delivered jointly by the council and NHS Grampian. Crucially, over time, the number of residential beds at Rosewell house will be reduced until it does not offer residential places, which ties in with the rehabilitation and reablement approach that is being taken. The facility is helping Aberdeen City Council to achieve extremely good delayed discharge figures.</p><p>Besides that, there is Smithfield court, with which my colleague, Kevin Stewart, is extremely familiar. Not only is it in the council ward that he represents, it is at the bottom of the street where he lives, so he has a good knowledge of the facility. It is a multistorey sheltered housing complex within which 22 flats have been adapted for rehabilitation and within which NHS physiotherapy and occupational therapy staff operate. The council housing service collaborates closely with NHS Grampian to deliver those services, which are another key component in the council&#8217;s bid to reduce the number of delayed discharges.</p><p>Clare Adamson made an important point about trips and falls. Aberdeen City Council is looking at a downsizing scheme that tries to house people in more appropriate surroundings, which is something that other councils could do. Often, elderly people live in the three-bedroom or four-bedroom council properties that they lived in with their families. When the family have grown up and moved out, those elderly people continue to live alone in such properties. We must do what we can to facilitate their moving to more appropriate properties such as amenity bungalows, where there is less likelihood of a trip and fall occurring because they do not have to go up and down stairs to get to their bedroom or bathroom.</p><p>I would be grateful if the Presiding Officer would grant me a little leniency to speak briefly about the Dundee pilot scheme that I mentioned in my intervention on Malcolm Chisholm. The pilot scheme looked at a control group of 22 people who did not receive the enablement service and 22 people who received it. Over a six-week period, the number of hours of care that were required by the enablement sample group went from 314 to 154, whereas the number of hours of care required by the control group went from 275 to 204. Crucially, over a six-month period, the number of hours of care required went from 314 to 107 in the enablement group and from 275 to 279.5 in the control group. That shows that enablement services have a real role to play. There is a clear difference between savings in care hours and cuts in care hours. When savings in care hours are made, it is because people have been inappropriately placed in care packages&#8212;we have heard examples of that from around the chamber. We often put people into care packages because we think that it is the right thing to do, but it is not always the right thing to do, as those examples demonstrate.

It is unfortunate that we tend to hear only about social care failings in cases such as those of Brandon Muir and Baby P. We should reflect on the fact that for every such high-profile case that is mentioned, dozens of examples of good practice take place in social care departments across the country. The fact that we do not hear enough of the good examples is perhaps an understandable reflection of the notion that good news does not sell papers, but it ought to give us pause for thought and we should do more to celebrate the good that is going on while ensuring that high-profile cases such as those that I have mentioned do not happen.</p><p>We have discussed preventative spending and I want to highlight some examples of work that has been done in Aberdeen City Council with looked-after children. The first thing that we ought to try to do is offer rehabilitation and attempt to keep people from going into the care system in the first place. That is why the council took the decision to set up an intensive community support and learning service, based on Westburn Road in Aberdeen. It provides a direct alternative to care, offers individual, family and group work and education and learning programmes on site, and tries its best to help children at an early stage to avoid their having to be placed in care. The whole-system youth justice approach that has also been piloted recently in Aberdeen has received a positive evaluation as well as national recognition.</p><p>The council is also making efforts to help looked-after children access the workplace, as well as taking more steps to assist them as they move on from the care setting. We should not forget that looked-after children become adults and we must do all that we can to ensure that their transition to places such as work and their own home is made as easy as possible for them as they leave care.</p><p>I mentioned some of the high-profile cases that are highlighted by the media. Following such cases, we tend to see an increase in the number of concerns raised with social care departments. That can often, but not always, lead to increases in the numbers of looked-after children and children being put forward for potential care placements, which puts pressure on the work of the social care departments.</p><p>My colleague Kevin Stewart mentioned out-of-authority placements. In June 2009, there were 38 out-of-authority placements at Aberdeen City Council and today there are 23. A lot of work has been done to try to bring children who were placed out of the authority area back to a more appropriate and local setting. We should be aware that although it is sometimes necessary for children to be placed outwith the local authority area, that should always be the very last resort. All too often, in the past, that was not the case. It was often the place of first, rather than last, resort.</p><p>I was mildly amused to hear my colleague Kevin Stewart talking about overspends at Dundee City Council and how they were all right&#8212;those of us who had experience of Kevin as chair of the finance committee at Aberdeen City Council are not used to hearing him say such things.

It is clear that money should not be the driving objective, but if we can achieve that difference of spend by placing children in appropriate foster care, it is surely a win-win situation.</p><p>I agree that more can and should be done on kinship care. We at Aberdeen City Council have an ambition and an aspiration to reach full equivalence and the 85 per cent funding that is being put forward will undoubtedly help in that regard, but it would be unfair not to mention that the situation for kinship carers has improved dramatically in the past four years compared with the baseline of the situation in 2007.</p><p>The debate has not focused as much on the difficulty in achieving adoption places for older children. Many would-be parents who come forward looking for children to adopt are looking for babies or very small children. There is an unwillingness to consider older children, who are often seen as carrying baggage and who often display challenging behaviours. It takes a special person to be able to deal with those behaviours and it is often difficult to get people to come forward. A deal of education and other work is needed to change the mindsets of the people who come forward to adopt children. We must ensure that older children who require an adoption place are not left lingering and waiting.</p><p>I remember as a councillor watching a video that was made by and featured looked-after children in Aberdeen who spoke about their experiences, what they felt was good and bad and what they believed should be changed.

It is holding its first ever under-fives week this week. It regularly holds an over-50s week, when the over-50s can sample what the centre has to offer. In the under-fives week, it is promoting a range of activities for children from kindergym to messy play to music and dance.</p><p>We often forget the quality that can be brought into children&#8217;s lives from engaging in such activities; we focus far too much on taking a hard-nosed educational view, but other kinds of activity for the under-fives are often vital in helping them to form early social skills and to move on into education.</p><p>We should not forget to focus on parents as well as children. During the under-fives week, there are also activities for parents. The community centre has set up support groups for things such as breastfeeding and post-natal depression, in an effort to assist parents and give them the support they need so that they can make a positive impact on their children&#8217;s early years. The Government and its agencies have a role to play in those early years, but we should never overlook the need to support the vital role of parents. Parents will also support each other in having a positive impact in the lives of their children.</p><p>I will now consider secondary education and collaborative approaches. My secondary school, Dyce academy, has long taken a collaborative approach, sharing with the former Bankhead academy and now Bucksburn academy higher and advanced higher courses. Children from each school can go to the other for those courses. Alternatively, courses can be run jointly by the schools. That can help many pupils who might otherwise struggle to attain the qualifications that they wish to, or which they require in order to get to university. That is especially true in some of the more niche subjects. I would not have been able to do sixth year studies in English had the course not been run jointly; there was not sufficient interest in my school alone. That collaboration has been running for a number of years, and perhaps other schools across Scotland need to consider working in such a way with neighbouring schools. Many members will know of similar examples from their areas.</p><p>I turn now to links between schools, colleges and universities&#8212;the final stage of the educational journey. A number of good examples exist in my area. The aspire north programme is a collaboration between universities, colleges and schools that tries to engage with pupils in S3 to S6 and to raise their awareness of the value of further and higher education, to encourage aspiration and build self-confidence.</p><p>There are also good partnership links between colleges and universities. The University of Aberdeen has built strong links with Banff and Buchan College and Aberdeen College, and there is the unilink programme between Robert Gordon University and Aberdeen College, offered on a two-plus-two basis&#8212;students can do two years of a college course and then go straight into third year at university. That helps to break down some of the barriers that exist to access to higher education for those who perhaps cannot make the direct leap from secondary school to university. They are given the opportunity to bridge the gap. Consideration should be given to the question whether such collaborative approaches can be replicated elsewhere in Scotland.</p><p>I regret the notion that Ken Macintosh introduced&#8212;that universities are somehow elitist institutions. That rhetoric belongs in the past. It does not reflect my experience of Scottish universities, or the experience of anybody I know.

We should focus our efforts on early detection, rather than diverting money towards end-of-life treatments for cancer patients. I fully accept that this is an emotive issue, but we must always take into account the fact that in many cases prolonging life does not increase quality of life.

I welcome Elaine Murray&#8217;s acknowledgment that, as long as the UK is negotiating on Scotland&#8217;s behalf for such a vital Scottish interest, it must be the Scottish minister who is at the top table.</p><p>As long as we are party to the CFP, we must ensure that it is designed in a way that works best&#8212;or in the least worst way&#8212;for our fishermen and fishing communities. I think that there is cross-party consensus that the common fisheries policy is not good for Scotland and its fishermen. That is why in some respects I struggle to reconcile Elaine Murray&#8217;s contention that we must trust the UK Government to have our nation&#8217;s interests at heart with her concerns&#8212;which I share&#8212;that tradeable fishing quotas could have a potentially devastating impact on the Scottish industry. Given that, according to the cabinet secretary, the UK Government seems to be persuaded or, indeed, seduced by that approach, it strikes me that a potential logical non sequitur is at play. Even allowing for Alex Fergusson&#8217;s understandable caveat on how tradeable quotas could potentially be implemented, we can probably rely on history to instruct us that, when it comes to the EU and the UK operating on behalf of Scotland&#8212;or supposedly on its behalf&#8212;the wrong choice is usually made. We should therefore probably be very cautious about tradeable quotas.</p><p>The cabinet secretary referred to the infamous Tory memorandum that said of Scotland&#8217;s fishing fleet that</p><p>&#8220;in the wider UK context, they must be regarded as expendable&#8221;.</p><p>Interestingly, Murdo Fraser seems to have reached the same conclusion about the Scottish Conservatives. Alex Johnstone said that the Labour Party is implicated in this situation as well. I accept that Labour does not have a glowing record when it comes to standing up for the Scottish fishing fleet.</p><p>The figures show that 70 per cent of the UK catch is landed in Scotland and that, in 2009, 38.4 per cent was landed in ports in the north-east. Between 1997 and 2009, there was a nearly 90 per cent decline in landings at Aberdeen and an 8.5 per cent decline in Fraserburgh. That was linked entirely to demersals and the impact that total allowable catches and quotas had on those stocks. There was a modest increase of 2.7 per cent in the landings at Peterhead, which I suspect we can link to the pelagic sector, which has undergone a phenomenal increase. Nevertheless, overall, there was a 16.3 per cent decline in the number of fish landed at north-east ports. Obviously, that has had a devastating impact on fishing communities across the north-east, as any member who represents that area or has visited those communities will know. That is why tradeable quotas represent a threat to our smaller ports. If the worst-case scenario is borne out, large amounts of quota will be purchased from Scottish fishermen&#8212;who will take the opportunity to make money by selling their quota, as they would be perfectly entitled to do&#8212;without there being any guarantee that that quota of fish will be landed in Scottish ports, which would mean that the ports would suffer. If there is a decline in the number of ports due to closure, the industry is unlikely to be viable. If quotas are sold, the ports might decline to such a state that they are incapable of coping with landings in the future. That is a vicious circle that could lead to significant problems for the industry.</p><p>There can be no doubt that the UK Government&#8217;s record on negotiating for Scotland and Scotland&#8217;s fishing fleet is lamentable, if not disgraceful. That is why it is vital that we go further than simply ensuring that the Scottish Government works with the UK Government. I fully accept that the cabinet secretary will do all that he can to persuade UK ministers to take Scotland&#8217;s interests to heart, but the sad fact is that, once the UK minister sits down at the table, all the persuading that the cabinet secretary will have done will matter nothing while that minister trades away Scotland&#8217;s rights and fishing fleet. We absolutely must have a situation in which the cabinet secretary is the man at the table who is negotiating on behalf of Scotland&#8217;s fishing industry, whether that be as the head of the UK delegation or&#8212;my preference&#8212;of an independent Scottish delegation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651499", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Common Fisheries Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Therefore, the most important thing is that the lead minister in the negotiations is the Scottish minister.

One of those companies is Keenan Recycling of Turriff, which for several years has been recycling food and garden waste into compost material. The company can process up to 100,000 tonnes every year and now operates the largest vertical composting unit in Europe. The recycled organics are used in products that benefit the end users, communities and the environment.

Both are small local enterprises with community benefits and which provide meaningful employment for adults with learning disabilities and minor physical disabilities. They involve taking delivery of uncontaminated wood pallets and turning them into garden furniture and other items. Michael McMahon spoke about the consumer demand for newness but, particularly in times of economic difficulties, there is a focus on, and genuine interest in, products that have been developed in a way that involves reuse. Those enterprises provide not just environmental value, but social value. We must consider that in thinking about how to deal with the waste hierarchy.</p><p>Another project that I want to highlight is The Box Room in Banchory, which is a community project that takes old furniture and either sells it on or passes it to good causes. I mention it because it launched the magpie project, which it runs in partnership with Aberdeenshire Council and which is a scheme that aims to divert waste from landfill. It involves intercepting reusable household objects and furniture that are brought to the household waste and recycling centre in Aberdeenshire and then selling them or passing them on to local good causes. All too often, we do not see that part of the process. We see things going to the waste recycling centre and assume automatically that they will either go to landfill or somewhere else, but there are often small social enterprises that can deal with them. If such enterprises do not exist in other areas, we need to consider how to encourage local authorities or entrepreneurs to consider taking that approach to diverting waste. The magpie project was so successful that it had to relocate to new premises after only seven weeks, such was the demand.</p><p>I do not dispute for one second that local concerns exist on waste incineration. We have heard them in the north-east, most recently in Peterhead, where an application caused a great deal of protest and was rejected by the local authority. However, we must be careful that we do not get into a situation in which we automatically rule out an approach to waste management that is based on particular examples. We have to be cautious in that regard. I urge members to consider the issue on a broad basis. There will always be local concerns, but we must have an eye on the bigger picture.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650819", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Waste Management"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I know that the Labour Party does not oppose energy from waste per se, and I give it credit for that.

I believe that, through investment and working with industry, we can achieve them. We must ensure that industry views the transition not as a cost burden but as an investment that will bring long-term benefits.</p><p>In addition, we must look at the jobs that can be created as a result of our move to a low-carbon economy. We have spoken a lot about how we can create jobs to match the apprenticeships that we want to provide and to stimulate economic growth. We can do that by making the transition to a low-carbon economy, by providing support for the development of jobs in renewable energy&#8212;support that Scotland&#8217;s colleges have welcomed&#8212;and by creating hundreds of thousands of jobs to support offshore wind development and the other renewable developments that will come forward. These are exciting times.</p><p>However, it is not enough just to have ambition&#8212;that has to be matched with action. The Government&#8217;s record on matching its ambition with action stands up to scrutiny. Over the past four years, the Government has consented to 42 renewable projects that will provide more than 2GW-worth of energy. That is matching ambition with action.</p><p>More needs to be done to move to a low-carbon economy, not just as regards the creation of jobs and the need to improve our economic performance, although both of those are important; it is also important that we take steps to future-proof Scotland against increasingly volatile fuel and energy prices. If we are to protect ourselves from exposure to those variations, we must take steps to move towards a low-carbon economy. That will provide protection not just for vulnerable individuals but for vulnerable communities, particularly our rural communities, which will feel those increases in cost the hardest.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s energy skills investment plan identified up to 95,000 job opportunities across the energy sector. To a member who represents the north-east of Scotland, where the energy sector is extremely prominent, that is welcome news. The energy sector there will have a key role to play as we move from a carbon-based, carbon-dependent economy towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p>I note that the amendment of Patrick Harvie&#8212;who is not in the chamber&#8212;which was not selected for debate, said that economic growth and GDP were not the be-all and end-all, and I note the report by a number of organisations that looks at other ways of measuring improvements across Scotland.</p><p>I fully agree that we should not base our final decision on whether Scotland as a nation has progressed and improved purely on the measurement of economic growth, but I think that it would be accepted that economic growth is fundamental to all the factors that have been identified, whether job satisfaction, economic security, education and training, income and wealth or crime in communities. They all have a direct link to economic growth, which is why the Government&#8217;s economic strategy is so crucial and so welcome. Although I do not disagree with the notion that we should not focus entirely on economic growth as measured by GDP as the barometer of success, it is fundamental and underpins everything. If we want to make Scotland a fairer, wealthier, happier and safer place, we must ensure that economic growth as measured by GDP is at the heart of what we do.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22650703", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: &#8220;The Government Economic Strategy&#8221;"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Last week, Mr Findlay was rather unkind to me and told me rather curtly to sit down when I tried to intervene on him.

That is disappointing, but it probably explains a lot. The lesson of the eminent economists that I mentioned are salient: cutting too deep and too fast risks causing fatal damage to the economy. The rush to slash the deficit and pay off the debt risks disadvantaging and disillusioning huge swathes of society across the UK and Scotland. I could pay off the mortgage on my house if I wanted to over five or seven years, but my children would have no shoes. The same aspect exists in a rush to cut and pay off the debt in the UK.

Every member across the chamber would echo the sentiment that the loss of young lives on our roads is a tragedy and something that we must do everything in our power to prevent. He spoke of the carnage on Highland roads. I come here as a North East Scotland member to say that the issue has been the cause of great concern in the Grampian area for a long time as well. Both the police and the fire service have done a great deal of work to try to educate young drivers&#8212;of which, more later.</p><p>I am generally supportive of the graduated licence scheme. There is a need to be cautious in viewing one particular solution as a panacea, but I do not think that David Stewart is doing that. The Government undertook a survey of young drivers through the form of a national young drivers debate in October 2010, which looked at, among other things, the graduated driving licence scheme. Interestingly enough, the young people themselves were not very keen on it, and we can probably understand why&#8212;the potential restrictions to their driving.</p><p>Over the summer, I attended an agricultural show and got talking to a driving instructor. He told me that he had discovered that fewer young people are putting themselves forward for pass plus than previously because they have found that insurance companies are no longer offering discounts to people who have pass plus because they do not see any differential in the accident rate between people who go through pass plus and people who do not. I do not know whether the statistics bear that out, but that is certainly what the insurance companies are saying. We have to ensure that we have the empirical evidence, and the study that David Stewart alluded to will certainly help to back up any argument.</p><p>The issue around the insurance companies and their attitude to pass plus demonstrates that the question is one of not just driver skill but driver behaviour and attitudes. In that regard, I note that David Stewart&#8217;s motion makes mention of the sensible driving, always arriving scheme, which I assume is similar to the safe drive, stay alive campaign that exists in Grampian and, I think, other areas. The campaign gives schoolchildren a fairly graphic presentation about what happens when a young person loses control of their car due to poor driver behaviour. That brings home to the young people exactly what the consequences of their actions can be. Victims of car accidents and parents who have lost their children speak to the young people and tell them about the consequences. The young people are often visibly moved during the presentations.</p><p>Presentations such as those have an important role to play alongside any measures that might be introduced. If we are going to tackle the issue, it is fine to do all we can to improve driving ability and perhaps remove night-time driving, but a reckless driver will be reckless during the daytime as well as at night, so we must ensure that the behavioural aspects are dealt with, too.</p><p>I noted with interest that young males are most likely to die on our roads as a driver but, crucially, young females are most likely to die as the passenger of a young male. David Stewart spoke about the restrictions on passengers, and that issue needs to be looked at. We may need not a restriction on passengers but a requirement for a responsible older person to be in the car for a period after a driver has passed their test, in the same way as someone who is learning to drive can go out in a vehicle only if they have somebody of a responsible nature over a certain age in the car with them.</p><p>I welcome the debate.

It was a thoughtful contribution and I am sure that there will be more like it. I welcome the cabinet secretary back to his position. The comments that were made across rural Scotland during the election campaign showed that he was the unequivocal choice of rural Scotland for the position, so it is great that he is back. I also welcome Stewart Stevenson to his new role, which sees his return to the ministerial team.</p><p>A number of members have commented on the wide range of the portfolio, and it is true that a number of different areas could be covered. I am not going to try to cover everything; I am going to look at a few key areas in which I have a particular interest. The first of those is resilience of rural communities&#8212;a point that I touched on in the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee this morning. Rural communities currently have a growing population and several rural local authorities are seeking to increase the housing in their areas through their structure plans. At the same time, some of those communities are suffering loss of services, whether through the loss of a post office or through the closure of a local bank branch or school. I therefore welcome the moratorium on rural school closures that was announced by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning.</p><p>Rural communities also find themselves struggling because of inequality of service. For example, if someone who lives in a rural community orders something online, they often have to pay a rural premium of &#163;15 or &#163;20 on top of the price of the product to have it delivered, even if they are located just a short distance from an urban area. Such things can cause great difficulties for our rural communities. The challenge is to ensure that we create vibrant communities in our rural areas and to make them not just places where people live but have to go elsewhere to access services. I welcome the cabinet secretary&#8217;s comments about the focus on community empowerment and the creation of more confident and vibrant communities.</p><p>In a previous speech in the chamber, I mentioned a community in the north-east that is set to benefit from its own renewables scheme. Udny is set to benefit from a community wind turbine to the tune of &#163;4&#160;million to &#163;5&#160;million over a 20-year period. Similar things are happening in other communities throughout rural Scotland, and we should try to encourage such developments to ensure that communities benefit and are empowered.</p><p>Another key area to focus on is food and drink. I very much welcome the additional funding that the cabinet secretary has announced today. Within the food and drink sector, we must ensure that retailers are not just selling Scottish products on their shelves but are actively promoting Scottish products as premium products. Beyond that, we should be guaranteeing a fair deal for producers. A commitment was given that an adjudicator would be introduced to look at the &#8220;Groceries Supply Code of Practice&#8221; and to ensure a fair deal for producers, but the UK Government has not yet honoured that commitment. We must keep the pressure on it to follow through on that commitment to ensure that producers are getting a fair deal. All too often, it is the producers who feel the pinch in terms of the prices that they are paid.</p><p>We should not be parochial when it comes to Scottish produce&#8212;we should not promote it just to Scottish people through retailers; we should also take up the international opportunities that exist to take Scotland the brand overseas and capture the market. There are a number of fine examples of Scottish companies in the food and drink sector that have captured a large slice of that international market. At a recent Scottish Enterprise briefing that I attended, Dean&#8217;s of Huntly was mentioned as an example. Dean&#8217;s has captured a significant contract in the United States, and it has recently been promoted in the Gulf, via Scottish Enterprise. I welcome the efforts that the cabinet secretary made in the previous session to reintroduce the haggis to the United States of America. I hope that he will find success in that regard.</p><p>Zero waste and landfill diversion are important not only from an environmental point of view, but from a financial point of view, particularly for local authorities, many of which face the prospect of significant increases in landfill tax burdens if they do not take urgent action to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfill. In Aberdeen, we have taken the decision to introduce the co-mingling of garden and food waste, so that people can now recycle their food waste with their garden waste as it is sent to be composted. That has significantly boosted recycling rates in Aberdeen and, crucially, it has reduced the amount of waste that is sent to landfill and the amount of rubbish that people put in their bins.</p><p>The variation in recycling across local authorities needs to be carefully considered&#8212;not just the recycling rate, but what can be recycled. There is often variation&#8212;even between neighbouring authorities&#8212;in what can be recycled by householders. To boost recycling rates, we need to find a way to allow neighbouring authorities to share recycling or to encourage other items to be recycled where there are opportunities to do so. I welcome the progress that was made during the previous session and I look forward to the progress that will be made this session. In particular, I look forward to what the Government will be introducing by way of proposed legislation.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22649004", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Rural Affairs and the Environment"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I congratulate my colleague David Torrance on his maiden speech.

Indeed, at yesterday&#8217;s meeting of the Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, we highlighted the roll-out of rural broadband as something that we want to focus on. It is great that the Government is investing via mechanisms such as the next generation digital fund, but we have to ensure that, following that investment and the establishment of the infrastructure, the service providers match that by providing services along those lines, and at a reasonable rate, so that people can afford to access services via broadband.</p><p>There has been some talk about television programmes&#8217; often UK-centric editorial positions&#8212;they do not always take account of the different flavours of devolution that exist in the UK. Ruth Davidson was perhaps a little too harsh on Joan McAlpine in relation to her suggestion that, all too often, the focus does not take account of Scotland. There can be no better example of that than that of our Deputy First Minister being chastised on &#8220;Question Time&#8221; for referring, in Glasgow, to a specific Scottish issue and being told that she should not do so because a wider UK audience was watching the debate. That happened even though, week after week, the programme features discussions on areas that are devolved to this Parliament, such as health, and speakers are at no point told that they should remember that there are viewers watching the programme in Scotland.</p><p>We have to ensure that, when editorial focus on Scotland is required, we can reflect that. We can do so through a Scottish digital network, which might enable more Scotland-focused political programming. That could be more accessible to the Scottish people on a regular basis, as opposed to the occasional arrival in Scotland of &#8220;Question Time&#8221; or other such UK programmes for a discussion of political events. I hope that that approach can be considered.</p><p>Local television output has been mentioned. As I am a north-east MSP, people might expect me to start banging the drum to bring back Grampian Television, but I will not do that at this stage. It is important to note that local television and radio have served as an important nurturing ground for future talent, which moves on elsewhere. For example, Isla Traquair started on Grampian Television and eventually moved to Channel 5, and I understand that Ruth Davidson made a transition from Kingdom FM to the Tory front bench. From such small acorns do large oaks grow.</p><p>It is important that we recognise that talent exists in Scotland, and we need to ensure that we develop and nurture that talent. There is talent not only in front of the camera or behind the microphone but in the back rooms, among the production staff, make-up artists, writers and so on. We have to try to create opportunities for Scottish talent to be retained&#8212;but not necessarily kept&#8212;in Scotland and at least to be given the opportunity to develop. The more opportunities that we can provide for young talented people to get into the industry and develop themselves at an early stage&#8212;and then look to move on elsewhere, if that is what they wish to do&#8212;the better.

This Parliament has form in coming together on a reserved issue, as we saw in the previous session with regard to the Moray air bases.

However, there is still deep concern over the changes to the supplementary charge and the ramifications for the industry. The decision to increase the supplementary charge from 20 to 32 per cent came as something of a bolt from the blue for the industry. There was no prior consultation or any indication that it was going to happen. Indeed, in the build-up to the budget, the industry received conciliatory noises from the Treasury that it would remain unaffected as a result of the budget process. That can lead one to assume only that it was a last-minute decision by the Treasury, rather than some sort of long-term plan. The very last thing that the energy and offshore oil industry needs is short-term, knee-jerk decision making, as opposed to long-term, strategic planning in consultation with the industry.</p><p>The decision has two impacts. There is a direct impact on the companies that are being taxed, and an impact through disincentivising investment. That affects not only new-field production, but those companies that specialise in extracting from the harder-to-reach and older fields. The higher rate of taxation applies to those older fields irrespective of whether the company is newly exploiting them or has been doing so for a long time.</p><p>There is also a secondary impact. Often, when the argument is taken to the public they will say, &#8220;Why should we feel sympathy for oil companies that are making large profits?&#8221; I understand their argument in some cases, but not every company that operates in the offshore sector is making large profits, as evidenced by the downturn in investment as a result of the decision. The secondary impact that we must bear in mind relates to the supply chain, which depends on investment in the oil industry.</p><p>There are a lot of small companies in the north-east of Scotland that depend on investment in the oil and gas sector for their future business. It is therefore just as important and imperative for those companies that the decision is re-examined as it is for the majors and the companies that operate offshore.</p><p>With that in mind, I welcome the approach that the Scottish Government has taken on the issue. There has been no foghorn diplomacy: a constructive approach has been taken, which is to be welcomed. The approach has been to offer alternatives to the Treasury with regard to how it could tax the offshore sector differently while increasing the confidence of the sector.</p><p>That confidence is important. Goldman Sachs published a document in May 2011 that provided insights into European oil and gas fiscal regimes. It said in its analysis that</p><p>&#8220;fiscal stability has been key to encourage exploration and innovation ... Low taxes clearly encourage activity: Our production forecasts in major new fields ... has increased 127% since 2006 in countries with a below-average tax rate vs. only 63% in above-average tax regimes. More tellingly, we have increased our forecast for countries with a stable or falling tax take by 150%, compared to a 19% fall in countries which have increased taxes over the same period.&#8221;</p><p>I do not oppose the concept of taxation on profit or, indeed, taxation on the sector; neither does the sector. The sector is asking for stability and consultation, neither of which demands is unreasonable. With that in mind, I brought this debate to the chamber.</p><p>When the United Kingdom Government looks at the submission from the Scottish Government&#8212;built on the work of Professor Alex Kemp and Linda Stephen in their paper that was produced in April 2011&#8212;I hope that it will conclude that what is required is a rethink on the issue. I hope that the UK Government will take another look at the taxation that is being levied on the industry and at the ways in which the Government can encourage and stimulate investment so that the potential for future jobs and economic benefits is not lost further down the line. More important, we do not want the many small businesses in the north-east that depend for continuing business on the oil industry and continuing investment in it to have to sit and worry about what will happen to them in three, four or five years&#8217; time.</p><p>I hope, perhaps forlornly, that we can get cross-party consensus on the issue. I will wait to see what the Conservative members say on the matter. They have not yet signed my motion, although they may have thought that a sort of bear trap was being set for them&#8212;I assure them that it was not. I would be more than happy if they changed their tone and signed the motion after the debate. I would welcome them with open arms.</p><p>I hope that we can build cross-party consensus on the issue and send the message that the oil and gas sector needs stability. I welcome very much the Government&#8217;s approach.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648956", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: North Sea Taxation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the members on all sides of the chamber who have signed the motion that I lodged.

Through my membership of Aberdeen City Council, I am the vice-convener of Grampian joint fire board&#8212;for the time being at least&#8212;and my brother-in-law is a retained firefighter and member of the Fire Brigades Union.</p><p>Alison McInnes mentioned police reform. It is unwise for the Liberal Democrats to continue to cast up that issue, especially given that the main plank of the Liberal Democrats 2011 election campaign in the north-east was to &#8220;save local policing&#8221; from the SNP. I remind Alison McInnes that every constituency in the north-east is now represented by an SNP MSP and that there are no Liberal Democrat constituency MSPs. Undeterred by that, the Liberal Democrats used that line again during the by-election in Dyce&#8212;the ward that I represent on Aberdeen City Council. The Liberal Democrats previously held the seat and this time they received a princely 11 per cent of the vote. I gently suggest to Alison McInnes that it might be time for the Liberal Democrats to get the message on police reform.</p><p>As a local councillor, I have spent a large amount of time with police officers on the beat in my ward, observing them and their work. It is phenomenally depressing to spend time on the beat with police officers during a weekend, because the majority, if not the entirety, of the work that they do in such a community is picking up drunk kids and returning them to their parents. It is unfortunate that so many young folk still find that the only acceptable thing for them to do of a weekend is to go out and get blootered.</p><p>I commend the work that the cabinet secretary and his department are doing, and will continue to do, to advocate the case for minimum pricing, because that undoubtedly will have an impact. Those kids are getting drunk not on premium-priced products but on ridiculously low-priced booze. Until we tackle that point, we will continue to have to pick up those young folk. In that regard, I sound a conciliatory note to the Liberal Democrats, who have got the message on minimum pricing. When Willie Rennie spoke in the chamber about leading his troops towards the sound of gunfire, I did not realise that that meant that he would take them on the road to Damascus. Nevertheless, they have got the message on minimum pricing and I warmly welcome that.</p><p>I also welcome the work that cashback for communities is doing across the north-east and, indeed, the rest of the nation. It is putting a large amount of money into diversionary activities and is supporting the work of a number of groups and organisations to harness and develop the potential of young people, rather than leave it to be squandered and wasted, as so often happened in our communities.</p><p>I will focus now on the fire service reforms, which have not been dealt with to any great extent so far. As I mentioned, I have served on Grampian joint fire board. There was a debate about the reforms that were to take place and although there was not unanimity on exactly what the outcome of the consultation should be, there was unanimity&#8212;we unanimously agreed our response to Government&#8212;on the fact that reform was needed, that the current system was not fit for purpose and that there was a need to look very carefully at what we do with our fire service.</p><p>In addition, it was clear that where local specialisms and centres of excellence exist, we need to look at whether those can be retained and worked into any reform that takes place. I highlight the urban search and rescue specialism that exists in Grampian. A team from Grampian that specialises in urban search and rescue was heavily involved in the relief efforts following the earthquake in New Zealand, and I put on record my commendation for its hard work in that situation.</p><p>I will deal briefly with the response of the Fire Brigades Union to the consultation, which&#8212;handily for today&#8217;s debate&#8212;appeared in my mail just this week. In response to question 10, which was</p><p>&#8220;which option do you think should be pursued and why?&#8221;,</p><p>the available answers to which were single service or regional structure, the FBU opted for single service. In doing so, it stated:</p><p>&#8220;In principle we could support both options with the correct governance and management structures, but this is subject to there being satisfactory arrangements on the areas highlighted above. We believe that both arrangements could deliver safe communities and fire service employment protection; provided there are clear and distinct responsibilities invested in the regional structures to deliver risk based emergency cover within each region, to an agreed and consistent National Standard. Of the two options, we consider that this would be easier to deliver within a single structure.&#8221;</p><p>I welcome the involvement of the FBU because its members are the people on the front line&#8212;they are the life savers. I do not believe for one second that those dedicated firefighters would support or endorse a proposal that would lead to risks to the public. Ultimately, people in our communities are less concerned about what the badge that their emergency service personnel wear says than about the fact that they are there, that they are visible and that they are working for them in their communities. That is my priority, I know that it is the priority of the cabinet secretary and the Government, and it should be a priority for us all.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Taking Scotland Forward: Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

I want to mention the Mrs V case because Dundee falls within my region, North East Scotland. My colleague Joe FitzPatrick rightly said in yesterday afternoon&#8217;s debate that it was a situation that should never have occurred and should never happen again. Every member would echo that.</p><p>With that in mind, I very much welcome the publication last year of the national dementia strategy, which addressed many of the points that that case raised, although the case took place a couple of years before the strategy was introduced. I know that many people working in the care sector as unpaid carers and indeed as professionals very much welcome the emphasis that is contained in the strategy.</p><p>Aberdeen City Council, on which I serve, has recognised the changing demography and the need to align budget provision accordingly. That is why, at its most recent budget meeting, the council took the decision to put an additional &#163;7&#160;million into the social care budget.</p><p>In future years, the council will focus on elderly care, because we recognise that pressures will come from that as a result of the demographic statistics, which Jackie Baillie and my colleague George Adam highlighted. The point of putting such money into social care services is to transform them early so that they are prepared not only for the demographic challenges but for the financial challenges that will follow. I am sure that members appreciate that what matters is not always the money that is put in but what the service that is in place delivers for people.</p><p>I invite members with a keen interest in the integration of health and social care to visit the Rosewell house care home in Aberdeen, which Aberdeen City Council and Grampian NHS Board operate and fund jointly. The home provides respite and rehabilitation beds and is an example of good practice in working together between the health board and the council. Perhaps that could be considered as a model for elsewhere in Scotland.</p><p>Several members have touched on unpaid carers, on which I will focus for the remainder of my speech. Next week is carers week, and it is important to recognise the invaluable role that carers play in society. I very much welcome the support for carers in Scotland that the Government, the cabinet secretary and her team have provided in recent times. Much carer support is being provided and that is very much welcomed.</p><p>I also welcome the sharing of personal experiences today by my colleague Fiona McLeod and by Mary Fee. That brings it home to us that, across the chamber, we have much personal as well as professional experience of the situations that are faced in our communities.</p><p>Fiona McLeod was right to highlight the iniquity of the carers allowance that Westminster provides. It is less than &#163;60 per week, and many carers who receive it do not have the benefit&#8212;which my mother has&#8212;of having a working partner who can support them beyond that &#163;60 per week. When James Purnell was the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my colleague Brian Adam wrote to ask him to look at the allowance with a view to uplifting it. Unfortunately, the response was that the carers allowance is not a wage. I do not dispute that but, to qualify for the allowance, a person&#8217;s working hours and the amount that they can earn per annum are restricted.</p><p>My mother cared for my grandfather when he was alive, so she cared for two elderly people. I know that a number of people care for multiple relatives rather than just one relative. However, such carers are eligible for only one carers allowance payment. With only that payment, it is difficult for many people who have no supplementary income from another family member to provide acceptable care and to deliver other services when caring for more than one relative.</p><p>As a Parliament and as the Government, we must lobby Westminster hard to ensure that the carers allowance does not become a Cinderella benefit that is left out of the overall welfare reforms that are being considered. I welcome the fact that the allowance is not being absorbed into the universal credit, but radical and urgent reform is needed to ensure that it provides the assistance that carers require it to provide. Unfortunately, carers in Scotland and across the UK ask for little, which is exactly what Westminster gives them.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648190", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Caring for Scotland&#8217;s Older People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by declaring a number of interests.

Having congratulated you privately on your elevation to the role, I do so publicly today.</p><p>Like Kezia Dugdale last week, Mark Griffin spoke today about his unexpected election to Parliament. I share that feeling, although they probably at least turned up to the count in appropriate attire. Nonetheless, I am delighted to be elected, and I am grateful to the 140,000 people who voted SNP in the list in North East Scotland and returned me as a list member.</p><p>Having been born in Inverurie, raised in Aberdeen and attended university in Dundee, I have spent my entire life in the North East region. It is a wonderful corner of the world, and it is a great honour and privilege to represent the area. I hope that I will do the people who sent me here justice by representing them to the best of my ability.</p><p>I welcome the inclusion of local ownership in the motion and in the Labour amendment. Sadly, it is missing from the Tory amendment, but then so is ambition. Sarah Boyack spoke about energy efficiency in relation to housing. My colleague Kevin Stewart rightly pointed out the success of Aberdeen Heat and Power. As a member of Aberdeen City Council, I had the privilege of opening two Tenants First Housing Co-operative properties that use a model of housing from Canada known as Super E housing, which is an extremely energy-efficient form of housing that significantly reduces household heating bills. I spoke to Alex Neil about that when he was the Minister for Housing and Communities, and I fully intend to raise with Keith Brown, the new Minister for Housing and Transport, the issue whether that housing model could be considered for future new build in the social and private sectors in Scotland.</p><p>On Tuesday, along with a number of other members, I attended a thought-provoking and robust discussion event that was organised by Friends of the Earth Scotland at the Holyrood hotel. At that event, I met two gentlemen from Udny Community Wind Turbine Company, Brian McDougall and Mike MacDonald. For those who are unfamiliar with the community of Udny, the parish of Udny lies 15 miles north-west of Aberdeen and consists mainly of the villages of Pitmedden and Udny Green and surrounding rural properties. It has a population of roughly 2,000.</p><p>In 2006, the idea of a wind turbine to provide a sustainable, long-term income for the community was promoted at a community council meeting and taken forward by a small group of individuals. They investigated and selected a site, and they engaged with the community, including the schools. The schools in the area were brought in to develop models for a &#8220;planning for real&#8221; event, and the enthusiasm of the community was captured&#8212;so much so that a ballot on whether to proceed with a community wind turbine showed 91 per cent support for the project.</p><p>The decision was made to sell the electricity generated by the turbine to the National Grid and to form a community trust company, which would disburse the funds generated by the sale. It is estimated that, over the next 20 years, the project could raise as much as &#163;4 million to &#163;5 million for that small community. That is a fantastic opportunity for the people of Udny, and I very much hope that they will realise it. The likelihood is that the turbine will go live later this month. It has required five years of hard work and dedication by the people of that community, and they deserve significant commendation for their work.</p><p>But&#8212;and there are always buts&#8212;there have been some concerns, not directly with the Scottish Government, necessarily, but in areas that we might need to raise with others if we are to encourage more communities to develop projects in the future and if we are to make it easier for them to do so.</p><p>The first of those areas is how communities deal with HM Revenue and Customs. A request was made by the community that I have highlighted&#8212;a fairly sensible request, I thought&#8212;to engage in monthly accounting, which would make things easier for the community in paying invoices and dealing with VAT. That request was refused, and the people were told that they had to proceed on a quarterly basis. I find that a little bit obstructive, and not in the spirit of encouraging such projects.</p><p>The second area involves lending. The loan that the community took out to develop the project comes from the Triodos Bank, in the Netherlands. There were only three banks that the community could look to for finance. One was the Clydesdale, which, unfortunately, was not able to take on the project at the time. The other was the Co-operative Bank, which was unable to do so either. The Triodos Bank, for which the community had nothing but the highest praise, took on the project. It would be beneficial, however, to retain the money within the Scottish economy. Perhaps the minister can see what he can do to encourage other banks to lend to such projects.</p><p>In 2006, the people of Udny showed vision and ambition. After five years of hard work and dedication, their community is set to reap significant rewards. In 2011, Scotland showed that it has vision and ambition by re-electing the SNP to government on the back of our ambitious targets for renewable energy generation. Let us all work together in the Parliament to ensure that, in five years&#8217; time, the people and communities of Scotland are the ones who reap the rewards.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22647891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

I echo the comments of other members who have commented on the high standard of speeches. I might not always agree with the content, but the standard of the speeches that have been given is exemplary.</p><p>I begin by referring to something that Dr Simpson said. He referred to curling, and I recommend that he visit the fantastic, state-of-the-art Curl Aberdeen facility. The European curling championships were recently hosted in Aberdeen, and compliments were given by competitors on the standard of the facility.</p><p>I must sound a slightly down note, however: on coming into power on Aberdeen City Council, the SNP had to invest &#163;1 million in the Linx ice arena in order to hold those championships and to bring the arena up to the required standard. That was due to an unfortunate legacy of neglect and underinvestment under previous Labour, Lib Dem and Tory administrations.</p><p>During the election campaign, I had the great privilege of visiting the Granite City amateur boxing club in Aberdeen, which is the home of the Aberdeen assassin, Lee McAllister, a world and Commonwealth boxing champion.</p><p>The club&#8217;s work in providing a focus for young people is excellent. It is about not only developing potentially elite athletes for the future but providing diversionary activity of the sort that members mentioned. Boxing is one of the sports that take children from poorer backgrounds, in particular, who might otherwise find themselves going down the wrong path, and help to give them a constructive outlet for their energies.</p><p>The club is searching for funding to try to develop new facilities so that it can encourage more female members to join the club, because there has been an uptake in interest in female boxing. I look forward to working with the club and other colleagues in the north-east to try to secure that funding.</p><p>I am pleased that the minister talked about action on youth football, which is close to my heart. Before I was elected, I worked as a football coach for a youth team in Aberdeen. When I intervened during Liz Smith&#8217;s speech, I mentioned the acute problem that there is in attracting new people to referee in football, because the problems that are often seen in the professional game put people off. I very much welcome the minister&#8217;s comments about looking at disciplinary structures at the SFA and the work in which the Scottish Government and the SFA have been engaged, which will help to remove some of the problems in getting people involved in refereeing.</p><p>Summer football needs to be considered in the context of how the youth game goes forward. The previous chief executive of the SFA, Gordon Smith, was keen on a shift to summer football in Scotland, as has happened in Ireland and many Scandinavian nations. Summer football has been piloted in the women&#8217;s game and should be looked at for the youth game. From my youth coaching experience, I can say that it is difficult to teach kids the basics of passing, moving and so on in December, January and February, when the weather is bad and pitches are of a poor standard and do not lend themselves to the development of key skills.</p><p>There is also a need to look at youth development by professional clubs. The Public Petitions Committee considered the issue during the previous session of the Parliament and the minister has taken an interest in the matter. I spoke recently to the president of Dyce Boys Club FC, where I used to coach, about a fact-finding mission to Sweden by one of the club&#8217;s coaches. The coach had looked at the system at IFK Gothenburg, where if a child joins at the age of 11 or 12 they are given a firm commitment and a guarantee that they will be at the club until they are 16.</p><p>For too many young players who go to professional clubs in Scotland, the guarantee lasts only until the next game. Very often, players are released mid season or at the end of the season. That is not always a problem in and of itself, given that we accept that football is a difficult profession in which to succeed; the problem is to do with getting a link back to the grass-roots club. If a player who has gone to a professional club is released, there needs to be some form of interaction between the professional club and the grass-roots level, to encourage the player back into the game at grass-roots level and get them picked up by another club. When clubs let players go, we must ensure that the players do not fall too far and land too hard.</p><p>There is hope for young players in the example of Paul Coutts. He did not initially make it as a professional but went to play in the Highland Football League, for Cove Rangers FC, in the south of Aberdeen. He was spotted by scouts from a number of English football clubs and was signed by Peterborough United FC&#8212;by Darren Ferguson, the son of Sir Alex. When Darren Ferguson became manager of Preston North End FC, he took Paul Coutts with him&#8212;Paul is still at Preston North End and has won a number of under-21 caps for Scotland. There is hope for a lot of young players who do not make the cut the first time round. They should not be afraid to go to the junior or Highland league clubs, because there are professional clubs out there who look at the young players in those leagues and try to get them back into the professional game.</p><p>I very much welcome the support that the Government has provided for grass-roots sport via the cashback for communities scheme and the young Scots fund. Let us rightly celebrate our top sportspeople, but let us also welcome the Government&#8217;s moves to invest in the development of the elite sportspeople through grass-roots sport.</p>", "hdate": "2011-06-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22648045", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sport"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Having made my maiden speech this morning, I begin this speech by congratulating my colleagues from across the chamber on making their maiden speeches this afternoon.
