There will be some who regard marriage as having a religious connotation that they do not choose to buy into.</p><p>The reality is that we do not know what the uptake of civil partnership by same-sex couples will be, nor do we know what appetite there might be among mixed-sex couples for civil partnership instead of marriage, although we know that there is some because a case has been taken to the European Court challenging UK civil partnership legislation. It has been recognised that an imbalance will arise, in that same-sex couples will be able to choose civil partnership, marriage or cohabitation, whereas mixed-sex couples will have only two of those options. If there were some challenge to that on human rights grounds, it might be hard to justify not allowing mixed-sex couples to have civil partnerships.</p><p>The Scottish and UK Governments have noted the position and have agreed to conduct civil partnership reviews. The Scottish Government published a remit for its review in September, but we do not know much more about the timescale for the review or the options that the Scottish Government is considering.

I hope that those people have come with us on society&#8217;s progress towards equality and are voting with the bill.</p><p>Civil partnership might not have been introduced as a separate institution had support for same-sex marriage existed a little over a decade ago. However, that is what happened. At the time, I proposed that if we were creating civil partnership, we should do so on a non-discriminatory basis and should allow mixed-sex couples as well as same-sex couples to have a civil partnership, should that be their preference. We did not do that, and the UK Parliament, when it legislated for the whole of the UK, gave us the system that we have now.</p><p>Jamie Hepburn quite rightly said that the situation calls into question the future of civil partnership, and I do not think that it gives an answer. As members have said, there is a question about whether civil partnership should continue under its current status, whether it should be removed&#8212;as the UK Government proposes&#8212;or whether people will simply opt for marriage and so there will be less take-up of civil partnership. We do not know the answer, which is why a review is necessary.</p><p>If Alex Johnstone had listened to Marco Biagi&#8217;s answer, it would be clear to him that it is only those mixed-sex couples&#8212;they are probably few in number&#8212;who would prefer civil partnership who face any argument of discrimination around what the law allows them to do. That is why a review is required. Both Governments agreed about that, and I am happy to see that a review will happen.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that, as Marco Biagi said, there will be an anomaly only if civil partnership continues for same-sex couples only. If it continues for everybody, we will have removed the discrimination. If it does not continue for everybody, we will have perhaps removed the discrimination in a less favourable way.</p><p>The cultural meanings of marriage and civil partnership are subjective. That is why the difference between them is subjective. It is not for us to decide whether some people should regard marriage as patriarchal or as having the sanctity of a religious contract, nor is it for us to decide whether people should regard civil partnership as a purely legal instrument or as a marker of discrimination. People reach such value judgments on their own terms.</p><p>Having said all that, I thank the cabinet secretary for his response. He has given some indication of the timescale. I am very pleased that he is talking about broadly two options, instead of the additional option that the UK Government has floated of forcing people to change their civil partnership into a marriage. I am happy that there has been a recognition of the status and the meaning of civil partnership as something distinct, and I am happy about the consensual basis on which the cabinet secretary intends to pursue those debates.</p><p>I am content with the cabinet secretary&#8217;s response.

I, for one, feel privileged to be a member of the Parliament and to have the opportunity to speak in the debate.</p><p>The comments that Marco Biagi read from some of his constituents put me in mind of how I might have felt had this legislation been passed in Scotland when I was coming out&#8212;or, more particularly, when I did not yet feel able to do so. The message that we send by passing the legislation will be extremely positive. The response of young people, some of whom are baffled that it is even an issue, will become the mainstream response. A few years down the line, a great many people in Scotland will wonder what all the fuss was about.</p><p>I pay credit to the Government, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and Nicola Sturgeon, who was the previous minister in charge of the bill, the committee and its previous members, and the many campaigners who have worked so hard on the issue. It has taken us a little bit longer than Westminster to get to this point but, partly because of the time spent and the committee&#8217;s amendments, we have a better bill as a result.</p><p>There has been a good degree of cross-party consensus, which speaks volumes. That was not always the case. From decriminalisation through to the equalisation of the age of consent, the introduction of anti-discrimination law, the repeal of section 2A, legislation on gender recognition and adoption and fostering, moves towards equal family law, and the introduction of civil partnerships and now equal marriage, we have heard the voices of dissent. I believe that they are diminishing in their number in society at large and in the substance of their arguments, although that persistent opposition remains.</p><p>I must say to Alex Johnstone in particular that those arguments have not always been expressed to me in the respectful tones that he described. A vociferous opposition to LGBT equality and human rights exists in our society. Those people have inherited the views of those who objected every step of the way, from decriminalisation onwards. Judging from the correspondence that I have received, some people simply seem baffled at the idea that same-sex relationships should be treated with respect or equality. Often the prejudice is couched in religious terms. I make the case that claiming religious justification for prejudice does not make that prejudice any less objectionable, although I endorse Kevin Stewart&#8217;s comments that, very often, the hierarchies that represent that prejudice do not necessarily represent the views of the people whom they claim to represent.</p><p>Many people perceive the bill principally in religious terms, but let us remember once again that most people who get married in Scotland choose not to involve religion in any way; indeed, most marriages are fully secular. It is important to assert that religious freedom includes not only freedom of religion but freedom from religion. Those are both important aspects of religious freedom. I have yet to hear&#8212;in this debate or in any other so far&#8212;any clear, coherent moral argument that same-sex relationships are in any way inferior or less worthy of respect and equal status.</p><p>Now that the bill is on the verge of being passed, it is important that we look beyond our current situation and beyond Scotland to countries where the fight for equality and LGBT human rights is not about pensions and inheritance, but is still about life and death. In some of those places, some strands of organised religion and their hierarchies continue to offer the single most consistent source of hostility to LGBT people&#8217;s dignity, rights, equality, wellbeing and safety.</p><p>As we welcome to Glasgow some of those countries where people are struggling with that question of life and death on LGBT equality, we should take pride in telling the story of Scotland&#8217;s progress from being a country that felt unable to decriminalise homosexuality at the same time as the rest of the UK and in which, in Glasgow and Edinburgh, people felt that it was not yet safe to have a pride march&#8212;we could not do that here&#8212;to being this country, which is proud to pass equal marriage legislation for this generation and for the future.</p>", "hdate": "2014-02-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22879990", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was not really expecting to hear about chicken farming, Tannadice or &#8220;South Pacific&#8221;&#8212;well, perhaps I was expecting to hear about &#8220;South Pacific&#8221;&#8212;but we have heard some cracking good speeches.

We have heard some of that argument today. However, when most budgets are looked at impartially, the reality is that most people can find measures that they welcome and measures that they feel the need to challenge.</p><p>All Opposition parties&#8212;including the SNP when it enjoyed the somewhat limited privilege of being in opposition&#8212;look at budgets and decide where they need to challenge and oppose the Government, where they need to encourage the Government to go a bit further, and where they need to offer constructive suggestions. Only once we see how the Government responds to all the debate can Opposition parties decide whether, on balance, a budget is worth supporting or needs to be opposed. I can find in the current budget examples of measures in all the categories that I described.</p><p>Several members have mentioned GDP. I know that the Scottish Government is interested in&#8212;but needs encouragement to go further on&#8212;reducing its reliance on GDP and designing economic policies that balance properly economic, environmental and social priorities.</p><p>I know that the Scottish Government wants to go further on climate change; it recognises the urgency of that challenge, but it is not yet providing budgets that genuinely offer a turnaround and the ability for us to start meeting the world-leading targets that we all agreed to.</p><p>I know that the Scottish Government would like to do more on active travel and cutting energy consumption, but goodness knows that it has needed more encouragement on that.</p><p>There are aspects of the budget that I feel the need to criticise and to oppose, but on which I know the Government is not likely to give ground. For example, we have repeatedly criticised the unsustainable transport projects that the Government has pushed through with the support of most Opposition parties. There has been a shift from revenue to capital over the past few years, and much of that money is going to fund transport projects that we do not support. A consequence of the shift from revenue to capital is that there is less money for the likes of public sector pay; if we were not making that shift we would be able at least to match inflation in public sector pay.</p><p>As for the council tax freeze and the small business bonus scheme, those are untargeted measures. There would be far better ways of using the resources to achieve social, economic and environmental objectives, if we cared to balance those issues.</p><p>On the cuts to colleges and to housing, in particular, over the past few years, the Government needs to be challenged.</p><p>However, there is much to welcome in the budget. The finance secretary talked about the concept of the social wage. Under that broad heading are many policies that the Greens have been happy to welcome. The recent announcements on childcare and free school meals are important steps in the right direction, and I commend the cabinet secretary for them. He could do more, and he should&#8212;if he is able&#8212;meet colleagues from other parties to discuss the bedroom tax. Solutions might not be easy or straightforward, but if the cabinet secretary and his colleagues bring their undoubted creativity to the challenge, they might find a solution. If they can do that, they will add to the Government&#8217;s credibility on the concept of the social wage.</p><p>As I said in a Finance Committee debate before the recess, the Government&#8217;s thematic change funds represent a constructive approach, which we think could be taken further in relation to public health and active lifestyles. We have put to the cabinet secretary a proposal for a healthy challenge fund, which is modelled on the climate challenge fund. The cabinet secretary agreed to the climate challenge fund in a previous budget negotiation some years ago, and he has continued the policy year on year&#8212;although he no longer needed Green votes in budget debates and could have got rid of it&#8212;because he has recognised that empowering communities to put in place their own solutions can often lead to an approach that is far more creative than a top-down solution would be.</p><p>On issues such as healthy and active lifestyles, active travel and an active, healthy approach to food, which includes local growing schemes, there is a great deal that we could achieve that would bring social, economic and environmental benefits. By empowering communities to put solutions in place through a healthy challenge fund, the Scottish Government could achieve a great deal more than it achieves through its existing activity under such headings.</p><p>I encourage the cabinet secretary to give serious consideration to those ideas and to other ideas that have been proposed across Parliament today. If he does so and is willing to make concessions in many of those areas, I think that he will end up with a better budget, for which he will secure the broadest support.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22858354", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 3) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Governments and&#8212;more frequently&#8212;Government party back benchers like to suggest that a vote on a budget is either an endorsement of every detail or an absolute rejection of everything.

That is true in relation to public perception, media coverage, political debate and institutional knowledge. To be fair, it is even true in relation to the environment movement and the issues that people campaign on.</p><p>Although I am sure that all the contributors to the debate understand the difference between climate and weather, when we see&#8212;either at first hand or on our television screens&#8212;images depicting the impact of extreme weather events, flooding, wind and rain, drought and heat wave, and when we experience those things in our lives, it is an opportunity to consider both sides of the coin: adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>There is some overlap between the two. Changing land use patterns are raised by both agendas. There is overlap in issues of infrastructure and a just transition. That particularly applies to Scotland, where, as the minister said, a great deal of our economy is reliant on issues to do with land use, whether that is agriculture for domestic consumption or export, tourism or other uses.</p><p>I would echo some of the points have been made, such as Sarah Boyack&#8217;s argument on the need to consider flood management in every single planning decision that is made, or Alex Fergusson&#8217;s argument that a longer-term approach needs to be taken to these issues rather than just a five-year cycle. I think that the latter point was echoed in Scottish Environment LINK&#8217;s briefing to members.</p><p>The area that I want to focus on is one in which I feel that more work needs to be done. It was not until page 53 of the draft programme that we started to hear about the impact that climate change will have on the wider world and Scotland&#8217;s need to adapt to that. Scotland adapting to climate change is not just about adapting to the extreme weather impacts that climate change will bring in Scotland; it is about adapting to a wider world.</p><p>On page 53, the draft programme says:</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish economy may be affected by the impacts of climate change overseas. These effects may be considerable, and possibly larger than the immediate impacts of climate change in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>It does not unpack that argument and the range of scenarios that we may encounter in any great detail. I can see very little in the list of actions that relate to that. The programme goes on to say:</p><p>&#8220;At a global scale, the impacts of climate change could also lead to restrictions on food supply&#8212;leading to higher prices and lower availability in Scotland. This would exacerbate food-related health and social inequalities in Scotland.&#8221;</p><p>That is true, but it is only really the beginning of an attempt to engage with that argument.</p><p>In continuing to develop the strategy, and as it moves from a draft into a final document, I would strongly encourage the Government to do more work on that aspect. We are living in such a globalised world that there is no one in this room who cannot immediately lay their hands on products that arrived on these shores in a shipping container. If the projections about sea level rise that we are hearing come true, every piece of port infrastructure in this globalised world is at risk.</p><p>What happens when that infrastructure starts to fail? What happens to crops in a globalised world? We have seen in the recent meat crisis just how complex and convoluted our food supply chains are. What happens when crops fail in developing countries? What happens when Governments fail and when conflict arises over access to land and water? What happens when populations migrate? I urge the Government to give greater consideration not just to the adaptation that Scotland needs to make to changing weather patterns at home but to our adaptation to a changing global climate, economically as well as in absolute climate change terms.</p>", "hdate": "2014-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22838948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Climate Change Adaptation Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is probably fair to say that climate change adaptation often plays second fiddle to the mitigation agenda and the urgent need to reduce our emissions.

Mr Swinney was right to be a wee bit tentative in acknowledging signs of economic progress. I think that he referred to stable, if not uniform, progress. However, he immediately started to define progress in terms of GDP growth only. In discussing employment, he focused on overall numbers and not on the nature of employment or issues such as low pay. In talking about the economy&#8217;s strength, he saw it purely in output terms.</p><p>The problems that Greens see with that economic mindset, which relates to what I call the outgoing economic model, cannot all be fairly laid solely at Mr Swinney&#8217;s door. We find little to disagree with in most of his motion and I suspect that he is interested in and at least sympathetic to some of our arguments. However, he continues to define economic success in the terms that are laid down by the economic model that has failed us. Like those in most other political parties, he seems to think that recovery means getting back to business as usual. We have much in common, but we part company as soon as the debate becomes a sterile contest about which Government can more convincingly claim the credit for the most recent GDP figures.</p><p>As for the Labour Party&#8217;s contribution, Mr Gray recognised aspects of the employment picture that need to be acknowledged, such as underemployment, low pay, zero-hours contracts and insecure conditions, with people facing rising living costs at the same time. He made the case, with which I agree, that a devolved Government&#8217;s hands are not fully tied on those matters. I agree with his example of public contracts, and I will support amendments to the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Bill in that regard.</p><p>I also agree that, instead of a simplistic and untargeted small business bonus, we could design a business rates scheme that genuinely incentivises ethical practices in business, investment in quality new jobs and local, sustainable and resilient economies. The same case could be made in relation to corporate welfare payments&#8212;the Government grants that are too often paid to the likes of Amazon instead of indigenous small businesses, as my colleague Alison Johnstone noted.</p><p>We have common ground with Mr Gray on many of those issues, but the rest of his remarks were limited to a simplistic attack on independence. He is perfectly entitled to make that case, and I have no doubt that he does so with sincerity, but I hoped for some unpacking of the comments in his amendment about new powers to achieve some of the things that we want to achieve. I hoped that we would hear more about that after yesterday&#8217;s debate. I am not open to the jam tomorrow argument, but many people want to know. It is clear that Malcolm Chisholm wants to know; in yesterday&#8217;s debate, he talked about the economic advantages from more fiscal devolution, even if it just means all income tax staying in Scotland. It is clear that there is an appetite for more, even in the Labour Party, but we heard nothing of that today.</p><p>The Tory and Lib Dem speeches focused on the shallow argument about whether the UK or Scottish Government can claim the credit for the least impressive recovery from a recession in living memory. Those parties would like Mr Osborne to be hailed for that great achievement. All the while, he plans to raid billions more from the pockets of society&#8217;s poorest people. The agenda of the UK Government is clear&#8212;to it, austerity is not a necessary evil but the new normal, which involves an ever-smaller public sector and an ever-more denuded welfare state. Those who believe in that agenda should be honest about it and those who claim to oppose it should give up the ministerial cars and join those who seek to bring down that Government as soon as possible.</p><p>What was missing from the other parties&#8217; contributions is provided by the Green amendment and was articulated by Alison Johnstone. It is a new, sustainable and democratically accountable economic model, in which we challenge the myopic obsession with GDP at any cost; invest in public services, which we all depend on; and protect small businesses and local economies from the domination of vast multinationals, whether they are in banking, retail, energy or any other sector.</p><p>Willie Rennie asked me to accept that a whole new level of uncertainty comes with independence. Few people in the chamber might be open to persuasion on either side of the debate, but I make the case that independence creates a whole new level of possibility&#8212;not the guarantee of the more radical agenda that I am suggesting, but merely the possibility. I contrast that with a whole new level of certainty in a status quo that it is time to reject.

I express my dismay that one member has chosen to describe the reaction against this despicable campaign as &#8220;synthetic&#8221;. It is very clear that the reaction comprised very genuine and sincerely felt anger, disgust and dismay at the nature of the campaign.</p><p>There is, of course, a distinction between the mechanisms of asylum and immigration, but there is an overlap in the way that those issues are politically debated. Why is that? It is because among the most powerful forces in both debates are racism and xenophobia, and the way in which those forces are manipulated and whipped up by certain elements of our political culture and media in the UK. We need to recognise that. I will concentrate my remarks on the asylum system, because of the particular viciousness of the use in Brand Street of images of homelessness to intimidate asylum applicants and their families.</p><p>We need to address what the asylum system is for, because that is what is challenged by this campaign and the years of policy that preceded it under the current and previous UK Governments. An asylum system should be founded on compassion. Its purpose should be to give asylum to those who need it, not to refuse it to everyone for whom an excuse can be found to give a refusal. The latter, I am afraid, is what we have in this country. We have an asylum system that has morphed into what is little better than a human stock-taking exercise, in which individuals who work in the system are under constant pressure to say no at every opportunity and in which applicants are forced to get over absurd hurdles. There are barriers to justice that a Scottish person&#8212;a UK citizen&#8212;who sought justice in our courts would never have to experience, such as issues around stress, translation and representation. There are things to which they should have access but to which they do not, which creates a lack of justice in the system.</p><p>There should be justice as well as compassion for the same reason that we say in our criminal courts that it is better that a guilty person occasionally goes free than that innocent people be convicted. On the same principle, it is better that some people who might not have a well-founded claim end up being given leave to remain than that people who face genuine fear of persecution be sent back to face it.</p><p>If we rebalanced that, we would have an asylum system that was based on compassion and justice rather than one that is based on shallow, self-defeating principles, which those who whip up racism and xenophobia in the debate have managed to achieve. I repeat that they have managed to achieve that. Let us acknowledge what has been done to the asylum system over the years.</p><p>The images of homelessness that are being used to intimidate applicants are vicious not only because they cause fear or are distressing but because they recall the fact that destitution&#8212;the reality of destitution, not just the image of it&#8212;has been a deliberate act of asylum policy in the UK for years. Those images are so capable of causing fear because the reality exists on our streets. It has existed for years and will exist this Christmas as it has done for Christmases past.</p><p>Whether in the context of the UK or, perhaps more easily, a Scottish asylum system, that must be reversed. Years of racism and xenophobia in the asylum system must come to an end.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22819985", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Home Office Go Home Campaign"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I express my thanks to Jackie Baillie for bringing to the chamber her motion for debate.

Members of the Scottish Green Party have probably been boring members over the years with speeches about why it is important to move away from narrow metrics such as GDP growth and have a broader understanding of the economic health of our society. We need broader metrics such as the humankind index that Linda Fabiani mentioned. However, members do not have to be Greens&#8212;they do not have to take the position that says that everlasting economic growth is impossible on a planet of finite resources and that the everlasting pursuit of it will be destructive&#8212;to recognise the reality.</p><p>The lesson of history is that there have been long periods in which our country has experienced continual economic growth and the lion&#8217;s share of the economic benefit of that activity has been hoarded by those who are already wealthiest&#8212;those who need the resources least benefit the most. Very often, that activity happens at the expense and exploitation of people and the environment. Very often, it means the exploitation of the environments in which the most exploited people live. Members do not have to be Greens to recognise that lesson of history.</p><p>The cabinet secretary is to be congratulated on his approach in developing the national performance framework and his desire for cross-party dialogue on its future development. However, Malcolm Chisholm was also right to say that some of those congratulations have been qualified. I think that the cabinet secretary would recognise that it is the beginning of a journey. He does not have all the answers yet on the future development of the concept and, although Scotland may be ahead of the curve in relation to the rest of the world, it is not a steep curve that we are ahead of&#8212;very few countries are doing anything at all in the area&#8212;so let us welcome the work that is being done but not rest on our laurels.</p><p>On climate change, I welcome many of the points that Rob Gibson made. I also welcome the fact that the Finance Committee included a quotation from the Minister for Environment and Climate Change, Mr Wheelhouse, who acknowledged that, although we are nearly five years on from passing the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, we are yet to achieve a single annual target and that renewed effort is needed to meet the statutory climate change targets.</p><p>I make a plea to the cabinet secretary to make this the last year in which the climate change figures that accompany the budget come in right at the end of the committee scrutiny process and&#8212;in future years&#8212;to give those figures to the committees early enough to allow us to carry out robust and fair scrutiny. I hope that the Government would welcome that.</p><p>Among the areas in which we clearly need to do better as regards social justice and achieving the climate change targets are active travel and the energy efficiency programme. Mention has been made of taking money from energy efficiency to pay for bedroom tax mitigation, and I have a concern that, in doing that, we are, essentially, taking money from the pockets and purses of the very people whom we are trying to help, particularly in a year in which Barnett consequentials are available to use and in which money is being moved from revenue into capital. Those are potential alternative sources of funding that could be used to meet the equally important need of mitigating the bedroom tax.</p><p>On active travel, I commend the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition&#8217;s call for a doubling of the spend on the cycling budget. On paper, active travel&#8212;walking and cycling&#8212;is at the top of a hierarchy of transport priorities but, in reality, it is right at the bottom of the spend. The Government has increased spending on it a little this year, but the funding that is being provided is still way short of what is necessary for us to be able to meet the Government&#8217;s priority of 10 per cent of journeys being made by bike by 2020. Let us see a bit more focus on that.</p><p>On the wider health impact of active travel, there is a real opportunity to complement the Government&#8217;s approach on preventative spend through initiatives such as the change funds by building one around active lifestyles, healthy choices and healthy behaviour. At the moment, the Government has the community food and health (Scotland) project, which has just been brought under the auspices of NHS Health Scotland, but it has a tiny budget of around &#163;60,000 a year. Demand massively outstrips supply, and I suspect that demand would be a great deal higher if many people had heard of the initiative.</p><p>Another Scottish Government minister, Shona Robison, has previously told us that obesity currently costs Scotland &#163;457&#160;million a year and that that figure could increase to up to &#163;3&#160;billion a year if we do not get a grip of the issue. If the Government were to take the same change fund approach to healthy and active lifestyles and to healthy food, that would be a useful way of complementing its approach to preventative spend in a way that would meet social and environmental objectives. I hope that the cabinet secretary will be willing to discuss that with me over the coming weeks and months as we move forward in the budget process.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22820014", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Draft Budget 2014-15"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I extend my thanks to the Finance Committee for its work in producing the report and bringing it to the chamber.

There have been more victories than defeats as humanity continues to battle this epidemic, but both are still with us.</p><p>As a youth worker for an HIV agency in what is long enough ago to feel almost like a past life, I saw those victories and defeats on a small scale. It felt fantastic to see a young person who just a few months previously had been nervous, unsure of themselves and without the knowledge and skills to begin to think about how HIV would affect their lives progress to becoming a young, confident person finding their own voice and the opportunity to challenge ignorance and prejudice and to empower others to take the same attitude to HIV. On the other hand, when we hear a 17-year-old quietly and privately confiding that he has just had an HIV diagnosis, it is hard not to feel it as a bitter defeat; to be honest, it is hard not to beat ourselves up and feel responsible for it.

The Terrence Higgins Trust recently published the results of its survey of HIV-positive people, who talked about the misconceptions, the myths and the ignorance that they encounter every day. The most common was that HIV and AIDS are the same thing; that an HIV diagnosis is a death sentence; that someone with HIV cannot access financial products such as mortgages or life insurance; or that they cannot or should not have a relationship with someone who is not HIV-positive.</p><p>There is also the increasing myth that there is a cure or vaccine for HIV. As our victories continue to mount up globally and as we get closer to universal access to antiretroviral therapy around the world, preventing the idea that HIV has been solved from lodging in the minds of each new generation in particular will be an increasing challenge. If access to antiretroviral therapy becomes universal&#8212;which is, I am sure, something on which all of us want progress to be made as quickly as possible&#8212;we must avoid the danger of creating a perception among young people that HIV is not a problem any more.

I say that in relation to both opening speeches. Housing is an important issue and I congratulate the Labour Party on, and thank it for, bringing the debate to the chamber, but I feel strongly that turning the debate into yet another tiresome spat between Labour and the SNP is not going to help anyone.</p><p>There is an argument to be made about the number of homes that are being built. I say to the Government that it is important to recognise that the social rented sector is about more than simply council house builds, on which it is proud of its figures. We need to look at the numbers in relation to need and not only, as the Government&#8217;s amendment does, in relation to the Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition&#8217;s record or what is happening in other parts of the UK. We need to look at supply in relation to need.</p><p>We should acknowledge, as I think the Labour motion might, that the Scottish Government cannot simply wish away the context of ill-conceived and socially damaging cuts from the UK Government. We should also acknowledge the statement in the briefing from the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations that</p><p>&#8220;getting the affordable housing supply programme back on track is no easy matter and not helped by the difficulties in raising private finance to complement the subsidy levels.&#8221;</p><p>No Scottish Government of any political persuasion would find this an easy area to deal with at present.</p><p>If there is a housing crisis, we also need to recognise that it is not entirely about people not having adequate and suitable accommodation available to them. My amendment leaves in the Labour Party&#8217;s comments about temporary accommodation because they are important, but there are many people who have suitable accommodation for whom that accommodation is becoming increasingly unaffordable. As my amendment does, I want to focus on the private rented sector, which has doubled in size in 10 years, or thereabouts, and is continuing to grow ever more expensive. The figures in the Citylets report show year-on-year rental increases in Glasgow and Edinburgh of 5, 6 or 7 per cent or more in some areas&#8212;and that at a time when incomes are static or falling for far too many people.</p><p>To rent in the private rented sector is a choice for some and we should acknowledge that there is nothing second class about renting instead of owning a property. It is a choice for some and we should respect that, but for many other people it is not a choice&#8212;it is the only housing that is available to them. Trapped between unavailable social rent and unattainable owner occupation, and with the increase in single-person households that has already been mentioned, many people are finding that the private rented sector is their only option.</p><p>If we recognise that private renting is no longer simply a free choice in a marketplace but the only housing that our society is providing for many people, I believe that the case becomes clear for regulating the private rented sector as social provision.</p><p>There are good and bad landlords. Members will recognise that from dealing with their constituency case loads over the years. There are also good and bad letting agents. There are certainly those who regard properties simply as investments and not as homes. The imperative is for homes to provide housing for people, rather than income for landlords who do not wish to provide a quality service in exchange. A colleague has mentioned the example of a constituent who was threatened with notice to quit, against which so many private tenants have no defence, simply for seeking private rented housing panel mediation in relation to a dispute over the heating system in the home. The landlord was unwilling to provide the appropriate remediation that was necessary. The tenant simply sought mediation and was threatened with notice to quit.</p><p>Constituents have contacted me&#8212;this will be a familiar story to many members from around the country&#8212;about repairs that have been outstanding for years in some cases. Landlords have passed them from pillar to post and have simply not resolved vital problems that affect the liveability of that housing&#8212;which, I say again, is the only housing that is available to many people.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s Housing (Scotland) Bill includes measures that I welcome, such as the abolition of the right to buy and the regulation of letting agents. However, although such steps are positive, I encourage the Government to consider other options such as those relating to the provision of feedback on landlords. Many people who are looking for a property can go online and find out whether their landlord is registered but they get little more information than that, and a mechanism that allowed tenants to provide feedback on the quality of service from a landlord or letting agent would give people the information that they need to sort the good landlords from the bad ones who are out there. We also need more measures on security of tenure and energy performance standards in the private rented sector.</p><p>Finally, I want to make a case for the reintroduction of something that some European countries never abolished in the first place: some level of rent control.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22784886", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate, though I feel that I must apologise to members, as I seem to have arrived in the chamber with a speech that has nothing to say about independence&#8212;I hope that it will be acceptable if I give a speech that is only about housing.

Those issues are crucial, but they are not everything.</p><p>Alex Johnstone told us that supply overall has fallen by more than half and he laid the blame for that at the door of budget cuts. He may well be right, but it is pretty breathtaking to hear that from a supporter of the UK Government&#8217;s austerity programme. Cuts are not coming by magic; they are coming because of deliberate political choices.</p><p>The minister made much of the fact that other political parties did not offer numerical targets for new build social housing in their 2011 election manifestos. However, one political party not only committed to reversing the cuts to the housing budget but showed how it could be done&#8212;and it was not the Scottish National Party.</p><p>Maureen Watt&#8217;s contribution suffered from a little hint of tribal aggression here or there, but she was the first member to mention bank lending, which is important. To try to understand the housing market problems that we face without addressing bank lending to developers and the mortgage market is pretty meaningless. We are cursed with the dominance of a tiny number of vast megabanks instead of the diverse network of local smaller banks that we see in countries including Germany, which has not had the same problems as our banking system has had with lending into the real economy.</p><p>John Wilson devoted some of his remarks to the welfare reform agenda. It is meaningless to discuss housing without looking at the context of incomes. That means considering welfare and acknowledging the context in which many private sector employees experience the poverty pay that many private sector employers provide, and in which public sector workers continue to see real-terms pay cuts year after year.</p><p>Those issues directly connect to the housing problems that we need to address. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I believe that we can put more measures into the Housing (Scotland) Bill to address the affordability issues that many people face, in particular in the private rented sector.</p><p>I mentioned to Richard Baker rents in Aberdeen of &#163;800 to &#163;900. In Glasgow and Edinburgh there are pockets where there are similar rent levels. That is certainly not because the mortgage holders of those properties are paying very high mortgages; it is because of excessive profiteering. Rent controls have a role to play.</p><p>Energy performance standards have a role, as well. We can make a clear requirement for landlords and letting agents to bring their properties up to a decent energy performance standard before they put them on the private rented market, which would ensure that the people who live in those homes find them affordable to live in. Many people are living with extraordinary increases in energy costs.</p><p>There is an opportunity to address eviction and harassment. A relatively small number of people experience illegal eviction and harassment, but for them it is a profound challenge to their ability to live a decent life. Local authorities could be given a duty to investigate unlawful evictions and harassment and the power and resources to take cases directly to the courts.</p><p>I will seek and even hold out a little hope for a little cross-party support when I bring those measures for debate on the Housing (Scotland) Bill. There is an opportunity&#8212;at least once in a while&#8212;to put the independence issue to the side. We will have plenty of opportunities over the next 10 months to debate independence, but when we talk about the Housing (Scotland) Bill and the measures that we need to put in place to address the needs that exist in society we should put it aside&#8212;just for a wee while.</p>", "hdate": "2013-12-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22784886", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That point is well made.

I hope that we all aspire to that.</p><p>In reality, most people&#8212;including many on the no side&#8212;will find things in the white paper that they can agree with as well as things that they disagree with. As a supporter of a yes vote, I can find things in it that I strongly agree with and things that I disagree with. If I had in my other hand the no campaign&#8217;s prospectus for staying in the union, I would be able to compare and contrast the documents, but I have nothing in that hand. Actually, that is not quite right; I now have in it the better together campaign&#8217;s little newsletter, which was, I think, published on the same day. It has given me a very nice crossword and a recipe for raspberry brownies. At least the better together campaign is not telling us that there will be no raspberry brownies in an independent Scotland. I might give the recipe a try.</p><p>My party is very comfortable in encompassing all shades of opinion in the debate. We have had a clear majority in favour of Scottish independence for longer than I have been a party member, but we have entirely failed to fall out about the matter because we are defined by a different agenda. All of us, whatever our opinion on the independence question, want to use the debate to ask the fundamental question: what kind of society do we want to live in? If both sides could manage the debate at that level, Scotland would be in a much better position to move forward, whatever result the Scottish people choose.</p><p>I feel passionately enthusiastic about many of the principles that the Scottish Government has set out in its white paper, such as the principles on welfare, including childcare, whatever people think that we should or could do about that under devolution. The principles that the Scottish Government has set out on welfare are extremely impressive and go a huge distance towards challenging the Westminster welfare agenda. However, there should be greater recognition of unpaid economic activity as part of the welfare system. I see that Jim Eadie will shortly host a discussion on the citizens income. Some of that agenda will be spelled out in that discussion, I think.</p><p>There is a humane and compassionate approach to asylum and immigration, and a commitment to the removal of Trident. The Scottish Government needs to firm up its language on the timescale of that commitment and rule out any possibility that it will allow nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered vessels from other countries to operate in Scottish waters.</p><p>The desire to offer global leadership on climate change is fundamentally important. We can do that with credibility only if we act more radically and urgently to meet our domestic commitments.</p><p>There are also areas on which I will offer an alternative viewpoint. Gavin Brown called for someone to talk about an alternative currency agenda. I think that he knows that many us accept the possibility that continued use of the pound might be a reasonable transition step, but we see it as a transition to deeper independence. In response to Gavin Brown&#8217;s question about the Bank of England and the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposition, we must remember that the whole UK nationalised the Bank of England, that the whole of the UK&#8217;s resources went into that act and that the whole UK owns the Bank of England. Anyone who suggests that the UK Government and even Scottish representatives in the UK Government parties should oppose the Scottish Government&#8217;s proposed plan need to answer this question: why is it that Scotland would not be entitled to a share of shared assets?</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22765431", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Independence White Paper"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take the point.

I also thank several of the speakers who have given a very personal take on the issue&#8212;Kevin Stewart, Marco Biagi and, in particular, Ruth Davidson. In 10 years as a member of the Parliament, I have never so enthusiastically applauded a Conservative speech. I am always open to a new experience, of course.</p><p>Members might be a little surprised that my personal circumstances place me in what I regard as impeccably neutral territory on the issue: I am single, I am bisexual, I have no idea whether I will have a long-term relationship with a man or a woman in future and I have no idea whether I would want to get married. Certainly, I do not personally regard marriage as a gold standard; I regard it as one of the many options on family status that people will make a choice between on the basis of their values and not the values that we would impose on them.</p><p>The arguments that we have heard against the bill have been many and varied. Some have been frankly spurious and silly, such as the one that goes, &#8220;Well, you know, you can get married already, just to somebody of the opposite sex.&#8221; I cannot believe how frequently I have heard that nonsensical and demeaning argument.</p><p>Some arguments have been mischievous. There have been deliberate attempts to whip up ungrounded fears about ministers in the Church of Scotland being dragged off by the police, taken to the courts and prosecuted for refusing to marry same-sex couples.</p><p>Some of the arguments against the legislation have simply been curious, such as the view that, from the starting point of religious freedom, the law ought to tell churches who they may not be allowed to marry. It seems to me that the argument for religious freedom must be in favour of what the Government is trying to achieve with the bill, which is to permit but not compel.</p><p>Some arguments against the legislation are serious and we should not ignore them&#8212;quite the contrary. There has been serious opposition to pretty much every step that has been taken in the equalities story over many generations. Certain voices have opposed every step towards LGBT equality, from decriminalisation onwards. Those serious arguments absolutely must not be ignored but must be confronted and defeated because they assert, whether in religious or other terms, the lesser worth, dignity, status or value of LGBT people and our relationships. Those arguments should and deserve to be defeated. In more than 20 years of volunteering, working or campaigning on many of those issues, I have in all honesty never heard a coherent moral argument in favour of the view that same-sex relationships are of lesser worth or status or that they are morally wrong. I have heard many such arguments rooted in homophobia but none in a coherent moral case.</p><p>Some of the arguments that I have heard fall under the heading &#8220;I&#8217;m not homophobic, but&#8221;. That amounts to someone saying that they are not homophobic but they are concerned that one day they might need to treat LGBT people as though they were their equals. On that basis, we have heard demands for so-called protections to be built into the legislation&#8212;protections from the indignity of having to treat other people as equals. If we look at the evidence that we heard on the call for those protections, were we to give into the demands, that would amount to a rolling back of 10 or 15 years of legislative and cultural progress towards equality. We should hold the line against those demands absolutely.</p><p>I was proud of Scotland&#8217;s Parliament&#8212;not as a MSP but as a citizen&#8212;not only when it repealed section 28 but when it held the line against the forces of social conservatism and homophobia and did not give into the demands for concessions. We should be equally proud today and over the months to come not only of passing the legislation but of holding the line against demands for amendments that would weaken the principle of equality. We should also listen seriously to the calls for amendments on issues that members have mentioned, such as the spousal veto, overseas civil partnerships, gender neutral language and gender recognition for younger people. If we do that, we will deserve the pride of many Scottish citizens when we pass the bill at stage 3.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22752660", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer, for the privilege of taking part in this debate.

Although the political tensions between supporters and opponents of independence were not completely absent, they were tempered and constrained enough not to prevent us from carrying out our work effectively. Our convener chaired our proceedings with fairness and charm, and Annabel Goldie always wore highly suitable shoes. [Laughter.] She was consistently impressive on that score.</p><p>Tavish Scott told us that he was on occasion in a minority of one&#8212;all I can say is that I know the feeling. In fact, I would go further and recommend the experience to every member in the chamber. They should try it at least once or twice during their political careers.</p><p>The fact that we were able to be broadly consensual in committee has prompted many members to talk about the tone of our debate over the next 10 months and suggest that it should be respectful and of high quality. To be sure, we should be able to disagree respectfully, but we do not always manage to do that in politics and between political parties. However, I hope that we return to that respectful tone as often as we can. Indeed, it is the tone that the yes and no campaigners in this referendum should be aiming for if they are serious about persuading undecided voters because it is that and not some hostile and polarised debate that those voters will listen to.</p><p>It is hugely important that we get the legislation and the rules of the game right for the referendum and it is not only desirable but vital that we conduct it with agreed rules to ensure that the side that comes out with the result that it did not want is still willing to accept it. We need a meaningful referendum and, in that respect, losers&#8217; consent is going to be very important.</p><p>The aftermath&#8212;jubilation on one side and feelings of defeat and disappointment on the other&#8212;will be a tough enough circumstance for Scottish politics to come together again in, and we cannot afford to add to that complexity with a contentious process. I am therefore very glad that all sides seem happy with the bill. Many of the issues were successfully addressed by the agreement between the Scottish and UK Governments, which set the initial tone that allowed the broadly consensual committee process that followed.</p><p>What comes next? The implementation. There was a good degree of confidence among committee members&#8212;as I hope there is among all members&#8212;in the mechanics and the administration. We have a good degree of confidence that the referendum will be conducted to a high standard and that the process will carry the confidence of the country. We also need compelling political arguments from both sides. I want both sides to bring compelling and testing arguments to the debate. The white paper that the Government will publish soon will, no doubt, set out the Scottish Government&#8217;s current position in great depth. Perhaps in slightly less depth, the Green Party will tomorrow launch its campaign for a green yes vote. Although I admit that tender heads may still be wondering about our decision to launch the campaign on the day after our work&#8217;s night out, the Green Party will set out its own case for a yes vote.</p><p>The radical independence conference that will take place later in the month will set out a wide range of views on the left of Scottish politics, and perhaps some compelling arguments that are not heard in the chamber will be heard at that conference. I would welcome views of the same breadth, depth and passion on the no side of the argument. I challenge the idea that Scotland is on pause. In fact, this has been one of the most exciting and creative times&#8212;not always in the chamber, but in wider political debate&#8212;in which organisations, whether or not they are strictly neutral, have been asking questions of both sides and setting out their agendas for the possibilities of independence. This has been one of the most creative times that I can remember in Scottish politics, and we should conduct the referendum campaigns in that spirit so that, whichever result the Scottish people choose, we have the momentum to take some of those creative ideas forward. I believe that we will be better placed to put them into practice if we get a yes vote, but I want the debate on both sides to be of that standard.</p><p>Above all, we must drive up participation. If we have compelling, creative and imaginative argument, we will see a strong turnout. Everybody agrees that the result should not be contingent on an arbitrary, fixed level of turnout, but that is not to say that turnout does not matter. Scotland&#8217;s political culture will be much healthier if we have all taken part in the decision together.</p><p>I close by echoing the sentiments that other members have expressed. The Scottish Independence Referendum Bill Committee should expand its remit and take evidence on the white paper. The subject committees will want to look at certain aspects, but the constitutional transitional questions also need scrutiny and all sides should be willing to have that debate on the record in committee over the coming months.</p>", "hdate": "2013-11-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22742673", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I begin by once again offering my thanks to everyone who contributed to the committee&#8217;s work as we moved through stages 1 and 2 of the two referendum bills.

In its written submission to the Leveson inquiry, the organisation Object provided examples of sexualisation or demeaning articles about women from The Sun, The Daily Star and the Daily Sport from a single week in November 2011. Leveson concluded:</p><p>&#8220;all three titles contained what can only be described as objectifying material.

There is something about the context of it&#8212;it is not only about the content. It is a form of expression that seems to expect men who look at it to respond with a blandness in sexuality. In reality, many men respond&#8212;as I always have&#8212;with a frisson of discomfort. It is important that, as part of a campaign to persuade The Sun to drop page 3, many men express that discomfort and state why they feel it.</p><p>Later on in his report, Lord Leveson addresses the issues that Jackie Baillie and others mentioned around Clare Short and others having campaigned against page 3:</p><p>&#8220;she was described by The Sun as &#8216;fat&#8217;, &#8216;ugly&#8217; and &#8216;jealous of beautiful women&#8217;. When the Rt Hon Harriet Harman proposed legislation &#8230; in 2010, she was described as a &#8216;harridan&#8217; and a &#8216;feminist fanatic&#8217; on a &#8216;furious rant&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>When Lynne Featherstone raised the same issues,</p><p>&#8220;she was described as a &#8216;battleaxe&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p>Leveson concludes that paragraph by saying that</p><p>&#8220;Describing the female critics of Page 3 as fat, ugly, jealous, feminist fanatics, harridans, and battleaxes goes some way to proving their point.&#8221;</p><p>That is very well put.</p><p>When reading some of the online comments that are critical of the no more page 3 campaign, it is easy to find the same tired old arguments that we have seen over many years: &#8220;It&#8217;s just a bit of harmless fun&#8221;, or &#8220;You&#8217;re only jealous.&#8221; Many members have demonstrated&#8212;through evidence of a connection to serious acts of sexual violence, or of the driving of attitudes that inform a countless myriad of thousands upon thousands of smaller examples of everyday sexism, whose cumulative impact is just as important in our society&#8212;that it is not harmless fun.</p><p>Other arguments focus on the idea that critics are anti-sex. People say, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with seeing naked bodies?&#8221; and &#8220;It&#8217;s celebrating beauty.&#8221; As others, including Alison Johnstone, have said, page 3 highlights and promotes only one fixed, narrow, rigid and quite unusual form of body; it celebrates only a narrow concept of what constitutes beauty.</p><p>As someone who would hate to be described as anti-sex, I want to live in a society that is comfortable and confident in expressing a range of attitudes about sex, sexuality and&#8212;yes&#8212;eroticism, as part of human nature.

I am very pleased to have heard so many positive comments from around the chamber, notwithstanding the previous speech, which it seemed to me was really expressing frustration at the fact that we have not come here with a single, specific, fully developed proposal but, rather, that we are opening a debate. Alison Johnstone&#8217;s motion clearly seeks further debate on this general area.</p><p>Over the years, I have taken part in many debates on active travel&#8212;walking and cycling&#8212;and at times I have felt just a tiny wee bit of a fraud. Although I was a regular cyclist as a student in Manchester, when I cycled up Oxford Road and Wilmslow Road, which at the time was the busiest bus route in Europe&#8212;it felt pretty dangerous&#8212;in Glasgow I was frankly scared to cycle.</p><p>I did not want to cycle in Glasgow because I saw the state of the roads, with the potholes forcing cyclists in and out and in and out in busy roads; the lamentable state of cycling provision, such as the appallingly inadequate cycle lanes, some of which simply disappear in the middle of the road for no apparent reason; and the behaviour of some motorists. However, this summer I took the plunge and swapped my bus pass for a bike and I could not have been happier since. It is a hugely positive change in the way that I get about, and I will count it as an unhappy day if I find myself still reliant on the services of First Glasgow.</p><p>The scenes that I have experienced are mixed. I have seen cyclists occasionally shooting a red light or cycling somewhere they should not, including the pavement. To be honest, I understand that they sometimes do that because they would not feel safe otherwise; they do it to maximise their safety because of the state of the provision that has been made available to them, not to try to pose a threat to others or because they are being reckless with the safety of others.</p><p>Far more often than seeing a cyclist shooting a red light, cycling on a pavement or cycling at night without lights, I see motorists trying to get through lights before or just after they have changed&#8212;trying to take the last little opportunity to shoot through lights&#8212;cutting each other up, or cutting up cyclists. My personal favourite is motorists&#8217; failure to indicate. That is so common in Glasgow that, to be frank, one does not pay attention to the little blinking lights, because they will not say what the vehicle will do. There is no correlation between what people use their indicators for and which direction the vehicle will move in.</p><p>There is a real need to address the responsibility that people feel. The responsibility that somebody feels when they are moving a tonne or two of metal through the streets must be substantially greater than the responsibility that somebody feels when they are moving a couple of tens of kilos of metal through the streets. Moving a bicycle through the streets at a modest pace is still a significant thing to do and it bears a significant responsibility, but it is clear that the responsibility of somebody who is driving a couple of tonnes of metal through the streets at a much higher velocity must be greater.</p><p>Unlike Margaret Mitchell, I do not think that an approach to stricter liability of whatever formulation we end up debating would suddenly encourage cyclists to be much more irresponsible. The logic of that, because of the hierarchical nature of the issue, is that it would encourage lots of pedestrians to run all over the roads and cause accidents. I think that the approach would send a signal to people that cycling matters, that cyclists&#8217; safety matters, and that every road user is responsible for their impact on other people.</p><p>The change would do one crucial thing, which is one of the most important things that we can do to make cycling safer in Scotland: it would get more cyclists out on the roads. It would normalise cycling and make it impossible for any driver to regard cyclists as an inconvenient and unnecessary intrusion into their private use of road space.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22713818", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strict Liability"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to my colleague Alison Johnstone on securing the debate.

It might be the first debate with that phrase in the subject title, but the topic has been discussed in many chamber debates as well as in parliamentary committee meetings on many occasions.</p><p>I welcome the fact that we are having a debate specifically on CCS, because during previous exchanges on the topic the Greens have sought to highlight some concerns about the development of CCS technology. However, they are concerns, not objections.</p><p>There have been times when we have been, perhaps unintentionally, misrepresented as being opposed to the development of CCS technology. I say again that we welcome the research that is being conducted and are interested in finding out, as Murdo Fraser said, not only whether the technology is technically viable but whether it can be sufficiently cost effective and can achieve the right energy balance and carbon balance&#8212;in fact, whether it has the potential that very many people claim that it already has. There have been times when Fergus Ewing and others have talked about CCS as though it is already here. They have talked about the incredibly important role that it can play, not the incredibly important role that it might play.</p><p>I will give an example. A report from SSE and Shell about the Peterhead project landed on my desk today; I am sure that other members have been sent the same thing. Its cover says:</p><p>&#8220;Up here,&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>by an arrow pointing to the sky&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;too much CO2 is a problem. Deep down under the North Sea we have a solution.&#8221;</p><p>No, they do not. Deep down under the North Sea they are working on a solution&#8212;maybe. That would be a more honest representation of the facts.</p><p>The solution is not there yet. It may be there and, if it is, I will welcome it as a transitional technology as we move away from fossil fuel consumption. It would allow us to ease that transition somewhat. It is not an alternative and should not be used to suggest that we can carry on using fossil fuels for ever, because even if CCS technology is technically and commercially viable and achieves the right carbon balance, it still will not last for ever&#8212;we would still be talking about using a finite space to store a finite commodity. It will last a certain amount of time and allow us&#8212;if it works&#8212;to ease that transition. However, we do not have it yet and we must not rely on it.</p><p>One of the dangers that Greens have sought to highlight is that CCS is used politically as a pretext to justify increased fossil fuel energy generating capacity now, before CCS is available to deploy. We debated that in the last parliamentary session in relation to the proposed Hunterston coal-fired power station. A second danger is that CCS is used for enhanced oil recovery.</p><p>The minister told me that I should welcome the extraction of huge amounts of oil&#8212;he suggested in previous debates that that would be hugely beneficial and that Greens ought to welcome it. If oil is going to be extracted from a reserve, then it will make sense to put carbon back in there. However, if that oil would otherwise not have been extracted, we would be taking fossil fuels from one location in the earth, burning them to produce energy, putting the carbon in another location in the earth and taking more fossil fuel from that location for use in energy sources that cannot have CCS applied to them. That fossil carbon will end up in the atmosphere at the end of the day. In the current political context, it is unlikely that enhanced oil recovery is an alternative to exploiting new reserves, because the Scottish Government supports the everlasting support of new, additional reserves of fossil fuels for extraction.</p><p>I am sorry that I missed the briefing that the Government kindly offered. I had the task of moving some amendments to the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill and I am sure that the minister would not have wanted me to miss that important duty. However, I took the opportunity to meet Professor Haszeldine and Mr Redmond before the debate and I got the impression that they both understand the concerns that enhanced oil recovery will lead to a carbon balance that undermines our objectives to reduce emissions, and the danger that CCS&#8212;or the potential for CCS&#8212;will be used as a pretext in the short term to justify increased fossil fuel extraction and use.</p><p>Fergus Ewing told us in his opening speech that CCS technology offers us clean electricity, new jobs and reduced emissions. Maybe, but only if the dangers that I seek to highlight are understood, acknowledged and avoided.</p><p>It is also important that we note the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#8217;s recent report and the increasingly unavoidable body of evidence that the world has far more fossil fuels in existing reserves than we can afford to burn. Paul Wheelhouse, the climate change minister, seemed to acknowledge that recently when he said:</p><p>&#8220;I have put it on record that I accept that we can&#8217;t burn all the fossil fuels that there are, and that applies to Scotland as with every nation.&#8221;</p><p>I would be interested to know whether Fergus Ewing has sat down and discussed the question of how much unburnable carbon Scotland has. Every time he talks about assessments of the value of 3 billion barrels of oil that CCS technology can unlock, he talks about it only as a positive economic resource. Oil and fossil fuels can be an economic resource if we use them within the limits of the environment that sustains us. If we use those resources beyond that limit, it is an economic liability and a threat to the very existence of our civilisation.</p>", "hdate": "2013-10-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22698981", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carbon Capture and Storage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In opening the debate, Fergus Ewing said that it was the first debate that we have had on carbon capture and storage.

The dominance of the retail giants may well mean that a few loss leaders are offered, but only when people are bombarded with advertising that tells them to buy overpriced, overprocessed and unhealthy products as well. The decline in food skills in our society, coupled with the decline in the time that many people have available to grow, prepare and cook their own food is another element that results in the change in people&#8217;s relationship with food, from its being a form of nourishment and a natural product to a commercial product on which they rely.</p><p>Similar dominance by a handful of multinationals and big businesses can be seen in energy, banking and many other sectors of our economy.

However, even the cabinet secretary, who I think in all honesty seeks to broaden the national performance framework into a more holistic document, spoke of that brightening outlook principally in GDP terms. Even when he went on to discuss employment, it was all about the numbers and not about the quality of employment or the livability of real incomes.</p><p>He also said that &#8220;recovery remains in its early stages&#8221;, but I will go further and say that our understanding of what recovery even means is yet to develop properly. When the economic crisis was unfolding, I said that there must be a difference, as recovery could not mean simply patching up the patient. Recovery means not reanimating a corpse, but dealing with the underlying disease. Recovery cannot be allowed to mean getting back to business as usual.</p><p>The UK Government&#8217;s austerity policy, which is trying to sustain a fundamentally unsustainable market-dominated economic model, has been criticised effectively on many occasions. I believe, as the Green amendment states, that the green new deal, which has been promoted for the past five years and updated in the past month or so, is the most consistent and coherent alternative plan for the UK.</p><p>The green new deal group&#8217;s most recent report, &#8220;The Green New Deal 5th Anniversary Report: A national plan for the UK&#8221;, outlines a programme of green quantitative easing. That is very different from simply dumping created money on to the money markets; it involves genuine investment in the real economy, in the jobs and economic activity that will help to transform the economy.</p><p>The report suggests controls on the banks that have been bailed out to ensure that they also invest in the real economy, and the use of green QE to buy out private finance initiative deals, which would free up money for investment at a local government level as well as nationally.</p><p>It is inspiring at present to see the way in which that same agenda, under various names, is gaining momentum in Scotland. In the past few years Oxfam has drawn up its humankind index&#8212;which we have debated in the chamber and which, I think, has helped to inform John Swinney&#8217;s work&#8212;the Carnegie Trust has produced its report &#8220;Shifting the Dial in Scotland&#8221; and the Church of Scotland has published the report of its special commission on the purposes of economic activity.</p><p>As members know, I am pretty cynical about religion, so I particularly enjoy quoting the Church of Scotland&#8217;s special commission on the purposes of economic activity. Its report states:</p><p>&#8220;All economies are embedded in social relationships. Refusal to name this has created a situation in which society too often seems to exist for the benefit of the markets.&#8221;</p><p>It goes on to assert that</p><p>&#8220;This is no time for business as usual.&#8221;</p><p>Subsequently, Oxfam has continued its work by publishing the reports, &#8220;Whose Economy?: Winners and losers in the new Scottish economy&#8221; and more recently &#8220;Our Economy: Towards a new prosperity&#8221;, while the Jimmy Reid Foundation has contributed by publishing its paper on &#8220;The Common Weal: a model for economic and social development in Scotland&#8221;.</p><p>Taken together, those documents&#8212;and others&#8212;offer a transformational vision of a better Scotland, a more equal society and a more sustainable economy.</p><p>Iain Gray complained that the Scottish Government is focusing only on independence instead of on the economy&#8212;and went on to make a speech which was almost entirely about independence. Last week, and again today, we heard members on the Labour side of the chamber making the case that Scotland is on hold because of the referendum, even though&#8212;as far as I am aware&#8212;all political parties have now accepted the need to hold one.</p><p>The argument that Scotland is on hold might sometimes be true within the chamber, where, frankly, any one of us is capable of turning any debate into a proxy for independence. However, that is not true outside the chamber. So much of the work that is being done by all those organisations, which are offering new transformational ideas, is being generated here in Scotland in the context of the constitutional debate. Many of those ideas have relevance for either a yes or a no result. Even with the current powers of devolution, we might be able to achieve 10 or 20 per cent of the ambition that they embody. We can&#8212;and must&#8212;begin that right now, but we should not settle for 10 or 20 per cent.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22697073", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "John Swinney began, after reminding us that it is five years since the economic crisis that precipitated the recession, by saying that there has recently been a brightening economic outlook.

That is not simply a matter for current issues&#8212;which I will avoid, Presiding Officer&#8212;but goes back a long time.

It is not a new problem.</p><p>It is also an issue for the future because Fergus Ewing, as well as other members on the other side of the chamber, said that restoration is possible only if we allow the creation of an even bigger problem for the future&#8212;restoration can only be paid for by even further destruction. That is simply not an argument that we should accept.</p><p>The minister said that he wants to engage with all those who have a constructive interest in sustaining the industry.

I urge it to return to that position. Let us be clear about jobs for the future of Scotland&#8212;not for the past. A low-carbon, low-energy, resource-efficient economy would be dramatically more job rich than the one that we have now.</p><p>A comment was made about Alex Rowley saying that we should be extremely careful with future consents. Surely, at the very least, such care means not giving consent until the restoration issue has been resolved.</p><p>Murdo Fraser seemed concerned about feeding the coal-fired power stations that are still part of our energy mix. The reality is that they are reducing their demand, whether through conversion to biomass at Drax, through importing less sulphurous coal because of the necessary environmental regulations that have been put in place or, in some cases, because they will simply be closing down.

We have managed to achieve more consensus than people might have expected us to do on such a high-profile issue.</p><p>There are two areas in relation to which I want to explore remaining doubts and uncertainty: campaign rules and purdah. In my exchange with James Kelly about organisations that work together, I did not intend to generate more heat than light. I agree with James Kelly that there are areas that we need to explore further. That is not necessarily a criticism of the bill; these are issues that the Electoral Commission will have to resolve and give clear guidance on.</p><p>Referendum expenses that are incurred as part of a common plan&#8212;when individuals or organisations, who will not necessarily meet the threshold for declaring expenses or registration as a permitted participant, are working together&#8212;will have to be declared as common expenses in both sets of declarations. We will end up with the appearance of twice as much money having been spent.</p><p>Therefore, the same amount of money being spent only once would have to be declared in both organisations&#8217; expenses. For example, the radical independence campaign might be dishing out leaflets for a Jimmy Reid Foundation public meeting. Does that mean that everything spent on arranging that public meeting would have to be declared by both organisations? We could be in a situation in which individuals and small organisations that do not expect to meet that threshold do so accidentally without realising that they have to declare it as such.</p><p>The Electoral Commission, in producing the guidance, needs to strike a proper balance between allowing small organisations and individuals to campaign in the referendum as they see fit and taking account of James Kelly&#8217;s proper concerns about organisations perhaps co-operating too closely and being, in effect, a single organisation. I do not expect that to happen, but the rules have to strike a proper balance.</p><p>It is less relevant in the case that James Kelly mentioned because the provision in the bill that deals with referendum expenses states:</p><p>&#8220;this paragraph does not treat any expenses incurred by or on behalf of a permitted participant that is a designated organisation as having been incurred also by or on behalf of any other individual or body.&#8221;</p><p>Therefore, for Yes Scotland and Better Together, the rule about common plans does not apply in the same way. My concern is about small organisations and individuals.</p><p>There is very often too much power in money in our politics. A very wealthy person gets a vote. A very wealthy person can go out and pound the streets like everybody else or take part in public debate like everybody else. Very often in our politics in this country, big money talks a wee bit too loudly and we need campaign rules that prevent that from becoming problematic.</p><p>On the purdah issue, I had initial concerns about the idea of Parliament having its normal recess dates but meeting in the run-up to the referendum. I think that the Government&#8217;s proposed solution was a reasonable one. I regret that it was not acceptable to both sides; I think that it should have been.</p><p>Late on in our stage 1 process, we discovered that mismatch between the dates and I think that that issue still needs to be resolved. Removing the SPCB from the bill is one way of doing so. Other caveats in the bill might be possible to achieve that resolution. We really must expect that, in the last days before we break and go out to campaign, anything will be turned into a proxy for the independence campaign. In our Business Bulletin today we have subordinate legislation on everything from photocopying fees to fish labelling. I doubt that any member would find it difficult to turn any such legislation into a fight about independence in the last week before the referendum if they chose to do so. We therefore need to ensure that nothing is constrained.</p><p>I would like to reflect on a debate that I took part in last week in Glasgow, which was organised by the Equality Network and looked at LGBT equality in the context of the referendum. There were three speakers on one side, three on the other and a very neutral chair. It was a very well-organised meeting. It was passionate, it was really well informed, and it was a lively, sparky debate from the audience as well as the panellists. However, every single one of them managed to conduct that debate in a spirit not just of respect but of good humour and friendship.</p><p>That spirit is what we need to aim for. It is not always easy, and sometimes the first instinct of a politician or an activist is to sink to the lowest level of the people who are attacking them. We all need to resist that if we are going to have the debate that Scotland deserves. Come what may, once the people have decided and chosen whether they like the yes Scotland badges or the better together badges best, we are all going to have to move on and implement the will of the people in whatever way they have chosen. We should be able to do that in the same spirit of respect, good humour and friendship.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22696378", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I ask the member to let me get under way a wee bit, please.

We have heard many speeches from SNP back benchers portraying this legislative programme as the best that it could possibly be from a Government that is led by the finest First Minister that we could possibly have, whereas many in the Opposition parties have pretended that the case is entirely the opposite&#8212;a utopian dream versus a nightmare vision. Alison Johnstone was perhaps the first speaker in yesterday&#8217;s debate to recognise that the truth lies probably somewhere in between.</p><p>I have been in this job for 10 years, and I think that every legislative programme that I have seen has been a bit of a mixed bag. This one really is no different: there are some things to welcome and some things to oppose; there are things that should be welcomed with caution and scrutinised; and, certainly, there are some missed opportunities. It is the same every year, whoever is in government. I do not think that Alex Salmond is a hero or a demon; he is a politician. As politicians, we are often a pretty flawed bunch, although very few of us manage to live down fully to our public reputation.</p><p>I want to look at two themes: the Government&#8217;s argument&#8212;in particular, the First Minister&#8217;s argument&#8212;which casts this legislative programme as a further step in articulating the concept of the social wage, and the criticism from the other side that we have a Government on pause or a Government that has become a campaign. Let me quote from the First Minister&#8217;s statement:</p><p>&#8220;Far from being a something-for-nothing culture, the social wage is a contract that we have with the people of Scotland. To suggest that that is something for nothing is to mimic the bankrupt ideology that prevails in the Westminster Parliament.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 3 September 2013; c 21876.]</p><p>I very much welcome those words, but I wish that they showed through in a bit more reality. I lost count of the number of comments about the need for a competitive tax environment. Tax competition has been one of the real flaws in that Westminster ideology. Under that pro-big business agenda, we see bungs continually going not only to big businesses in general but occasionally even to tax dodgers and those who facilitate tax dodging. If we are serious about moving away from that flawed ideological model of Westminster, we need to make that a reality.</p><p>On the other hand, regarding Jackie Baillie&#8217;s passionate call for action now on the bedroom tax, well&#8212;to quote someone&#8212;I get that. I have not seen the detail, but I hope to be able to support her bill. I think that we should be straining at the limits of the available powers not only now but in acting for the future. My frustration with that criticism that has run through both days&#8217; debates is that, while figures on the Labour benches have said that we can act now only with the powers that we have, figures on the SNP benches have said that we can act only once we have all the powers. No&#8212;we must do both. I say to colleagues who want the same outcome as I want next year that we must strain every muscle against the limits of the existing powers of devolution in order to articulate those limits, to show people that this Parliament has not enough power and to indicate our intent.</p><p>While listening to Jackie Baillie&#8217;s words about action on the bedroom tax, although I agreed with her I found myself being reminded of the source of so much disappointment during new Labour&#8217;s 13 years in government at Westminster. Labour threw extra cash at things that it believed in&#8212;many of them were things that I believe in&#8212;but it did not address the structural causes of the poverty and inequality that it sought remedial action to deal with. We saw the gap between rich and poor continue to widen even as Labour tried to put safety nets in place. That was simply not enough. As I said in my intervention on Christina McKelvie yesterday, following the post-war movement towards greater social justice and equality to close that gap between rich and poor, from the Thatcher Government onwards&#8212;including those 13 years of new Labour&#8212;we saw the dominance of a market-led, ever more unequal, centre-right consensus, which has always failed the many even though the UK political parties are still clinging to it.</p><p>There are three dominant political parties in the UK, but we need not just the chance to change one party for another or to swap one UK Government for another. There is a problem with that Westminster mindset. For too many, economic recovery simply means getting back to business as usual, with all priorities subordinated to the self-defeating pursuit of everlasting economic growth. We saw that centre-right economic model functioning and achieving economic growth, and it did not achieve greater equality, because the social and environmental costs of growth that were generated were heaped on those who were least able to defend themselves and who benefited least from that economic growth. We must not make the same mistakes here. The debate that we are engaged in about Scotland&#8217;s future should not paralyse us in the face of the urgent political, social, economic and ecological challenges that we face; it must encompass them.</p><p>We have the opportunity to be the generation that faced up to those challenges, not the one that hid from them&#8212;to be the generation that took the power to ourselves. Let us not be the generation that wakes up in 20 years&#8217; time and regrets the failure to take those opportunities and to vote yes in the referendum next year. Let us be the generation that took the power and took the opportunity and started to make our society the better place that it can be.</p>", "hdate": "2013-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22695490", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Programme for Government 2013-14"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like many debates on legislative programmes over the years, this year&#8217;s have occasionally been needlessly polarised.

I am very glad to see both interest in that concept growing and the contribution that Oxfam has made.</p><p>Everlasting economic growth on a single planet with finite resources is not possible. The faster we come up against the limits to growth and the harder we strain against them, the more the pursuit of everlasting economic growth will harm not just people but the ecological systems that we depend on for our very survival. Throughout all the years of economic growth that the UK experienced before the current recession, inequality increased, ecological harm increased and the proportion of wealth generated in the economy that was hoarded by a tiny minority of very rich individuals and businesses increased year after year.</p><p>In the limited time that is available to me, the one argument that I will highlight from the report concerns closing the labour market divide. The inequality between rich and poor cannot be addressed simply by the living wage, although I believe strongly in providing a living wage. That inequality cannot be addressed through generous welfare provision for those who are out of work, although I believe strongly in that. The gap between rich and poor cannot be addressed by looking at only one side of the equation; it must also be addressed by looking at the hoarding of vast amounts of our country&#8217;s wealth by a tiny handful of corporate and individual hoarders.</p><p>We should act right now on the argument about linking earnings equality to state support&#8212;the fourth bullet point in the labour market divide section of the report&#8217;s executive summary. We could do that in the public sector. Our water company is publicly owned, yet its chief executive is one of the highest-paid people in the public sector. Nobody needs to be paid a third of a million pounds a year, and certainly not from taxpayers&#8217; money. The same is true of our railway. It is not a publicly owned company, but we pay for it. We should not expect such a level of wage inequality in the delivery of public services.</p><p>We could go further and attach conditions on wage inequalities to the support&#8212;the corporate welfare&#8212;that we provide through Government grants and support services for the business community. We should not just argue for a living wage at the bottom but give a lead on closing the gap and on lower wage ratios throughout our economy.

Alison McInnes&#8217;s amendments 2 and 3 specify length of sentence. My amendment 4 returns to the argument for a repeal of the ban on prisoners voting altogether. Margo MacDonald&#8217;s amendment 7 seeks to address the issue through sentencing guidelines.</p><p>I would like the chamber to recognise that this is not simply the whim of a small number of MSPs. I am pretty sure that only a small number of MSPs will vote for any of these amendments and I do not expect suddenly to change everyone&#8217;s mind, but it is important that these arguments are put on the record because of the breadth of non-parliamentary support that they have attracted.</p><p>We have had evidence from the Howard League for Penal Reform, the Prison Reform Trust, Sacro and a range of academics, such as Professors Fergus McNeill, Mike Nellis and Alec Spencer, as well as written evidence from the Quakers. Although at its most recent general assembly the Church of Scotland was not able to adopt a formal position, the convener of the church and society council continues to support the argument and intends to return to the debate within the church later in the year.</p><p>It is important to recognise the arguments that have been put on a point of principle: what is prison for? Generally we expect that there are three purposes of prison: protecting society, punishing offenders and rehabilitation. Which of those purposes is served by the blanket ban on prisoners voting?</p><p>I defy anyone to tell me that it is genuinely a source of punishment and that the inability to vote in elections or in referendums is genuinely perceived as punishment by offenders. Does it protect society? It is inconceivable that an offender poses a greater threat to society when they are in prison simply by virtue of having a vote.</p><p>The third purpose of prison is rehabilitation, which can be served only by underlining to convicted prisoners that they are going to return to society and we expect them to behave as a part of society&#8212;by underlining the importance of citizenship and the understanding that democratic participation is a right. The Prison Reform Trust says:</p><p>&#8220;We believe that there is a clear and unambiguous case for reform. This rests on the conviction that voting is not a privilege. It is a basic human right. It is certainly not a reward to be granted to those whom the Government has judged morally decent.&#8221;</p><p>The trust points out that</p><p>&#8220;The UK is out of step with all but five member states of the Council of Europe, as well as with the majority of developed nations throughout the world.&#8221;</p><p>The position in the UK and in Scotland is not a normal one; it is not a mainstream one. As well as the other organisations that I have mentioned, the Scottish Trades Union Congress has written to members to argue against a restrictive interpretation of the right to vote. There is a clear case for reform, and for sending the message that prisoners are expected to return to society as participants in society, including in the democratic process.</p><p>I find it bizarre that the Government continues to be determined to resist change on this matter despite a theoretical commitment to incorporating the European convention on human rights at the heart of a written constitution for Scotland. If the Government wants to put human rights at the heart of a written constitution for Scotland&#8212;which I would welcome&#8212;it has implicitly accepted that convicted prisoners will have the right to vote in elections. If that is the case, there is no rational argument for a more restrictive approach to referendum franchise than to electoral franchise.

The amendment no longer contains a requirement on Government to introduce such variations; it simply enables Government to introduce variations.

The central Scotland green network has been mentioned, as have sustainable and active travel, renewables and the electricity grid. Although many of us will always come to the chamber and say that we want more or that we want a strong focus on such things, I put it on record that there are aspects of the documents that I welcome and which I hope will be strengthened rather than downgraded in the final draft.</p><p>However, as I have mentioned, there are aspects of the documents that need to be questioned. For example, I question whether the Captain project&#8212;the coal gasification plant&#8212;will be fully CCS compliant from day 1 of its operation and whether it will be prevented from continuing to operate if the CCS technology does not achieve what it sets out to achieve. I also question the role that the Scottish Government sees unconventional gas extraction having. It will add ever more to our stocks of fossil fuels. That is a threat, not an opportunity.</p><p>In transport, the emphasis continues to be on aviation expansion. In addition, some detail is missing. I mentioned the issue of individual turbines, which I look forward to pursuing with the minister. I had hoped to hear something about the Government&#8217;s target for community-owned land and community-owned energy. A clearer emphasis in the planning system on achieving those things might have been helpful.</p><p>I want to reflect on Sarah Boyack&#8217;s speech. I very much welcomed the thrust of it and the critique that she offered of sustainable economic growth. I welcome her to that argument, which I have been making since the Government introduced the term to its programme back in 2007, and I would be happy to share some of my best lines with her, if she is interested. I particularly enjoy describing sustainable economic growth as the Government&#8217;s central contradiction, because as well as being inherently unsustainable, the relentless pursuit of GDP growth fails to achieve economic justice, equality or human wellbeing when it takes place in already wealthy societies.</p><p>I also welcome Sarah Boyack&#8217;s comments on housing and energy, including heat, and hope that the minister will reflect on that argument before producing the final proposals for both documents.</p><p>However, from a Green perspective, it is understandable that many of the arguments in which I have involved myself in this debate have been about the issue of growth. It is clear that from now on economic growth considerations will trump&#8212;I use that word quite consciously&#8212;environmental considerations. After all, as happened in the Menie estate scandal, when big money talks, the Scottish planning system seems to roll over.</p><p>My former colleagues from the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee, Mike MacKenzie and Chic Brodie, took issue with the Green analysis of growth. After calling for the Government to use clearer language, Mr Brodie attempted to define the term &#8220;sustainable economic growth&#8221;&#8212;and after listening to his effort, I can only advise the minister to look elsewhere for a plain English consultant. Mr Brodie also suggested that before we can achieve social and environmental objectives we need economic activity to generate wealth. My response to that is no&#8212;before we can sustain any kind of economy, we must come to live within the ecological limits that the planet itself has laid down. Before we can have a good society, we must challenge the selfish values of the current economic model.</p><p>Kenny Gibson offered a definition of sustainable economic growth from, I think, the OECD. I will read the Official Report to see his precise form of words, but I am pretty sure that the Government does not report its own economic progress in line with that definition. However, the OECD offers a rather shorter definition of the term as</p><p>&#8220;that which sustains human and environmental as well as economic capital.&#8221;</p><p>Although that is interesting, I think that there is very little difference between that and sustainable development. If so, I have to question why sustainable development has been replaced by growth as the central objective in the planning system.</p><p>That said, I want to twist this argument into something more positive. The Government&#8217;s other NPF&#8212;the national performance framework&#8212;has positive scope to move us beyond GDP in the same way that the Government&#8217;s adviser Joseph Stiglitz has argued that the world itself should move beyond GDP. That is why it is so troubling to see growth enshrined not only in policy but in law, as the Government is doing in the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill, before that debate on alternatives to GDP progresses.</p><p>Frankly, if the Green Party, of all people, did not challenge that notion, I would wonder what it was for. Mine might be the only amendment tonight that is not supported by the chamber and it might well be that the Greens will be the only people voting against the Government motion, but as a wise philosopher once said:</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that easy bein&#8217; green&#8221;.</p><p>I think, especially at the end of a debate such as this, that it is the only colour I want to be.</p>", "hdate": "2013-06-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22693618", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Planning Framework 3 and Scottish Planning Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I think that I said in my opening speech that planning was sometimes not thought of as a particularly sexy subject, but I admit that the planning nerd in me has got a bit of a kick out of the debate&#8212;I have enjoyed it very much.

Where the consensus breaks down is elsewhere. In a letter that was published in The Herald today, Mr Douglas McAdam from Scottish Land &amp; Estates argues:</p><p>&#8220;The reality is that Scotland does have a varied pattern of land ownership&#8221;.</p><p>There are people who will deny point-blank the statistics that we have heard about a few hundred people owning half of the country. There are people who will deny that such a situation is inherently inequitable. There are those who will wish merely to make the current maldistribution of land in this country less problematic.</p><p>Those of us who want to be part of a consensus should be clear that the current maldistribution is unacceptable and that we are seeking to change it rather than merely ameliorate it. The decision of the land reform review group to focus on such a narrow interpretation of its remit is therefore very disappointing. It now places emphasis on</p><p>&#8220;communities rather than relationships between individuals&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>which Malcolm Chisholm referred to in his speech&#8212;and on focusing on</p><p>&#8220;considering how the benefits of community ownership could be extended to more communities&#8221;.</p><p>Andy Wightman has rightly suggested that the LRRG started out as a land reform review group and became a community ownership review group. It seems that other issues such as the position of the Crown Estate, common good land, taxation and succession will be considered only if and when it is thought that those issues will contribute to the community ownership objectives. That is very disappointing.</p><p>Alex Fergusson told us towards the beginning of the debate that the Government&#8217;s decision to commission a review group demonstrates a commitment to radical action; I suspect that Alex Fergusson is a little less naive than that. I think that he knows that sometimes Governments commission reports into things without having a commitment to act. We need to remember that there are people on both sides of the agenda who want to see radical action. However, there are people on both sides of the divide who, when they find themselves in government, find that it is easier to get cold feet.</p><p>On land value taxation, the minister seemed to imply that taxation measures might remain on the agenda to some extent, although I did not hear any specific proposals or commitments to action. I hope that Labour, in closing, can indicate whether it remains open to land value taxation. Both the larger parties, over the years, have shown some limited interest in the issue. They have never quite ruled it out, but they have never quite committed to it.</p><p>If we look at the consultation responses, some 82 per cent of the opposition to land value taxation came from estates, farm owners, land owners and their representatives.

I am also grateful to the Evening Times for raising awareness of the issue in its recent coverage. I hope that members will agree that public awareness of the operation of the tenancy deposit scheme is crucial, both among landlords and tenants, and that we must make far greater progress on that. I also thank the organisations that have issued briefings, including the National Union of Students, Citizens Advice Scotland, Shelter and the Edinburgh Solicitors Property Centre.</p><p>I also thank Glasgow Central citizens advice bureau for its work and for welcoming me for a visit yesterday to see their offices. During that visit I saw huge ranks of casework sat on their shelves. I was given to reflect on how one of those case files would have been mine a good number of years ago. Like a lot of people, I spent a period in the private rented sector&#8212;I spent around 10 years as a private rented sector tenant. On one occasion, which was just after I had moved back to Scotland from university, a particularly unpleasant landlord in Glasgow decided that he was not going to give me any paperwork, contract or even a letter to indicate that I had a tenancy. Therefore, I was not able to apply for housing benefit when I lost a job. That situation ultimately resulted in my having to call the police when he sent round a squad of boys to start removing doors and furniture and whatever they could to harass me and other tenants out of the flat.</p><p>In that instance, I was one of the lucky individuals&#8212;I had somewhere to go because I was able to fall back on the support of family. It would be so easy for many people to experience a much more vulnerable situation than that one that I found myself in. However, that situation reminds me how valuable the work is that citizens advice bureaux around the country and many other advice agencies do to help people avoid such situations.</p><p>Like other members, I have recently had queries in my in-box about the deposit schemes. The requirement for deposits to be lodged with an approved scheme is an important step forward and we should be pleased that it has happened. However, there are problems with the implementation and awareness of any new system like this.</p><p>One constituent in Glasgow contacted me recently. Living on the south side of Glasgow, she had sought assurances from her letting agent in March that her deposit had been lodged with an approved scheme, and she was told in person and through the firm&#8217;s website that it had. On checking with the scheme, she was told that there was no record of that letting agent working with the scheme or of any dealings whatever. The agency has since failed to offer a reason for making false assurances, or to pass my constituent details of her landlord so that she can establish whether the agency alone was responsible for those actions or whether the landlord was also responsible. She is still concerned for the other tenants that might be in a similar position. The letting agency disputes some aspects of that account but members will be only too aware of the circumstances of many tenants around the country who might not even be aware that they have the right to ask these questions.</p><p>I have received information from a citizens advice bureau about a particular client who asked her letting agent if the deposit was being paid into a scheme. The letting agent informed the client that she had in fact paid an advanced rent, not a deposit, and that the agent would take money away from that advanced rent for any repairs that were needed at the end of the tenancy. That was a clear attempt to get around the scheme by calling the deposit an advanced rent instead of a deposit.</p><p>Another client is concerned that he might not get back the full value of his &#163;750 deposit. The landlord said that she would get her sister to check the flat and decide on a bit of an ad hoc basis how much money would be paid back. No information was provided about compliance with the deposit scheme. In this case, as soon as the client started asking questions, the landlord started sending out notes about fairly arbitrary increases in rent. Again, that is another clear attempt to get round the scheme by getting unco-operative or unruly in order to get awkward questions from tenants simply to go away.</p><p>I also have a verbal account of a client who had been told by their former landlord that their deposit would be returned only once a new tenant had been found for the property, because the landlord simply did not have the money. That is indicative of the apparent view of some landlords and letting agents that a deposit is not really a deposit but a wee bonus to their income when they get a new tenant, which they have very little intention of handing back.</p><p>Tenants simply cannot afford to have their resources treated in that way. Very few of them can stump up the extra month&#8217;s rent for a new deposit when they move flat in the knowledge that their previous deposit might come back to them only after a long delay, if ever.</p><p>Members across the spectrum will acknowledge that the role of the private rented sector is important. It is needed. It is particularly important in some areas of the country, and it needs to be viable for landlords. However, it also needs to operate with a basic respect for the rights of tenants. Good-quality landlords and letting agents, who understand that they are not simply raking in cash from their properties but are selling a service to paying customers and have a duty to ensure that it is a high-quality service, have nothing to fear from proper regulation of the industry.</p><p>As my motion mentions, we are expecting legislation. The Government has indicated that it is open to the regulation of letting agents and mentioned that in its recently published strategy. We could consider other measures for inclusion in a bill and I encourage the minister and other members to consider stronger regulation of landlords such as management standards, which some Scottish National Party members supported when they were in Opposition and I debated the issue during the passage of a previous housing bill. We should also consider greater protection from unlawful eviction and harassment, such as a local authority power to prosecute. The end of short assured tenancies, as Shelter Scotland has suggested, would ensure that private sector tenants have a bit of security in a place that they can call home rather than knowing that they could be out in a matter of a month.</p><p>Presiding Officer, I know that I have gone slightly over time so perhaps I will mention one or two other issues if they come up and if there is an appropriate opportunity for an intervention.

However, we part company with the Government on the issue of franchising. Although there may be benefits to the collaborative approach with the industry that the Government&#8217;s motion sets out, we see the possibility of greater benefits from another approach.</p><p>There is a need for the travelling public to be much more fully involved in future decisions about franchising. Current train operating companies may be private-sector profit-seeking businesses, but Scotland&#8217;s railways are public services, and the public should be centrally involved in setting the priorities.</p><p>I want all the options to be open for Scotland in restoring a public service ethos to our rail business. We on the Green side of the chamber hope that Scotland will soon take on the powers to change UK legislation and open up new possibilities, which would include Labour&#8217;s option of a mutual or not-for-profit franchisee. Such a bid could be made at the moment, but realistically it will not materialise out of thin air. That option needs Government support, which would at present be inhibited. Private-sector bidders would be able to oppose such Government support for a not-for-profit operator, but we could in future remove that barrier.</p><p>We could go further and look again at the whole concept of franchising or at least permit publicly owned bodies to bid against other competitors. Against a public subsidy of just over &#163;300&#160;million in 2011-12, more than &#163;20&#160;million was taken out as profit in the ScotRail franchise. As Alex Johnstone said, the Scottish Government is then beholden to a haggling process to see whether any of that money can be put back into reinvestment. That is a substantial proportion of the public subsidy that we are paying.</p><p>The ideological obsession with privatisation reveals itself in relation to the east coast franchise. We have seen two private sector failures, and we have seen public sector rescue followed by broadly successful public sector management. Punctuality levels are up, and customer satisfaction on the line is at its highest ever level. More than &#163;800&#160;million has been returned to the taxpayer. The state-run east coast rail service requires less public subsidy than any of the 15 privately run rail franchises in Britain. That is according to the rail regulator. In April this year, it reported that the net subsidy for the east coast line was 1 per cent of its income compared with an average of 32 per cent.</p><p>As far as we understand, the UK Government has invited bids without reference to the Scottish Government or the interests of the travelling public in Scotland. That is a damning indictment of the ideological obsession with what should be a public service being run for private profit.</p><p>I very much welcome the briefing paper from Transform Scotland and I welcome the Liberal Democrat amendment, which refers to it. If we want rail to continue to grow not as part of a more-of-everything approach but to reduce car use&#8212;which the minister&#8217;s motion claims as a priority&#8212;there is a real need to ensure that rail services are not only reliable and affordable in absolute terms but competitive with road journeys on cost and journey time.</p><p>The Transform Scotland proposals are of direct relevance to that issue. For example, Transform Scotland&#8217;s proposals on the Highland main line cite the Edinburgh to Aberdeen comparison alongside the Edinburgh to Newcastle comparison. Those train journeys are of roughly the same distance&#8212;124 miles and 130 miles&#8212;and yet the one from Edinburgh to Aberdeen is 50 minutes slower than the one to Newcastle.</p><p>Transform Scotland said that it might have been a wee bit too conservative in the figures on the Perth to Inverness journey times in its briefing. The figures that it used, which are based on the AA&#8217;s figures, suggest that the leg from Perth to Inverness should take two hours and 33 minutes by car, but Transport Scotland&#8217;s figures suggest that the journey is typically 90 minutes to 110 minutes by car, which compares very poorly with the train service.</p><p>We need to prioritise the relatively modest investment that would be required to improve the Highland main line and make those services competitive for the future. Transform Scotland has also made proposals for the Edinburgh to Perth direct line. Reinstating that would not only give the chance for shorter intercity journeys within Scotland but free up capacity for improved local services in Fife.</p><p>Notwithstanding Tavish Scott&#8217;s assertions about the early days of devolution, for years we have seen a heavy emphasis on road investment. We need only to follow the money. Successive Scottish Administrations have prioritised road spending. The M74 was extended while Glasgow crossrail plans gathered dust on the shelf. The Aberdeen western peripheral route was pushed through on spurious cost projections while the Aberdeen crossrail suffers the same fate as its Glasgow comparator.</p><p>Current spending on the A9 and the additional Forth road bridge not only represent resources being diverted to road when they could have improved our rail infrastructure but could lead to a threat to the long-term competitiveness of rail services in the future.</p><p>I urge the Scottish Government to acknowledge not only what is good but what needs to be much better.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-06766.4, to leave out from first &#8220;acknowledges&#8221; to end and insert:</p><p>&#8220;recognises the constraints under which the ScotRail franchise must operate as a result of UK legislation, but considers that the Scottish Government could ensure greater transparency in its franchise decisions; believes that, when Scotland is able to remove the constraints of UK legislation, renationalisation of the railways or the use of a non-profit franchise holder would deliver better value for the public investment in Scotland&#8217;s railways; condemns the UK Government&#8217;s plans to reprivatise the profitable East Coast line, a decision that it understands was announced without reference to the Scottish Government; expresses concern that the Scottish Government&#8217;s road-building priorities risk making rail uncompetitive on price and journey times for routes north of the central belt, and believes that the public money currently committed to upgrading the A9 would be better spent on rail infrastructure, including the comparatively modest upgrades required to improve the Highland main line.&#8221;</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22692582", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Railways"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the debate, and I see positive things to celebrate about the state of our railways, which is why the Green and Independent amendment does not seek to delete the whole of the Government&#8217;s motion.

It is an extremely positive move. Like others, I have visited schools and hosted school groups in the Parliament and I tend to find pretty much the same range of enthusiasm, awareness and interest in politics as I do in other public meetings or out on the doorstep with other age groups. It seems completely wrong to deny young people the right to exercise the vote if they are interested in doing so.</p><p>Like other members, I want the voting age to be reduced for all elections. Helen Eadie was the first to mention that, but others have as well. What we do with this bill could be a huge step towards that or a step away from it, and that will be determined by turnout. If there is a pitiful turnout of 16 and 17-year-olds, we may well harm the wider, longer-term argument&#8212;whether in Scotland or the UK&#8212;about a reduced voting age in elections. It is down to all of us to try to achieve a really high turnout by ensuring that the education, the engagement and the promotion of participation are of a really high standard. If we get a really high turnout of 16 and 17-year-olds, we will have hugely strengthened the case for wider changes to the electoral franchise in the future in Scotland or the UK. I look forward to doing that.</p><p>Most of my remarks will address the issue of convicted prisoners voting. I acknowledge that the Deputy First Minister has said on several occasions in the chamber and in committee that it is for those who seek to advance the change to present arguments in favour of it and I intend to try to do so. However, I entirely reject the implication that the Government is not advancing a change in the position and does not need to demonstrate arguments for doing so. Generally speaking, the electoral franchise is used as the starting point for the franchise in referendums, and the Government is trying to advance a change away from that. Section 3 of the bill implies that, even if UK legislation on the electoral franchise is brought into line with ECHR, that will not be the case for this referendum. For this referendum, a blanket ban will continue to apply even if the electoral franchise is changed. The Government needs to advance a reason for that just as much as those of us who argue for the principle of ending the blanket ban on prisoners voting need to advance our arguments.</p><p>Our arguments are practical as well as legal and principled. On the practical arguments, the blanket ban throws up so many anomalies. Two people might be given exactly the same sentence on the same day, but because one of them is judged to be more of a threat to the public, they might serve parole and that could be knocked off the end of their sentence. They could then be released earlier and be able to vote, precisely because they were considered to be a more serious threat to society than the other person, who was at liberty up to the point of their conviction. The anomalies that arise have to be resolved by ending the blanket ban.</p><p>That does not mean that we cannot have other approaches, such as leaving it to individual courts to decide, when they make sentences, whether someone has committed a crime that justifies the deprival of the franchise, or having a time limit of six-month sentences, which I have suggested, or the longer time limit that the Liberal Democrats have suggested. There are a range of alternatives to the blanket ban that would avoid some of the practical consequences.</p><p>There are also legal arguments, as we have heard. Article 3 of protocol 1 to the ECHR seems to specify elections. The wording refers to</p><p>&#8220;elections ... by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature&#8221;</p><p>and that has been taken to mean elections and not referendums. However, it leaves what the case should be for referendums entirely up to national Governments, and in this case a devolved Government. The Deputy First Minister takes the position of saying, &#8220;We support the ECHR and want to incorporate it into a written constitution for Scotland&#8221;&#8212;I agree with her on that&#8212;and she therefore accepts that a blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections is wrong, as that is not acceptable under the ECHR. Why, then, is there a desire to have a different approach to human rights compliance in respect of referendums than in respect of elections? The Government should advance an argument for that.</p><p>There are also caveats, which the information from Professor Tierney has made clear. For example, the referendum on the European Economic Community was deemed to be of a &#8220;purely consultative character&#8221;, and that is part of the reason why the ECHR ruling did not apply to it. There are legal arguments that indicate that the outcome of a challenge is unpredictable and not guaranteed.</p><p>Finally, there are moral arguments. Although I disagree with the Church of Scotland about many issues, such as the nature of existence, it argues clearly that the criminal justice system should have at its heart</p><p>&#8220;the aim of restoring broken relationships between the offender and the community&#8221;.</p><p>It states:</p><p>&#8220;Punishment does not seek to deny human dignity to anyone, but to restore it.&#8221;</p><p>That is the moral case, and the Government must also respond to that.</p>", "hdate": "2013-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22690779", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I echo the convener&#8217;s thanks to my fellow committee members, our clerks, our advisers and those who gave evidence.

I was happy to add my name to the motion.</p><p>Comment has been made on whether the issue is every bit as significant for the Scottish press and whether it reflects the operation of the Scottish press. Notwithstanding the agreement that exists across the political spectrum that the treatment of recently deceased people is an issue that needs to be taken seriously&#8212;I wish the cabinet secretary well as she continues to advocate to the UK Government the need for changes on that&#8212;it is true that the general culture of the press has shown up in worse behaviour south of the border than in Scotland. However, even if we acknowledge that, I do not think that such differences matter very much in considering what regulation is necessary for the press.</p><p>It is not enough to point to the now defunct News of the World and say that Scottish titles were not responsible for the worst of this deteriorating culture. The proposals for regulation must be about the future. Of course, we must learn lessons from the past and ensure that the regulation is informed by past conduct, but the proposals need to be about the future. The proposals for a new regulatory regime must be right for the industry as it is, rather than for the industry as it has been over recent years.</p><p>We have two competing versions of a royal charter: one from the UK Government and one that was published more recently by the industry. Frankly, I thought that it showed a bit of nerve for the industry to come up with a rival royal charter, which seemed to imply that it has a rival monarch and a rival privy council to which it can present its rival royal charter.</p><p>The differences between the two documents are important. The industry&#8217;s proposal contained no democratic check at all on future amendments to the charter. We have heard from Bob Doris and others about the importance of whistleblowing arrangements, but that was another aspect that was deleted from the industry&#8217;s proposal.</p><p>If the industry&#8217;s proposal was followed, I would have a clear expectation that, very soon after the new regulator was up and running, the same old practices would resume and we would go back to business as usual. The executive summary of the Leveson report describes some of those practices. Paragraph 34 states:</p><p>&#8220;there has been a willingness to deploy covert surveillance, blagging and deception in circumstances where it is extremely difficult to see any public interest justification.&#8221;</p><p>In pursuing targets of investigations who might be unwilling or find it unwelcome,</p><p>&#8220;the virtue of persistence has sometimes been pursued ... to the point of vice, where it has become (or, at the very least, verges on) harassment.&#8221;</p><p>What beautiful understatement.</p><p>The report mentions door-stepping, chasing by photographers and persistent telephone calls, and I am sure that members from across the spectrum could add to that list of unwelcome and unacceptable practices. In the absence of a whistleblowing arrangement, as the industry wishes, I am sure that many of those practices would continue and that people who are perhaps unwilling, such as junior members of staff on papers, would be unable to resist the pressure to participate in those activities.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689722", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Press Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is very much to be welcomed that we have reached consensus on the recognition of a responsibility to act in devolved areas&#8212;it might have been politically easier to duck the issue&#8212;to the extent that we have been able to lodge a motion with the names and support of all political parties.

Volume 2 of the Leveson report&#8212;at paragraph 8.37, if anyone wants to look it up&#8212;talks at great length about the treatment of minority groups as well as women in many aspects of the press. For example, it cites the treatment of Muslims and refers to</p><p>&#8220;a Daily Star article entitled &#8216;Poppies banned in Terror Hotspots&#8217;, which suggested that a ban on the sale of Remembrance Day poppies had been imposed in certain Muslim populated areas, where no such ban existed&#8221;.</p><p>It also refers to</p><p>&#8220;A Daily Express article entitled &#8216;Muslim plot to kill the pope&#8217;, which reported on a non-existent plot&#8221;</p><p>and</p><p>&#8220;A Daily Mail article entitled &#8216;Cafe wins fight to fry bacon after Muslim complaints&#8217; which implied that complaints to a local authority which had sparked enforcement action ... had been made by Muslims&#8221;,</p><p>when that simply was not the case.</p><p>Leveson cites many other examples of appalling treatment of transgender people, welfare recipients and asylum seekers, which is something that members in this Parliament, particularly those who represent Glasgow, which has a high proportion of asylum seekers, should take very seriously. He concludes:</p><p>&#8220;Overall, the evidence in relation to the representation of women and minorities suggests that there has been a significant tendency within the press which leads to the publication of prejudicial or pejorative references to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or physical or mental illness or disability.&#8221;</p><p>The suggestion that the industry would close down the opportunity for third parties to represent the interests of those who, for a range of reasons, are often unable to represent themselves by bringing a complaint is appalling.</p><p>It is important to mention that free speech and the freedom of the press are not the same thing. Free speech is a right that we expect to be able to exercise as citizens and individuals. It is not the same as the freedom of big business making huge amounts of money, in some cases, by exercising an extremely powerful platform in society. Both those freedoms matter but neither is absolute. All freedoms in society have their limits, and the breadth of those limits should matter to us all.</p><p>Freedom for serious investigative journalism is crucial, but even the more heavily regulated broadcast journalists have shown that it is possible to pursue serious investigative journalism. How important do we really think it is to have the freedom to turn people&#8217;s private lives into salacious public gossip, to malign whole sections of the community and undermine the compassion that people feel for one another in our society, or to abuse and misuse scientific truth?</p><p>I thought that Stewart Stevenson was going to comment on this following his opening remarks, but anyone who heard the Daily Mail journalist on &#8220;Question Time&#8221; the other week trying to defend that newspaper&#8217;s abysmal treatment of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination issue heard about one of many examples in which the misuse and abuse of scientific truth has cost lives and put others at risk. Such issues should be actionable. It should be possible for third parties to make complaints.</p><p>Any other industry would simply expect to be regulated by Government. If self-regulation is to be given one more chance to succeed, the press must make a genuine attempt. I urge the UK Government to hold its ground and pursue its own version of the royal charter. I give my support to the cabinet secretary in pursuing the amendments for which the Parliament has argued.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22689722", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Press Regulation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I must admit that I have not read the Official Report of the committee&#8217;s proceedings, but I will do so.

Regardless of the problems with the economy and the state of industrial relations in the 1970s, it is clear that if we look at human wellbeing rather than gross domestic product, 1976 was the high point; 30 years of the post-war settlement and the operation of a welfare state resulted in that historical high point. However. after 30 years of centre-right economics, there is now a growing gap between the rich and the poor&#8212;or between the rich and the rest. We have never since approached that level of human wellbeing.</p><p>I agree with Ed Miliband, who told the Labour Party conference that a new settlement is needed. I believe that we are more likely to achieve that new settlement if we bring to Scotland the powers on welfare, taxation and everything else, but across the divide we should agree that the principle of reform must be about restoring, rather than about dismantling, the ethos of the welfare state, and it should be about winning again, from first principles, the argument for it&#8212;which has, sadly, been lost in recent years.</p><p>Simplicity, less bureaucracy and less stigma are all good things to aim for, but to implement reform at the same time as making vast cuts to the scale of the welfare state is to pursue a wrecking agenda.</p><p>On alternatives, my party will continue to argue for an idea that had a degree of support at the time but which, sadly, the Beveridge report dismissed: the citizen&#8217;s income, which is a universal benefit that would remove at a stroke the poverty trap and the benefits trap that so many people are in. As well as being a dramatically simpler system to administer, it is redistributive&#8212;it would leave many people in the middle on roughly the same income, but people higher up the income scale would pay more. It would close the gap between rich and poor.</p><p>There is also the question of mitigation in the shorter term. Annabelle Ewing said that that question was all about power, but that is only half right. It is partly about power&#8212;absolutely&#8212;but it is also about the will. There is complete agreement between Annabelle Ewing and me about bringing those powers to Scotland, but we also have to have the will to exercise them right now. I was disappointed that in respect of the problems of the bedroom tax, which I think were most clearly articulated by Iain Gray, there has not been willingness to take mitigation measures, such as using a higher band of council tax for the most expensive properties. That has been described by the Scottish Government as robbing Peter to pay Paul. Well, that is what tax and benefits are all about; they are about deciding who is going to contribute and who is going to receive.</p><p>Alex Johnstone asked us who will pay more. I will put up my hand&#8212;I should be paying more. Every member in this chamber is in the top 2 per cent of incomes. We should be paying more&#8212;to be frank, a lot more&#8212;tax than we do at the moment. Tax honesty is also crucial to the future of this debate.

The debate is intended to provoke some meaningful reflection on that political legacy, and I am glad that a compromise on timing was possible to ensure that all are able to participate.</p><p>In proposing a debate without a motion and with a title that I regard as every bit as open to interpretation as the quote to which it refers, we hope that Parliament will focus on the ideas more than the person and that the approach will allow all sides to contribute to the debate as they see fit.</p><p>So, what of that legacy, the ideas that Margaret Thatcher embodied and the impact that they have had? Members across the chamber may pick on many particular aspects, such as the direct economic damage of deindustrialisation, the requirement to support the communities most directly affected that was given little more than lip service, or the economic and social impact of those changes that still, even now, echo through the generations.</p><p>I have received correspondence to suggest that, as a Green politician, I should welcome the closing down of polluting energy intensive industries. In reality, of course, they were not closed down but offshored, often to countries with greatly inferior social and environmental standards.</p><p>Some members might reflect on the homophobic policy of the Government of that day. In her 1987 conference speech, Margaret Thatcher complained that children were being taught that they even had a right to be gay. A year later, section 28 was introduced, which was the first homophobic legislation for many generations.</p><p>Some may focus on the disgraceful stance taken in relation to many international issues&#8212;for example, the treating of General Pinochet as a friend and the describing of Nelson Mandela as a terrorist.</p><p>Others, I am sure, will focus on the implacable opposition of the Thatcher Government to permitting Scottish self-government of any kind, even if some people think that that opposition ultimately helped galvanise the movement to create this Parliament. There are no doubt other aspects of her treatment of Scotland, from her using it as a test bed for the poll tax to her commitment to stationing Trident here against the popular will, that will be addressed.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688868", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Society"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I say at the outset how pleased we all are that there is such a strong turnout from all parties.

I have the whole 27-odd pages of the original interview in front of me. We do need to understand what was meant. Mrs Thatcher said:</p><p>&#8220;I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand &#8216;I have a problem, it is the Government&#8217;s job to cope with it!&#8217; or &#8216;I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!&#8217;, &#8216;I am homeless, the Government must house me!&#8217; and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.&#8221;</p><p>The implication of the quotation, even in context, is profound. The implication is that the Government should not accept a responsibility to provide housing for the homeless and that it should not provide grants. In today&#8217;s context, we have just seen the Government here provide a grant&#8212;taxpayers&#8217; money&#8212;to KPMG, a very profitable company, to enable it to make more profits from helping other companies pay less tax. I venture to suggest that Margaret Thatcher might have been proud of such a grant rather than condemning it.</p><p>To say that there is no such thing as society is justified only if we are reductive to the level of being metaphysical, at which point there is no such thing as the market either, only the individual spending decisions of people; no such thing as culture; and no acceptance of any collective aspect of human existence. This is what the debate comes down to: the tension between, on one hand, the common good and, on the other, the ideological obsession with private interest and the culture of selfishness and greed that grew up because of it.</p><p>Much of the economic legacy was based on the theft of past and future generations&#8217; assets, such as the selling off of the social housing built up by previous generations; the promoting of a consumer spending boom funded by the release of private housing assets through equity release; and the burning away of finite fossil fuels regardless of the consequences for other generations.</p><p>The statement that &#8220;there are only individuals&#8221;, which implies that there are only those who are here right now spending money and casting votes, is utterly opposed to the idea of intergenerational equity that I hope that people today value.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688868", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Society"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank Margo MacDonald.

Intergenerational equity, or equity between and within generations, was lacking. That undermines the collective nature of ourselves as human beings.</p><p>I have been told by others that I should congratulate Margaret Thatcher and her Government on an understanding of climate change. To be sure, that Government was among the first Governments in this country to even speak that term. To avoid demonisation and give credit where it is due, I point out that Margaret Thatcher as an individual was a trained scientist, and I am sure that she understood the scientific principles involved. However, the Government at the time continued its commitment to an economic model that drove the problem.</p><p>That economic model says that private ownership of everything must take precedence and that common ownership and public ownership are burdens to be jettisoned in society. The model promotes a continual dependence on a level of economic growth that outstrips the ecological resources that are available to us, whether they are finite energy resources or the planet&#8217;s carrying capacity. The resource depletion and the economic and social injustice that arise because of it can be traced absolutely to the economic model that was pursued, which turned every resource not into something to be cherished or nurtured but into a pure financial value to spend now, regardless of unfair distribution. The model ignored the externalised costs on society and the environment.</p><p>That analysis might strike some as overly partisan&#8212;a Green analysis&#8212;but even on its own terms the record of the Thatcherite economic model fails. It is certainly nowhere near the economic success story that some would have us believe. The Government enjoyed a windfall boost to the economy of some &#163;70 billion from North Sea oil and a fire sale of public assets, from major industries to the housing stock. Those privatisations were, of course, were extremely profitable for the City of London and represented a vast transfer of wealth from public to private hands. The Government did not so much flog off the family silver as flog off the family home and then rent it back.</p><p>What did that achieve? Unlike what happened in countries that invested resources for the long term and now share the benefit for the common good, resources were frittered away. There was barely 2 per cent annual growth, even in GDP terms, over the period of Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s time in office, unemployment reached 3 million, and there were deficits in all but two of her 11 years in office.

As Mike MacKenzie hinted, there is the tension between legal compliance and risk aversion, which can be the two ends of a spectrum. There is also a tension with regard to the interests in which procurement and competition law operates. Does such law operate in the public interest and the interests of the common good or does it simply serve private sector competitors&#8217; interests? Can it genuinely benefit the wider common good?</p><p>There is a tension between legislation and culture change. Do we need one to drive the other? Can they be self or mutually reinforcing? Moreover, there is the tension that the Deputy First Minister highlighted between giving small businesses in Scotland opportunities through procurement legislation or the approach to procurement and the value-for-money priority. As several members have argued, value for money must not&#8212;indeed, it cannot&#8212;simply be seen in terms of direct financial transactions. That kind of reductive approach, which sees only the part of the economy that shows up in money terms, is at the heart of a great number of our current economic problems. If such procurement decisions create unintended consequences that undermine public policy or the common good, we cannot really call cheapness value for money.</p><p>All those tensions were highlighted back in 2007 when the Green Party lodged a motion on green procurement for debate in the chamber. We asked the then Executive to produce guidance that had not previously existed on what were new EU rules; although the directive had come into force a year before, no guidance had yet been issued. If I remember rightly, the Government added that guidance to its website the evening before the debate, so progress was made even before we got to the chamber. However, we also called for a mandatory requirement for sustainable procurement criteria to be added to public contracts. Again, the tension between a mandatory or legislative requirement and culture change arose, and we argued that one can drive the other.</p><p>Members have mentioned a wide range of criteria that they would like to be included, and I agree with the comments from Labour members about wanting as many of them as possible to be specified in the bill. Those criteria might include environmental performance, which can be measured in a range of ways, from waste production to CO2 efficiency per unit of output, and ethical aspects such as trade justice and issues that I have discussed with the Minister for External Affairs and International Development, Humza Yousaf, about whether it is appropriate for public bodies to bring in wider international matters and, say, boycott particular products as a result of the situation between Israel and Palestine. I note that many local councils have on ethical grounds begun to move away from Eden Springs for the provision of water in their buildings.</p><p>In addition to greater specificity in environmental and ethical matters, we need to consider economic justice arguments, which do not stop at the living wage and include blacklisting, which has been mentioned, and wider positive engagement with the trade union movement, which I hope that we would all like responsible employers to support. We should also address zero-hours contracts and the very exploitative employment model that they represent.</p><p>How much more radical do we want to get? Perhaps we should look beyond the living wage by exploring maximum wage ratios and seeking to ensure that not just the public sector but the private sector reduces the gap between the richest and the poorest in our society. All that, and a range of opportunities for employee participation, could be specified in legislation.</p><p>The Deputy First Minister might well say that it would not be possible to do that, even in a future iteration of the EU legislation, but I will make a suggestion that I hope that she will respond to in her closing speech. If we cannot specify all the things that I have mentioned, can we ensure that there is a mandatory requirement for generic criteria under which a company that is bidding for a public contract would have to demonstrate economic justice and which would allow the Government to have regard to the living wage, zero-hours contracts, union recognition and worker participation?</p><p>I have looked at the correspondence between the European Commission and the Government on the living wage, and it appears to me that the question has been about that issue specifically rather than something more generic. The Government should respond to that.</p><p>I call for strategic intention to be specified in the bill so that, as the EU rules change not just this year but in the future, local procurement decisions are made with the greatest possible duty to make the most allowable use of sustainable, ethical and economic justice requirements in all future contracts.</p>", "hdate": "2013-04-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22688659", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Public Procurement Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I thank the committee for bringing the debate to the chamber.

My party&#8217;s policy is in favour of independence and my personal view is strongly in favour of it, but we have members on both sides of the constitutional debate. That is because we are not defined by the issue. We are defined far more by our economic policy and the idea of the economy as a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. It is therefore perhaps unsurprising that my take on the debate will be a wee bit different.</p><p>John Swinney told us that Scotland is a prosperous country, and I agree. The difference is that I probably mean something a wee bit different by the word &#8220;prosperity&#8221;. I want us to ask what we mean by a word such as &#8220;prosperity&#8221;. That might sound like an abstract concept, but it is one of the big ideas that Margo MacDonald urged us&#8212;rightly&#8212;to focus on earlier. It is one of the most important questions facing the world.</p><p>I think that the First Minister took Joseph Stiglitz&#8217;s name in vain earlier in relation to corporation tax, but Joseph Stiglitz is one of the leading advocates of a more holistic approach to the economy and of a recognition that wealth is not limited to financial wealth. Prosperity is not limited to the question of whether we are a little bit richer or a little bit poorer. I and my party will never reach a view on independence that is based simply on the richer-or-poorer blizzard of factoids.</p><p>How do we value and measure prosperity? Jim McColl and Brian Souter might look at their corporation tax bill and decide that they feel more prosperous if they get to keep more of their profit, but our society will not prosper from the inequality that grows as a result. It will prosper if we share our material wealth more fairly.</p><p>Where do Scots place their priorities? What makes them feel that they have what they need to live a decent life? What makes them feel that they can prosper as human beings?</p><p>The Oxfam humankind index asked people those questions. If we look at the priority that people give to the factors in their lives that give them a sense of security and a sense that they have what it takes to prosper in life, we will see that having an &#8220;Affordable, decent and safe home&#8221;, &#8220;Physical and mental health&#8221;, a clean environment, and &#8220;good relationships with family and friends&#8221; are important. We have to look halfway down the list in the index before we get to &#8220;Having enough money to pay the bills and buy what you need&#8221; and &#8220;Having a secure source of money&#8221;. That does not make those things unimportant, but it means that other factors are more important to people, and we should think about them more profoundly when we ask ourselves what prosperity means.</p><p>Oil has been talked about a great deal. There is the idea that oil is a great economic asset. It is potentially an economic asset, but it is also potentially the source of economic ruin. The oil and gas industry&#8217;s value is based on the known reserves that are available, and there is the idea that all those reserves can be turned into economic revenue, but that is not true. The world knows that we have many times more fossil fuel reserves than we can afford to burn. If we expect to continue the environmental conditions that allow us even to run an economy, we will have to leave a lot of those reserves where they are, or we will destroy the conditions that allow us to operate an economy. There is economic value in the oil and gas reserves, but it will be realised only if we restrain our use of them&#8212;otherwise they will not give us prosperity.</p><p>We talk about jobs and whether we can create new jobs from new industries, but jobs are not the same as prosperity. Many people will argue that having a job gives a person dignity and that having a source of income gives a person the things that they need for quality of life. However, low-waged jobs that are subsidised through the welfare state, jobs that are time pressured and jobs that undermine people&#8217;s health and social capital can take away people&#8217;s prosperity. Jobs that are well paid, jobs that are more equally paid between the highest and lowest in a business, and jobs that are family friendly, stimulating and rewarding generate prosperity.</p><p>I urge everybody on both sides of the independence debate and on all sides of the economic debates that we face to think more deeply about what we mean by wealth and prosperity.

I have a great, passionate love of the quality food that is being produced in Scotland, of which we should&#8212;rightly&#8212;be proud. I can therefore understand why many of the speeches have focused on people&#8217;s pride in the quality produce that comes from Scotland.</p><p>However, there is a really serious problem if we mistake a debate about food policy for a debate about food manufacture at the quality end and if we ignore the issues about the food that is consumed every day in every community around Scotland. If we forget those issues, we are in danger of failing to recognise that the context is that of a food system in crisis.</p><p>I regret that, in the last few seconds of his speech, Alex Johnstone chose to misrepresent the Green Party&#8217;s record on raising the issues around the food crisis in which we are living. We were the first to raise a debate about green procurement in the Parliament and the first to raise a debate about the overweening stranglehold of a handful of multinational supermarkets that dominate the retail sector. Everybody recognises that those issues should be addressed&#8212;and that they should have been addressed more successfully years ago.</p><p>It is perhaps more galling that, before he misrepresented our position, Alex Johnstone decided to base part of his argument on statistics that were lifted directly from a Green Party press release. However, I will ignore that barefaced cheek for a moment. The staggering part of his speech was when he used the example of McDonald&#8217;s as part of the answer to the problems of our food system in crisis. We should be staggered by the idea that the answer boils down to, &#8220;Let them eat Big Macs&#8221;.</p><p>Rob Gibson held up an advert that I think was from Sainsbury&#8217;s&#8212;it was from one of the big supermarkets. I hope that, like me, he is a wee bit tired of hearing from the supermarkets&#8217; marketing departments about the need to restore trust.

That revision is required as soon as is reasonably practicable after the failure to meet the target has been announced, but here we are in January and no revision has yet been made.

Despite the fact that we will disagree on the future that we want to see for the industry, I hope that everybody in the chamber would come together in paying tribute to those who work hard to protect the safety of people and of the environment.</p><p>I want to give credit where it is due to the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government has a clear focus on its renewable energy targets and I have consistently welcomed that. For the first time last year, we saw a &#163;1 billion investment in renewables in Scotland. There is high confidence that the 100 per cent target for 2020 can be achieved and that there will be big increases for the marine sector after that so that we can export efficiently to help to decarbonise Europe&#8217;s electricity production.</p><p>However, that is not the whole story in terms of decarbonising our energy system. Renewables cut carbon emissions only if they replace fossil fuels. We need to reduce demand. Not only investment in renewables is necessary if we are serious about climate change, but disinvestment in the high-carbon industries and sadly the current minister seems not to agree with that. Indeed, since he took on the job I have only ever really noticed the fire come into his eyes when he talks about another 40 years of oil and gas extraction in Scotland.</p><p>Under the Scottish National Party Government, there has been an increase in opencast coal extraction, a relaxed attitude to unconventional gas, coal-bed methane and fracking potentially, support for deepwater drilling and now an oil and gas strategy that is focused on squeezing out every last drop from the North Sea.</p><p>I refer members to the document that I mention in my amendment, the International Energy Agency&#8217;s &#8220;World Energy Outlook 2012&#8221;, which concludes that</p><p>&#8220;no more than one third of proven fossil fuel reserves can be consumed&#8221;</p><p>prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the goal of constraining climate change to 2&#176;C unless carbon capture and storage technology is widely deployed. As I mentioned earlier, CCS cannot be deployed in relation to uses of fossil fuel for transport and heating, for example, which is where most of our oil goes.</p><p>The International Energy Agency is generally a conservative body&#8212;it is not where we would look to if we wanted to find an overly alarmist approach. The next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report seems likely to focus minds on just how much tougher the 2&#176;C target is than was previously thought.</p><p>There are three ways of resolving that contradiction. One is to say that domestic production is necessary in order to reduce our reliance on imports. Pretty much every country that has any fossil fuel to extract domestically will use that argument&#8212;indeed, they are using it&#8212;with the result that nobody budges and we carry on putting more fossil carbon into the global economy and therefore into the atmosphere.</p><p>The second option in response to the contradiction is to say that we need to continue our reliance on fossil fuels for a while to bridge the gap before we transition properly to a genuinely low-carbon economy. That argument boils down to saying, &#8220;Lord, make me chaste&#8212;but not yet.&#8221; In fact, it does worse. Increased production will help tendencies to keep prices down, so it will delay the transition towards the low-carbon economy that everybody says that they want.</p><p>The third argument is the one that the minister used. CCS is talked about as the essential technology to take fossil carbon back into the ground after we have consumed fossil fuels. As I have made clear, we cannot apply that approach in relation to the fossil carbon that comes from the oil industry. That is simply not an option.</p>", "hdate": "2013-01-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22680996", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Oil and Gas Sector"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I like to begin with a note of consensus when I can&#8212;Alex Johnstone looks sceptical already.

Although I will not vote for the Labour amendment, I take Iain Gray&#8217;s point in our earlier exchange. The transition that we should be trying to make from the abuse to the use of science and from policy-based evidence to evidence-based policy presents serious challenges for all of us. My party&#8212;the wider movement that I feel part of&#8212;has not always taken a science-led argument. I hope that Iain Gray would agree that on most issues, including GM and nuclear power, the most ardent geek activist would not argue that only scientific arguments can be put forward; economic arguments also matter.</p><p>As well as challenges for my party, there are challenges for all in this debate. In particular, I flag up the experience of Professor David Nutt, sacked by the previous UK Government for the crime of simply holding drugs policy to scientific scrutiny and challenge&#8212;by a Government that had commissioned advice from the Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs after having decided what it wanted to do. It sought advice after making a decision.</p><p>I also flag up to members a book that I have found instructive in recent months&#8212;&#8220;The Geek Manifesto&#8221;. Liam McArthur might have misrecognised the book as he walked into the chamber; it is a book and it is orange, but it is not the book that he was thinking of, although I will maybe give that a go one day. &#8220;The Geek Manifesto&#8221; seeks to articulate the political objectives of a movement that has grown up and which could, if it plays its cards right, become one of the most significant single-issue campaigns to develop in recent years, by establishing a group that focuses on the role of science in policy.</p><p>The book has a great deal of constructive suggestions to offer. Marco Biagi mentioned randomised controlled trials. The book goes into great detail about how such trials are fundamentally different from the pilot schemes that we run on existing policies. Randomising a controlled trial of education policy would present challenges, but would taking a randomised controlled trial approach and generating useful data be less justified than imposing a new policy because we think, after putting a finger in the air, that it will probably work, although we find later that we have to run an assessment to justify it rather than to find out information?</p><p>At their heart, the book and the agenda seek scientific input before decisions are made, whether on climate change, the wider environment, transport or health. Stewart Stevenson mentioned the alcohol debate, which I argue has been quite poorly conducted in the Parliament&#8212;for example, last-minute amendments were proposed in the chamber to the then Licensing (Scotland) Bill on the basis of political posturing rather than years of consultation and evidence. In the previous session, we saw the unedifying spectacle of the Government and the Opposition suggesting useful and constructive changes to alcohol policy and arguing against each other&#8217;s policy suggestions, each without the clear weight of evidence behind them.</p>", "hdate": "2012-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22679523", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Role of Science in Public Policy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I very much welcome the debate, which should be about what science has to say about policy rather than what policy has to say about science.

A debate like this should attract similar howls of outrage.</p><p>Not so long ago, Parliament debated the living wage. We debated the concept and the fairly simple assertion that people ought to be able to expect a decent income to live on that affords them a standard of dignity. During that debate, we acknowledged that many people in this country who live on out-of-work benefits are on incomes that are so low as to result in a degree of poverty that we should regard as unacceptable. However, many asylum seekers in this country live on just about half that amount, if they are lucky. As Mrs Fee mentioned, very often that is provided not even in cash but through a card that must be spent only in certain outlets.</p><p>A wee while before that, we debated a call from international development non-governmental organisations that challenged us to attempt to live, as so many of the world&#8217;s poorest people do, on the equivalent of $2 a day. I think that a former First Minister, Jack McConnell, took up that challenge and made an effort to live in the UK on that meagre income.</p><p>&#8220;Destitution&#8221; is a word that should have such a powerful impact. Destitution means absolute levels of poverty way below what we think is acceptable for people who put in a day&#8217;s work, way below what we think is acceptable for people who are out of work and way below the outrageous levels of poverty that exist around the world and in which so many hundreds of millions of people live. Destitution is having nothing. There was a time when people in the UK talked about destitution as being something that is deserving of sympathy and charity&#8212;as an unhappy circumstance that people might fall into. Very often, what people got&#8212;&#8212;I am talking about a time before the welfare state&#8212;was charity rather than change in society that would eradicate that destitution.</p><p>In this debate, destitution means something different. It means a deliberate act of Government policy; that has to be remembered. This is not destitution as a merely unhappy circumstance about which we can do nothing and that affects those few poor souls who have fallen through the net. This is destitution as a deliberate act of policy. Let me quote the Home Office document from 2007 that has been provided in the briefing to all members:</p><p>&#8220;For those not prioritised for removal, they&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>that is, refused asylum seekers&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;should be denied the benefits and privileges of life in the UK and experience an increasingly uncomfortable environment so that they elect to leave.&#8221;</p><p>That is Home Office policy from 2007.</p><p>Destitution, in that circumstance&#8212;for asylum seekers and those who have been refused asylum in the UK&#8212;is a deliberate act of Government policy. How outrageous that is, in its own right. Even if that policy was successful&#8212;Linda Fabiani has demonstrated that it is unsuccessful in achieving its objective&#8212;rather than just imposing destitution on people, it forces them to choose between destitution and the return to an environment in which they fear for their lives. Either circumstance is a moral outrage, and we should hear louder howls of outrage in the chamber than those we heard over another issue less than an hour ago.</p><p>I know that not all members will agree with my next comment, but my hope is that one day we will see an asylum system in place in Scotland that is based on compassion and whose purpose is to provide asylum to those who need it, instead of the system that the UK Government operates, whose purpose is to say no to the maximum numbers possible.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22677820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum Seekers (Destitution)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As others are, I am grateful to Linda Fabiani for securing the debate.

Alex Neil responded to that criticism by saying to Labour, &#8220;You supported the council tax freeze as well, so how dare you criticise it?&#8221; There were some of us who said, before the election, that the council tax freeze was unsustainable, and the Government must still answer that point. If the council tax freeze continues unabated and if the Government continues with its policy of sticking with council tax, despite the fact that its majority in the chamber gives it an opportunity to replace it with something fairer, and comes to the next election&#8212;with whatever range of powers we have at that time&#8212;with a commitment to cut corporation tax as well, services and benefits will suffer as a consequence.</p><p>Although there is little in the Government&#8217;s motion that I disagree with, I lodged an amendment to delete the end of it, because independence is not the only way in which to protect public services and universal benefits. I will be voting and campaigning for a yes vote in the referendum because I think that it offers more opportunity than risk, but it offers no guarantee. The way in which to protect those services and benefits is to raise taxation from those who are able to pay.</p><p>There is not much that I disagree with in the Labour amendment, either. My only regret is the lack of a clear position.

It got closer than most, though. He kept saying that we must get this right but then he talked about the need to plan disinvestment. That contrasted with Sarah Boyack&#8217;s speech, which critiqued the way in which the SNP makes comparisons with Norway without being honest about Norwegian levels of taxation. We need to be honest about both, and we need to stop talking in terms of a fixed budget. Right now, even with the existing powers that we have under the current devolution settlement, we could empower our councils to raise taxation in progressive ways&#8212;if we only had the political will. That would enable us more accurately to compare ourselves with Norway&#8212;a country where the biggest part of people&#8217;s individual personal taxes goes to their local communities and smaller shares go to the regional government and central Government.</p><p>I will not be supporting the Conservative amendment.

Why is there no call for a long-term assessment of the costs of business support services or grants to the private sector from the Scottish budget; of the value, dubious though it is, of the small business bonus; of the inequality between rich and poor in our society and the poverty impact of the UK Government&#8217;s welfare cuts; or, indeed, of the scale of tax avoidance by the wealthiest in our society?</p><p>The phrases &#8220;something for nothing&#8221; and &#8220;free services&#8221; have riddled this debate. We need to be honest about the fact that free services are not free; they are paid for on a collective basis. We choose to pay for those services in that way because we make a judgment that our society is better off, collectively, when we do so.

I have been happy to support their long-standing efforts on this issue on many occasions, and I look forward to continuing to do so.</p><p>It should be unarguable, in our wealthy society, that the exchange of work for a wage implies a basic minimum, acceptable, liveable standard. The idea that poverty pay still continues to keep people in a position in which they are in effect being subsidised by the taxpayer because they are dependent on in-work benefits is extraordinary. Other members have mentioned how extreme the situation is with regard to poverty pay, even with the existence of the minimum wage. The rate that has not been mentioned is that for 16 and 17-year-olds, which, in nearly a decade, has gone from &#163;3 an hour to only &#163;3.68. Of course, the real minimum minimum wage, for apprentices, is more than &#163;1 below that.</p><p>The idea that a working week should allow a basic, acceptable standard of living should be such a little thing to ask for. It should be seen as a modest proposal, and a decent society should ensure that that happens. However, sadly, it is regarded by some as something inflammatory. Some of those who will argue that market conditions do not allow us to have the living wage are the same people who say that market conditions imply that they, on six or seven-figure incomes, should get a little bit more every year&#8212;and a little bit more, and a little bit more.</p><p>I was struck by Ian Bell&#8217;s comments on the living wage in today&#8217;s Herald, although the headline might have been a bit disappointing to some of the campaigners. In the piece, he says that the living wage</p><p>&#8220;encourages some employers to do the least they can get away with, and then boast of the fact&#8221;.</p><p>I think that he is arguing that the living wage is necessary, but not sufficient. He is quite right to say that, if we want a more equal society, we need to look at pay at the top end, not just eliminate poverty pay at the bottom end.</p><p>Some of the same people who tell us that a living wage is unaffordable are those who have awarded themselves 27 per cent increases on already inflated incomes. To argue that market decisions make that a necessity and dictate those choices for them is breathtaking hypocrisy.</p><p>Margaret Thatcher once said that there is no such thing as society. Some have defended her by saying that what she meant was that society is made up of individuals and individual choices. Well, so are markets. There is no such thing as market forces; there are only the decisions of&#8212;in this instance&#8212;individual employers. For some of the most major employers in our country to argue that market forces determine that there must be inflated salaries at the top and poverty pay at the bottom, while their decisions are the decisions that set those market conditions, is breathtaking hypocrisy, and we should have none of it.</p><p>As well as addressing top pay and the living wage, we must go further, as John Wilson says, and consider our entire welfare state, including out-of-work benefits. If the living wage is necessary in order to achieve the basic acceptable standard of living, we must recognise that people on out-of-work benefits are living in breathtaking poverty and, in the current circumstances, do not have the ability to do much about it.</p><p>I thank John Park and Kezia Dugdale once again for making this an issue that will come back to the chamber time and again.</p>", "hdate": "2012-11-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22676142", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage Week"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I thank Kezia Dugdale for lodging this motion and John Park for opening the debate.

It took until Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s speech towards the end of the debate for a Labour member even to acknowledge that revenue raising needs to play a role in the debate.</p><p>I agree with Annabelle Ewing about cancelling Trident, but I have listened to so many excellent, barnstorming lefty speeches about cancelling Trident that I have heard the money being spent a thousand times. It will not pay for everything.

It is a question of what we choose to pay for collectively. We choose to pay for things collectively because we are better off collectively if we do so. However, such services must be paid for on that collective basis. If this is a real debate, I call on both sides of it to agree that the one thing that we must do in this parliamentary session is to free the hand of local government to raise the revenue that it needs in progressive ways, as soon as possible.</p>", "hdate": "2012-10-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673958", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scotland&#8217;s Future"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree with the central premise that the Labour Party is putting forward, which is that it is not possible to show a commitment to a series of universal benefits and to high-quality public services while showing an instinct to cut every tax&#8212;in short, as Johann Lamont put it, a commitment to Scandinavian levels of public service and United States levels of tax.

I hope that members will agree that it does not stop us coming to the chamber and getting our point across by spending six minutes ranting about how wrong you all are. However, most members who have spoken in the debate are at least partly right, and there is a measure of agreement about the standard of service that we want to achieve, even if there is disagreement about how to get there.</p><p>The minister began by talking about the vital role of public transport. I have heard him speak before about the standard of service that he wants Scotland to enjoy: high-quality, reliable, affordable, and low-carbon. If that is what we want to achieve, the first thing that we must do is acknowledge quite how far away from having that standard of service we are at the moment, particularly when it comes to buses. As other members have done, I will start by offering a local perspective. In many parts of the country, we have highly expensive and unaffordable services&#8212;many people in Glasgow find it cheaper to get across the city in a taxi than in a bus. We have unreliable services and services that are often of poor quality.</p><p>I lay a lot of the blame for that problem at the door of the free-market approach. I agree with Iain Gray that, if we are to address the wider issues and the ability of bus services to meet carbon emission objectives, as well as social priorities across the country, we need to look at the structure of the industry. At a recent Confederation of Passenger Transport conference, Brian Souter&#8212;who will be known to members&#8212;said that the reason why the free-market approach is right is that it does not really matter whether a bus company tries a new service and it fails, because the company can scrap it. It really does matter that the industry has the power to set up services that people become reliant on, only to have them pulled like a rug from under them.</p><p>In relation to the disagreement between Mark McDonald and Elaine Murray about funding and how honest the debate about it is, I acknowledge that I would love to see bus services getting more subsidy; I do not think that &#8220;subsidy&#8221; is a dirty word. However, even if people do not want to get into a debate about subsidy, they should consider the fact that, at the moment, the profitable parts of the industry are entirely in the hands of the private sector and the costs of the less profitable parts of it&#8212;the socially necessary services&#8212;are picked up by the public purse. Moreover, many of the ticket sales on those profitable routes are also being funded by the public purse, yet we leave the profitable parts of the industry in private sector hands.</p><p>There has been much talk about CO2 emissions and particulate pollution. Just yesterday, there was another report from the European Environment Agency about NO2 emissions from road transport in Glasgow. When I was elected in 2003, it was pretty clear that Glasgow&#8217;s air quality was among the worst in the United Kingdom. With this year&#8217;s report, it is clear that Glasgow&#8217;s air quality is among the worst in the whole of Europe. Another 10 years of drift will not fix that. If we look at pictures of Hope Street or Renfield Street at any busy time of day, we see buses and cars struggling to get through the same crowded road space and inching their way through the city.</p>", "hdate": "2012-09-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22673387", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Green Bus Fund"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will begin with self-deprecation.

They may have a timetable, but it is not publicised. Even at the best of times, First in Glasgow has what I would call an ambiguous relationship with timetables. Such parasite services hover about a stop ahead of the service that is run by First or whichever company is the dominant provider. They charge a bit less than the dominant provider, but the services are provided using vehicles of extremely poor quality. That is a hugely inefficient part of the industry. If we are to reduce carbon emissions, we must look at vehicle efficiency not just in terms of the number of vehicles that compete for particular routes, but in terms of how they are powered.</p><p>The Scottish Government&#8217;s response to yesterday&#8217;s figures has been contradictory. At one point, the statistics on NO2 pollution were dismissed, with the Government saying that it did not recognise them. Today, however, it is clear that the Government has asked for an extension to allow Scotland to achieve the targets.</p><p>The green bus fund is a step in the right direction, but in the context of there being more than 5,000 buses, it is a very wee step. We need to attract more passengers on to the services, which means that we need affordable fares, reliable good-quality services, and a public-service ethos for public transport. We also need measures such as car-free hours and we need to examine WWF&#8217;s proposals for a congestion charge and other demand-management measures.

Those changes are just about enough for me to vote in favour of the motion.</p><p>I will also happily vote in favour of Rhoda Grant&#8217;s amendment. However, I would honestly have preferred a debate that allowed the full expression of the serious concerns that exist about the direction in which the UK Government is taking electricity market reform. My amendment, which was not selected for debate&#8212;members will have to turn to the back rather than the front of the Business Bulletin if they want to read it&#8212;set out some of those concerns, including about demand reduction and the favourable context for fossil fuel and nuclear generation that will be set. The amendment also set out the proposals for a decarbonisation target and a Scottish emissions performance standard.</p><p>It is pretty clear that the direction of EMR will set the agenda for a dash for gas and new nuclear power stations. In its briefing, Scottish and Southern Energy states that the contract for difference</p><p>&#8220;is a &#8216;one-size fits-all&#8217; support mechanism which is suitable for nuclear, but not for renewables&#8221;</p><p>or carbon capture and storage.</p><p>&#8220;The latest design proposals actually increase, rather than reduce, risks and costs for renewables developers&#8221;.</p><p>WWF Scotland has expressed similar concerns. It notes that</p><p>&#8220;The Scottish Government ... has a commitment to ... a &#8216;largely decarbonised electricity ... sector by 2030&#8217;&#8221;,</p><p>and it calls for such a commitment for the whole UK to be included in legislation.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson referred to the letter from the UK Committee on Climate Change that was published today, which calls for a carbon intensity target for the power sector to be included in legislation. The committee states:</p><p>&#8220;Extensive use of unabated gas-fired capacity ... in 2030 and beyond would be incompatible with meeting legislated carbon budgets.&#8221;</p><p>It also criticises the</p><p>&#8220;apparently ambivalent position of the&#8221;</p><p>United Kingdom</p><p>&#8220;Government about whether it is trying to build a low-carbon or a gas-based power system&#8221;.</p><p>We should take those concerns seriously.</p><p>We should look at the option of an emissions performance standard for Scotland, which WWF has suggested. The UK Government&#8217;s proposal is set at such a high level&#8212;at 450g of CO2 per kilowatt hour&#8212;that it will lock us into high-carbon energy generation and another generation of fossil fuel power stations for years to come. The House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee called that proposal &#8220;pointless&#8221; and said that it could endanger our effort to meet our climate change targets.</p><p>Under existing devolved powers, the Scottish Government has the power to develop a Scotland-specific EPS that is consistent with Scotland&#8217;s priorities and Scotland&#8217;s greater ambition, on which we kept congratulating ourselves when we debated the climate change legislation. If we are serious about that ambition, let us set a serious emissions performance standard.</p><p>As well as gas, there is the threat of new nuclear power stations&#8212;the organisations that I quoted have suggested that. Some might say, &#8220;If England wants to do that, that is its affair&#8212;Scotland already has the position that we won&#8217;t have new nuclear in Scotland.&#8221; However, the reality is that we will still be part of an integrated electricity market and that the cost of the immense subsidies for nuclear power will be borne by consumers in Scotland, too. From our position of opposition to new nuclear stations in Scotland, we must challenge the UK Government&#8217;s position.</p><p>I support the comments by Mary Scanlon and Iain Gray about storage. It is clear that a more renewable electricity supply will need more storage. Greater incentives should be provided for the creative investment that is needed.</p><p>I am sorry that the votes on the motion and the amendment tonight will not allow us the opportunity to record those criticisms. It is important that the Scottish Government continues to make the case for change in its discussions with the UK Government. It is also important to remember the context in which that is happening&#8212;that of the UK Government&#8217;s appointment of Owen Paterson and John Hayes to positions of importance to the subject.</p><p>I draw members&#8217; attention to the comments by Roger Harrabin of the BBC. Since those two gentlemen were appointed, he has repeatedly asked the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and DECC whether those men accept the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, on which UK and Scottish climate change policy is based. He has not had a reply and he says:</p><p>&#8220;DECC press office simply ignore the question, whilst a source at Defra told me it wasn&#8217;t a priority for Mr Paterson to answer&#8221;.</p><p>Both those men have spoken out strongly against wind power and have at least flirted with climate change denial. If they pursue the dash for gas and a new nuclear agenda at the expense of renewable energy in the UK or in Scotland, George Monbiot is right that their appointment represents</p><p>&#8220;a declaration of war on the environment&#8221;</p><p>by the Prime Minister.

While equal marriage for same-sex couples is by no means the only important aspect of his new job, it is certainly one of the most anticipated and I look forward to seeing him give the same clear leadership that we all know the issue needs.</p><p>Paul Wheelhouse has another urgent job to do. The Government missed the first annual target under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 this year. He must not only get back on track but exceed the next annual target if he is going to make up for the lost time. If the Government is remotely serious about turning a set of targets from paper commitments into real-world delivery, he will need to be the minister who champions the radical action that has been ducked up to now. The first test will be whether the forthcoming report on policies and proposals under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 is bold and fully funded in the budget. I urge him to ensure that both those documents are presented to Parliament together to allow the scrutiny that he agreed was necessary when he signed up to the Finance Committee&#8217;s report on last year&#8217;s budget.</p><p>I also welcome Joe Fitzpatrick to his role but I hope that he will forgive me if I direct my final comments to Bruce Crawford.

The Government is clearly committed to, and is making progress on, the reindustrialisation and renewables agendas, but still seems to be quite comfortable with that industry remaining overwhelmingly in the hands of big business, and with passing up the opportunity to keep a share of it in community or public ownership.

I have been as vocal in my criticism of the current Government&#8217;s transport policies as I was in my criticism of its predecessor Labour-Liberal Administration, which pursued much the same agenda.</p><p>Although some of the issues require more powers in order to address them, many of them can be worked on right now. The procurement bill, for example, has been mentioned and John Park is quite right to say that we should be challenging&#8212;not accepting&#8212;the status quo of EU rules. We should be seeking from procurement not just value for money, but value to society, and we should be making economic justice arguments for, say, the living wage, maximum wage ratios and tax justice commitments, and placing barriers on companies that use tax loopholes and exploit tax havens and still expect to win public sector contracts.</p><p>We should be looking at localism to ensure that public sector money&#8212;taxpayers&#8217; money&#8212;continues to circulate in the local economy and we should also be considering sustainability and ethics to ensure that we take into account companies&#8217; track records in dealing with regimes that have abysmal human rights records. Of course, we might not be able to be absolute on those issues, but we must push at the very limits of EU procurement law if there is the slightest chance of getting the momentum to change it. It remains to be seen whether the Government has the will to do such things.</p><p>I would be concerned if, as one counter-indication, the better regulation bill simply became a deregulation bill at the behest of big business that is looking to safeguard its own interests. Bus services are one area where better regulation would very clearly mean stronger, not weaker, regulation. I could name other examples.</p><p>Those and other questions are about the kind of Scotland that we want to build. Another example that has been highlighted and which deals with a similar question is the same-sex marriage bill; I certainly add my voice to those of Johann Lamont, Willie Rennie and others in welcoming the bill and wishing Nicola Sturgeon well. I believe in her commitment to a bill that I welcome very strongly.</p><p>Ruth Davidson said that she looked forward to an open and respectful debate when we come to the bill&#8217;s scrutiny. Well, that would be a nice change, wouldn&#8217;t it? Sometimes we do not quite manage to achieve that tone of voice in our debates, so it would be a positive move if we could do so on this issue. Whether one comes to the bill from the point of view of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality and giving same-sex relationships the same equal rights, dignity and status as mixed-sex relationships, or whether one comes to it from the point of view of religious freedom, I believe that one must reach the same conclusion. Religious freedom does not exist in Scotland on this question; if we wish to extend such freedom, we must add our support to the bill.</p><p>We should go further. I do not understand why the cabinet secretary has said that mixed-sex civil partnerships will not be supported. If same-sex couples are to have the right to choose whether to cohabit, to enter into a civil partnership or to marry, why should mixed-sex couples not have that same choice? Such questions are questions about the kind of country that we want to build.</p><p>That brings me to our constitutional future and to what will perhaps be the most important period of debate in modern Scottish political history. I have said it before and I will say it again: both sides need to bring a positive vision to the debate. If those of us who seek a yes vote in the referendum can articulate a compelling and transformational vision, we have a chance of convincing the so-far-unconvinced, but there must be room for substantive debate&#8212;on tax, welfare, defence, a written constitution, human rights, robust parliamentary scrutiny and even an elected head of state. I have no interest in being told that those are matters that will be debated after the referendum. I have heard that too often.

A number of those aspects were addressed in stage 1 discussions and in stage 2 amendments, and it became clear that the Government had decided that it was determined not to budge on those issues.</p><p>I will address the idea of including a target date for completing the land register. If we believe the assertion that the bill&#8217;s principal policy objective is completing the land register, it is odd that the bill does not include a target date&#8212;even an indicative target date&#8212;as is set for a host of other policies, such as the eradication of fuel poverty.

I live in and represent a city in which about half the residents do not have access to a car. Bus services are fundamentally important as a means of getting about, for me and for many other Glaswegians.</p><p>The context of the debate is the period just before a local government election, so temperatures are a wee bit higher than they might normally be and the debate is a wee bit more contentious than it should be. I commend Kezia Dugdale for making the point, in her intervention during the minister&#8217;s speech, that the debate should be about the people who rely on bus services and about the impact of changes in service levels and prices&#8212;and other factors&#8212;on the people whom we represent and serve.</p><p>What is wrong with the current situation? Members have talked about prices. The 27 per cent increase in the short hop fare in Glasgow was mentioned; the even bigger increase in child fares means that if a family wants to get from one side of Glasgow to another it is often cheaper to go by taxi than by bus. Is not that astonishing? Should not that shock us into action, given that many of the people who do not have access to a car are the least well-off in our society?</p><p>There is a host of things that we could do in relation to the reliability of services and the provision of information&#8212;even before we start debating regulation&#8212;to improve the quality of the bus service that people can access. Another issue is the lack of a voice for bus passengers. Passenger Focus, for example, has no remit in representing bus passengers in the way that it does train passengers.</p><p>Why do we have such a poor quality of provision? A fundamental part of the problem is the free market approach. Jim Hume rightly said that the bus companies exist to make a profit and not to run a quality, affordable service&#8212;that is not their objective. I know that there are individuals working in the companies who are personally committed to public transport as a public service, but the companies&#8217; free market approach will not deliver that.</p><p>We can look back at the process of deregulation and recall the remark that was attributed to Margaret Thatcher&#8212;it might be apocryphal; I am not sure&#8212;that is, that any man who finds himself still using the bus by the age of 30 can consider himself to be a failure. Whether or not Margaret Thatcher said that, it is very much part of the ethos of deregulation and what has happened since then that buses are perceived as the option of last resort, at the bottom of the list of priorities.</p><p>Lack of regulation is an issue, as is the lack of finance and subsidy, which means that it is more expensive to go by bus than by train and sometimes even by taxi. There has been a failure to prioritise bus services and there has been a lack of consistency. However, we need to be honest about the political dynamic that is in play, too. I do not expect the Labour Party or the SNP to agree that when parties are in opposition, it is easy to call for regulation and that when parties are in government, it is easy to say no, or to admit to doing that. Both parties have swapped their positions over the years.</p><p>I think that part of the reason for that is that passengers do not have a strong political voice. Who here thinks that the motoring lobby is not a strong political voice in the UK and in Scotland? Bus passengers do not have that strength of voice and I believe that, if we are to change the political dynamic, it is important for them to act together to bring their collective voice into the debate. That is the idea behind the better buses website that I recently set up.

Many people have mentioned the option of having an Oyster card-style system in Glasgow or across Scotland, which should be a priority of the Scottish Government and should not have been shelved for the duration of its present period in office.

I was reflecting on the unerring wisdom of &#8220;Yes Minister&#8221;&#8212;pretty much every day we come across something on which &#8220;Yes Minister&#8221; had it right. There is a scene in which the minister is being driven by his chauffeur, George, who says that he was listening to a chap on the radio who said that the problem with health, education and transport was that ministers and civil servants all went to private hospitals, sent their kids to private schools and went to work in chauffeur-driven cars. The minister scoffs. George observes that it would be a bit different if the minister and Sir Humphrey had to go to work on the number 27. The minister replies that that would be quite impractical. George says that the minister would have to make the bus services a lot more efficient. &#8220;Of course we would,&#8221; replies the minister. George responds by noting that that was what the chap on the radio said. George&#8217;s point was well made.</p><p>We should not think of bus services in the way that George Adam seemed to think of them, as things that are of concern only to older people and disabled people. He seemed to have the idea that bus services are about the lowest common denominator and that they are an option of last resort. That is not good enough. We deserve a higher standard of service.</p><p>The SNP&#8217;s main policy response to the debate has been to emphasise the idea of a fuel duty regulator. The introduction of a fuel duty regulator in the context of a quite reasonable expectation that energy costs and oil costs will continue to rise globally would simply result in ever-declining revenue from fuel duty, which would mean lower public spending, whether on public transport or anything else. A fuel duty regulator is not sustainable in the long term; it would simply give a bit of tax back to anyone who burned fuel. It is not a reasonable response economically or environmentally.</p><p>I would like to respond to Alex Johnstone&#8217;s speech. He made some important points; principally, he asked where the money would come from to finance bus services or to regulate them. It is a matter of priorities. There is always another &#163;1 billion to throw at the road-building programme, and there is always money available for tax cuts for the wealthy, whether in the form of the SNP&#8217;s policy on corporation tax cuts or of the UK Government&#8217;s decision to give a tax cut to high earners. The issue is whether we choose to prioritise bus services.</p><p>Alex Johnstone talked about market failure. Competition has done some good things&#8212;it has had some benefits&#8212;but it has failed some people very badly. Patricia Ferguson said that there was a lack of democratic control and accountability when it came to the delivery of bus services.</p><p>Alex Johnstone&#8217;s other main point was that the Government, or the taxpayer, was becoming the biggest customer in the bus system. That is absolutely unsustainable. It is quite right that we should pay for bus services on a collective basis because they are best provided on a collective basis to meet public interests. That is not the problem&#8212;it is a vital aspect of public services; the problem is that we underfund for the standard of service that our constituents deserve and that we do not specify the standard of service that we expect them to receive. We provide neither the necessary funding nor the regulation.</p><p>I will close by reading out a few more comments from bus passengers in Glasgow who have sent in their views to my website. The first one will particularly appeal to Alex Johnstone. Its author said:</p><p>&#8220;The fight for Better Buses means a fight for a socialist alternative.&#8221;</p><p>We might not all use that language. They went on to say:</p><p>&#8220;Bring the bus companies back into democratic, public ownership, accountably run under one umbrella organisation.&#8221;</p><p>Another passenger said:</p><p>&#8220;Catching a First Bus from Shawlands Cross is like Russian roulette&#8212;you never know if it will change drivers at the Larkfield Depot and if it does, whether the replacement driver will turn up.&#8221;</p><p>Another person said:</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent a winter waiting for buses, or so it seems. The timetables ... seem like a work of complete fiction.&#8221;</p><p>A stream of people said that they had taken their complaints to FirstBus but had been fobbed off.</p><p>That is not good enough. We should all agree that the standard of service is inadequate and that services are underfunded and overexpensive, and we should do something about it.</p>", "hdate": "2012-04-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22665106", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Bus Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I endorse the member&#8217;s suggestion, but a short-term fare drop will never be sustainable unless taxpayer funding is there to make it so.

For some reason I usually end up with the confrontational one&#8212;I cannot think why that might be.</p><p>Today, we are doing it a little bit differently. We genuinely hope that the motion on local energy companies, like the motion on cycling, can move forward an argument on a cross-party basis. There should be political support from across the spectrum for local energy companies.</p><p>I begin by mentioning Jonathon Porritt, who spoke at the opening of the Scottish Renewables conference this week. He can speak the language that an audience full of professionals will readily understand while saying something really revolutionary. He said:</p><p>&#8220;We are in the very early stages of the most radical transition in the history of mankind&#8221;,</p><p>and set out a vision of a 2020 target of 100 per cent equivalent of our electricity consumption coming from renewables, and a longer-term vision of an entirely renewable future. The Scottish Parliament should be proud of its commitments on climate change and renewables, but in those &#8220;very early stages&#8221; of the transition, we are missing a trick.</p><p>That transition or transformation in our energy system will require a huge amount of work and, no doubt, many will see it as an opportunity to make a lot of money&#8212;indeed, that is happening already. To be sure, the private sector has a central role to play, but the Greens have brought the debate today to develop the case for keeping a share of this new, growing industry in the hands of the public and communities, and to call for the Government to take a more proactive approach to ensure that that happens.</p><p>If we do that, two of the many benefits that could be achieved go way beyond the renewable energy targets alone: it would generate revenue for public services; and it would build public support for an important industry that can be made to serve the common good. The transition that we seek and need will take place only with public support, yet there is a growing perception of private sector profiteering. Sometimes that perception is accurate, and sometimes it is needlessly fuelled by those who are opposed to the action that we have to take on climate change.</p><p>The profits of the renewable energy industry are certainly significant, as is the contribution made by the public through taxation and energy bills. The danger is that a reaction to that situation will prevent us from making the transition to a sustainable energy future that we need to make. It does not have to be that way. We can build public support by sharing the economic benefits of the industry.</p><p>Revenue could be generated for local authorities and other parts of the public sector, which could have huge benefits. I was recently at a site at Laurieston on the south side of Glasgow&#8212;next to the Citizens Theatre, for members who are familiar with that area&#8212;where a huge amount of housing is about to be built. Some of it will be social housing, and some will be private sector housing and therefore for sale. That is exactly the kind of area where, if the public sector could make a bit of extra investment, we could build in transformational technologies using really low-carbon and genuinely passive housing standards and microrenewables to achieve a long-term energy supply for the community. With the power of the public sector, we could generate energy, yet we do not do such things because local authorities do not think in that way.</p><p>That said, there are some examples of local government trying to develop models. I will run through a few of them. Perhaps the most familiar example to members of this Parliament is Aberdeen Heat and Power, which is a not-for-profit company that was set up by Aberdeen City Council 10 years ago. The carbon emissions from the buildings involved have been reduced by about 45 per cent, and typical fuel costs to tenants have been reduced by more than 50 per cent.</p><p>Down south in Woking, Thameswey Energy Ltd, a company that is wholly owned by Woking Borough Council, aims to promote energy efficiencies, develop new technologies, produce and supply energy and acquire and hold interests in other companies. The council recently set up a joint-venture company, as it recognised that a wholly owned public company is limited by some of the constraints on capital controls that are imposed by central Government. Therefore, the different model of a joint-venture company has been adopted.</p><p>In Islington, the Bunhill energy centre is investing in local energy generation and reducing energy costs to households and businesses, as well as the carbon footprint. Sheffield has one of the largest district energy networks in the United Kingdom. It started out serving just a few buildings and now serves more than 140 buildings, reducing carbon emissions by about 21,000 tonnes every year. I do not have time to read through all the examples that I have, but there are similar schemes in Bristol and Norfolk and elsewhere in England and Wales. However, very little is happening in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664588", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Energy Companies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When the Greens bring motions to the chamber for debate, we usually take what we laughingly call a soft-and-spiky approach.

There should not be insistence, but there should be strong and compelling leadership at local and central Government level, in which the minister has a crucial role. I am slightly disappointed by the Government amendment, which deletes significant aspects of the motion that detail the role that local energy companies could play.</p><p>The Government amendment discusses a document that has been produced by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Futures Trust. I have seen the draft of that document, which was dated June 2011, and which was on the Scottish Futures Trust website. Just yesterday, the final version, dated August 2011, was added to the website. It is encouraging that my motion led to at least some action being taken before I even got to my feet to speak. However, if the Government does not proactively give leadership on the issue and does not even put up information on the website, we will not make progress. In conversation with my office yesterday, the SFT was keen to emphasise that no local authority has produced proposals recently, but that is no great surprise if the leadership is not there and information is not being circulated.</p><p>The forms of support that are needed from Government include financial support. As Kevin Stewart mentioned, such support has been given. We also have the renewable energy investment fund, which was announced last week and which will have elements of district heating and community renewables within its remit. We need to define the term &#8220;community&#8221; clearly because of the wide range of models that I talked about and the different balance of cross-party support in local authorities for different business models. Some promote wholly owned companies, some tilt more towards the private sector, whereas others prefer co-operatives, community interest companies or social enterprises. All those models are good, but they all need leadership if they are to happen.</p><p>As well as financial support, leadership needs to be about bringing together skills and experience and building partnerships to ensure that local authorities can make progress. At present, local authorities have a difficult balancing act just to provide basic services.</p><p>A report back from Government to Parliament on the issues would be of great benefit, so I am happy to support the Labour amendment. We need a proactive approach from Government on the issues, and a report back would certainly help to keep them on the agenda. Even better would be a commitment to a number of projects that could be developed during this parliamentary session. Shortly, Scotland will elect councils for another term in office. By the time that the councils that we elect in May have completed that term, the natural and default situation for every single one of them should be that they are working with a local energy company of one model or another&#8212;wholly public, a partnership, a co-operative or whatever. Different councils will find different solutions that are appropriate for their areas.</p><p>It would be bizarre&#8212;it would be unthinkable&#8212;if, in a few years&#8217; time, local government did not see itself as having a role in public investment, not only in energy efficiency but in renewables.

I am delighted to have spread a little joy around the chamber this morning.</p><p>Liam McArthur highlighted the importance of demonstrating not only new technologies but how the industry can be turned to the common good and mentioned the community benefits that have flowed from the 14MW of projects in Orkney. I very much hope that, as part of its inquiry into the renewable energy targets, the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee will be able to visit Orkney and learn not only about the exciting marine developments on the islands but about equally important work focusing on the role of the community.</p><p>Fergus Ewing mentioned the 500MW target for community and local ownership and said that, instead of communities simply being the recipients of cheques, the best model was community ownership. However, the term &#8220;local ownership&#8221; is still a wee bit ambiguous. Local ownership by small businesses is not a bad thing. It is a good thing, but it is different from what we call for in the motion, which is community and public ownership. The minister said that he is uncomfortable with some of our arguments about local energy companies becoming suppliers. I am grateful for the offer to discuss the details with him or with officials&#8212;I will certainly take that up&#8212;but he placed a great deal of emphasis on the barriers. What we need is the will to overcome those barriers. I do not pretend that doing so will be easy or that we can do it with a snap of the fingers, but the political will needs to be there to do it.</p><p>Let us talk about something that we could do that might take us halfway in that direction. I give as an example a project in the Netherlands that I did not have time to mention in my opening speech. It is called&#8212;I know that I am going to mispronounce it&#8212;met de stroom mee. Apparently, the rough translation is &#8220;go with the flow&#8221;. It involves the registration of 10,000 households who have agreed to let the project negotiate on their behalf directly with the energy companies. Using the bulk purchasing power of that many households, the project went on to secure bids from energy companies at a much lower cost per household than the average that they had been paying before. Such a project in Scotland would not go all the way towards what I am talking about, but it would certainly have a role to play, whether it took place in the private sector, the public sector or under a social enterprise model.</p><p>I restate the perception that I had when I visited Laurieston in Glasgow, which I mentioned in my opening speech. The investment that could be put in from either community or public sources to enable local energy generation or district heating is only going to be there if there is some means for the people who make that investment to get it back, and if they were able to become the supplier of energy to the community, that would enable them to do that. I am sure that there will be financial risks&#8212;the minister emphasised those&#8212;but we are also passing on a massive financial gain from the industry, and the private sector is surely not the only game in town. I hope that we will not be sceptical about the basic proposition of local energy companies and that we will move forward with the proposal.</p><p>Many members mentioned projects in their communities, more in the sense of community ownership than public ownership, whether that is Dennis Robertson bringing Finzean to the chamber or Mike MacKenzie speaking poetically about Gigha. Mike MacKenzie also suggested that I have an implied antipathy to business. Not at all. I was clear in my opening speech that we recognise the central role of the private sector, but if the renewables agenda is a common endeavour, as Mike MacKenzie described it, we need a sense that the benefits are shared for the common good. I want a renewable future for Scotland, but it would be a shallow victory if it led to yet another generation of increasing economic inequality in our society.</p><p>I am grateful for the general sense that we can do much more to progress the agenda. I am sorry to say that there is a growing perception that support for renewables is a matter of supporting big business on one side or big egos on the other. It does not need to be that way. The renewables transformation will fail to secure real social benefits and a fair share of the economic benefits throughout our society, as well as the vital achievements on climate change, if we do not question the ownership structure and not just consider how quickly we can achieve the targets.</p><p>I am grateful to members for their contributions to the debate, and I look forward to further discussions with the minister on the issues.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22664588", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Energy Companies"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I certainly agree with the point about transmission charges, although I continue to be sceptical about the big society concept.

We should be asking, and the minister should be able to say, how complete the register can be expected to become and how quickly, and whether it will be possible for it to be completed without greater use of keeper-induced registrations. There is currently a presumption against the use of keeper-induced registrations. For how long can that go on? Do we expect to achieve 50, 60, 80 or 90 per cent completion of the register? Will the final 5 or 10 per cent of the register be completed without the use of induced registrations? There is a role for targets, as the committee recommended in its report.</p><p>Andy Wightman&#8217;s contribution to the debate began with the observation that the bill has been presented as a largely technical bill, yet it represents the first opportunity that a democratically elected Scottish Parliament has had to consider the legal basis of land registration in Scotland. His position is that opportunities might have been missed to engage with wider issues of public policy and public interest, some of which have been mentioned. How should we deal with abandoned land? Should we simply continue&#8212;albeit with slight restrictions&#8212;the prescriptive acquisition process, or do we need a more public process to ensure that other parties who may have a legitimate interest can express it and have it considered? It may well be that there is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and that different means of disposing of land that has not had an identified owner will be appropriate in different circumstances. I would like to hear the Government&#8217;s view on that.</p><p>Several members, including Rhoda Grant, have mentioned common land. I am glad that the committee supported the in-principle objective that Andy Wightman has sought to achieve, and the objective on access, because we are not doing as well as England and Wales at providing easy and affordable access to land register information.</p><p>The most significant issue that I want to address is beneficial ownership. Andy Wightman&#8217;s view is that registration should be conducted by a European Union-registered body. There are other views. Andy Wightman cited Andrew Edwards&#8217;s mentioning of the need for disclosure of the true or beneficial owners of registered properties in cases in which they differ from the nominal owners.</p><p>With the bill, we have a real opportunity. I recognise that, at the moment, neither the Scottish Parliament nor the Scottish Government has the power to deal with issues such as tax avoidance, but the land registration scheme can act to close such loopholes. Tax avoidance and the use of tax havens have been fundamental mechanisms for the accumulation of wealth by the few against the interests of the many. We have the opportunity, through the bill and through public leadership from the Scottish Government, to say that that is not acceptable and that action will be taken to close those loopholes. The committee&#8217;s report asks the Government to consider the options, and I look forward to hearing some detail on the minister&#8217;s consideration.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662970", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Land Registration etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I strongly commend Rob Gibson for much of what he said.

We united over the underlying principle political parties that often fall out over other issues and wind each other up. We were not always united on how we wanted to implement the 2009 act or on how we would get to the low-carbon future, but we were united on the principle and on the objective of reaching that future. If the Parliament unites on today&#8217;s motion and, I hope, on the amendments, we will have done something even more interesting. We will be a Parliament that brings together political parties to recognise that we need to make radical change in the way in which we run our economy, and to take responsibility for that globally.</p><p>Scotland has a historical responsibility as one of the countries that created the modern world and the enlightenment. In coffee shops and taverns up and down the Royal Mile, people put together the ideas that underpinned the modern world and the industrial revolution. We bear a responsibility for the beneficial consequences as well as the harmful and destructive ones. We have an historic opportunity to live up to that responsibility&#8212;not to wait for global action, but to lead it. If we can unite on a motion that discusses that responsibility in climate justice terms, that will be significant, and I welcome the Government&#8217;s motion.</p><p>The human rights approach that is mentioned in the motion is important. I welcome the support for that debate from Mary Robinson and Alan Miller, which the minister mentioned. I think that they understand not only the present but the future challenges around the world, of food, energy, population, health, migration, the impact of climate change on economies&#8212;not only domestic national economies, but local economies&#8212;which cannot be avoided, in whole or in part, and their resilience to climate change, which will be happening, as well as attempts to address the underlying poverty and inequality.</p><p>The paper from the Scottish Human Rights Commission that was circulated to members before the debate calls for a human rights impact assessment to go alongside an environmental impact assessment. We should endorse that call.</p><p>I am glad that the motion is not too self-congratulatory about Scotland&#8217;s track record; rather, it is aspirational about the role that Scotland can take on. Before we live up to those aspirations, we have far more to do domestically on energy, transport, and food. Too often our priorities benefit those who are already doing okay, particularly when we look at how we spend our money in Scotland. They benefit those who are already able to consume the energy that they wish to consume, to eat the food that they wish to eat, and to travel in their chosen manner. We place a much lower priority on those who do not have those options. Globally, the trade and competition rules that are imposed by the wealthy countries, which all too often benefit the wealthy countries, perpetuate unsustainable energy use and inequality around the world.</p><p>The two specific items that I included in my amendment are the adaptation fund and consumption-based targets. I welcome the minister&#8217;s commitment that the Scottish climate justice fund will be launched soon. I encourage him to use his closing speech to give us a little more detail about what that fund will involve. It must be additional to what the Scottish and United Kingdom Governments are doing on international development, and it must be informed by an equalities and human rights analysis, including the gender analysis that the minister mentioned in his speech. It must also support locally led projects. Any private sector additions to the fund must not be seen as an offset or an excuse for those companies that contribute to take less action on mitigation. I encourage the minister to endorse those principles in his closing speech.</p><p>On consumption-based targets, one of the changes that was agreed to during the passage of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 was the inclusion of a duty on ministers to produce a report for each year from 2010 to 2050, setting out, as far as reasonably practicable, the greenhouse gas emissions that are produced by or otherwise associated with the consumption and use of goods and services in Scotland.</p><p>The three aspects of our responsibility on climate change are the emissions that we produce in Scotland; our consumption, or offshored emissions; and the extraction. If we dig up the fossil carbon, it will end up in the atmosphere. We will have to address all three of those aspects. The legislation achieves the first; consumption targets will achieve the second; and the third will be for later debate.</p><p>In closing, I again welcome the debate and the concept of adaptation debt proposed by the World Development Movement, and I ask the minister to say something about what he regards as Scotland&#8217;s share of that debt. Not included in my amendment, but highly relevant, is the question of how to fund all this action. I urge the minister to give the Scottish Government&#8217;s support to a measure such as the Robin Hood tax, which would allow all countries around the world to make their contribution fairly, from both private and public sources.</p><p>I move amendment S4M-02156.2, to insert at end:</p><p>&#8220;, and calls on the Scottish Government to announce a timescale for the creation of a Scotland-wide climate adaptation fund as outlined in the SNP manifesto and for the development of a system of consumption-based reporting targets as specified in section 37 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009&#8221;.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When the Parliament united to pass the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009&#8212;a good piece of legislation that brought together all sides of the political debate to vote yes when it came to the moment&#8212;we did something that very few other jurisdictions had been able to do.

We should probably admit that we have a bit more fun with a good old-fashioned argument in the chamber, but the debates in which we unite on a piece of text, and in which we all agree consensually and make speeches that reflect the other excellent contributions across the chamber are interesting.</p><p>Dennis Robertson was the first member to point out that consensus is not always absolute. As we have heard, there is a good consensus on the ambition, just as there was in the debates on the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill. There is consensus on not just the scale of the ambition but its range, which incorporates a human rights approach, and there are attempts to reclaim the term &#8220;human rights&#8221;, which has sometimes been co-opted by the right wing in politics and turned into a bogey-man term. Members have also endorsed the need for poverty and inequality to be at centre stage in the climate change debate, and the need for a scale of moral responsibility.</p><p>There has been criticism on some of the specifics: about precisely which emissions targets are set; about the balance between road building and active travel, which several members mentioned; about whether to keep Scottish Water in the public sector, as I believe we should, but which Jim Hume questions; about the role of nuclear power in the energy mix, which Jamie McGrigor questioned; and about the delivery of environmental justice and the relevance of the Aarhus convention, for which Mary Fee correctly argued.</p><p>Other issues have not been mentioned in the debate. For example, we heard little about the consumption targets that are mentioned in my amendment, although I hope that we will hear more about them in the minister&#8217;s closing speech. It is all too easy to talk about the progress that we have made towards a 42 per cent reduction based on a 1990 baseline, but we have made progress because of the extent to which we have offshored emissions over the years. We are still consuming in much the same way. The consumption targets are necessary if we are to accept the full moral responsibility that so many members talked about in their speeches. I hope that we will hear something from the minister about the timescale.</p><p>Even in consensual debates after which we sign up to the text at the end of the day and pass a motion with unanimous support, there are sometimes ideas bubbling away under the surface that are contested, and assumptions that are not shared. Sometimes they bubble as fiercely as the most furious knife-edged budget debate of old, even though they are not so clearly spoken. Jamie McGrigor&#8217;s speech was a good example of that. He began strongly, talking about a human-centred approach, about the perception of climate change occurring right now, even in Scotland, and about a much sharper perception of that globally, and he restated his party&#8217;s support for the emissions targets that were included in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. He began so strongly with all that great consensual stuff, but towards the end, as Neil Findlay pointed out, we heard that free trade is the best way in which to achieve an end to poverty and inequality and to prevent climate change, and that preserving the environment must go hand in hand with economic growth. Those are contested ideas. From my point of view, a world that seeks to achieve climate justice and sustainability needs to challenge those ideas and find its way towards a new economic system.</p><p>Last Monday, the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and the Scottish Trades Union Congress held an event at which we heard much argument on that&#8212;some of it from Oxfam, which will soon launch the humankind index on which it has been working, and some of it from the Church of Scotland. As someone who is occasionally described as one of those dangerous and aggressive militant secularists, I aggressively urge everyone to read the report of the Church of Scotland&#8217;s commission on the purposes of economic activity. It comes from a different starting point to mine&#8212;which is not spiritual in any way&#8212;but I cannot disagree with its conclusion. It states:</p><p>&#8220;We have allowed elements of our social and economic system to degrade human beings and the environment instead of seeking a holistic approach to life. This is no time for business as usual. We need to put aside the argument that ethical principles are too idealised to put into practice or that economic practices are too unruly to be disciplined by principle.&#8221;</p><p>I urge members to read it.</p><p>We heard some of that agenda on Monday and Tuesday last week, but on Wednesday the committee heard from the Council of Economic Advisers how important it is that we get back to &#8220;business as usual&#8221; as soon as is humanly possible. There are still contested ideas. We are likely to agree on the text of the motion and the amendments to it, but beneath the surface there remain profound questions, which are as yet unanswered, about the scale of change in our economy, about our society and about our politics, which a climate change agenda and a climate justice agenda demand of us.</p>", "hdate": "2012-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22662107", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Ah, consensual debates.

Willie Coffey alluded to that at the end of his speech.</p><p>There are people who see that there are differences between forms of economic activity and that not all economic activities are the same and should be measured in the same way. Some forms of economic activity are driven by competition alone and the desire of a small handful of people to ensure that they serve their own interests come what may and irrespective of the impact on other people in the world around them. Then there is the co-operative model, which is very different from the competitive model. It is not the same thing, and it is not a subset of the same economic system. The co-operative model is about mutual aid and democratic accountability, local community links and&#8212;often&#8212;consumer empowerment. It provides something that is fundamentally different from the conventional business model.</p><p>My only regret is that the co-operative model is sometimes seen as being an alternative business model under an unspoken heading alongside other models such as mutualism and social enterprise. In reality, we should seek to make the characteristics that co-operatives demonstrate the default. We should aim to achieve an economy that shares those characteristics rather than simply think that a small number of co-ops can do their good work and we can congratulate ourselves on supporting them without transforming the rest of the economy. Members have talked about a range of sectors in Scotland in which co-operatives have demonstrated those characteristics well, such as the housing and food sectors. In particular, Jim Hume talked about cheese and beer, which are two of my favourite things in life. I could speak about them all night, but I will focus on energy and banking.</p><p>Sarah Boyack made points about energy that I would have made. The co-operative business model can have a profound role in energy in Scotland, both in respect of bulk buying it and providing it to individuals as the retailer. Local councils, the public sector and other business models could be doing that, but co-operatives could also play a really profound role, as well as generating energy from renewables and ensuring that the benefits of that generation come to and impact on the widest possible number of people, rather than seeing renewables as being under the control of a tiny number of massive multinational corporations.</p><p>I also want to talk about banking. It is no coincidence that, when we look around our neighbouring countries in Europe at those whose banking and financial services industries survived better than the UK&#8217;s did, we see much greater diversity. They have small banks and public banks, as well as co-operatives. Co-operatives have a role in this country, but it could be so much better. If they had a stronger role in the financial services sector in this country, we would not be debating whether to put a workers&#8217; representative on a remuneration committee, or the obscene pay ratios in some parts of the financial services sector, because that simply is not part of the co-operative ethos. That ethos should be celebrated where it exists and we should be learning from it to transform our entire economy.</p>", "hdate": "2012-02-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22661322", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Co-operatives"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like other members, I am pleased that we have the opportunity to debate the motion and I thank Helen Eadie for lodging it.

Perhaps not all of us have managed to do that during this afternoon&#8217;s debate, but I must admit that I often fail in that regard, and that has happened again today.</p><p>I will follow the same pattern I followed in the stage 1 debate by beginning by identifying some of the areas in which I welcome the Government&#8217;s position, before moving on to some criticisms. On housing, which I thought was to suffer one of the most serious budget cuts, I welcome the fact that the Government has gone a substantial way towards reversing the cuts, albeit that it is not reversing all of them. I look forward to seeing the detail on that. The devil will be in the detail; we will have to see the detail on the loans and equity schemes to find out exactly what will be delivered through the additional spending in that area.</p><p>On colleges, we have heard that the NUS is happy to welcome the reversal of the cuts to student support. Student support is an important issue and one that I raised with the cabinet secretary. I am glad that there has been a partial reversal in that area, too, and a repeat of the top-up.</p><p>However, we must accept that that is against the backdrop of a huge cut to the teaching budget. Although I am pleased with the change that the cabinet secretary has announced, I ask him to acknowledge that the cuts to the teaching budget will do great harm. We should not kid ourselves about the extent to which the college sector will be able to deliver in that context.</p><p>On active and sustainable travel, the response of Rob Gibson was breathtaking. Transport is an entirely devolved area of spending, so it is entirely within the Scottish Government&#8217;s power to decide to implement right now the manifesto commitment that the SNP went to the electorate with, which was that it would</p><p>&#8220;continue to increase the proportion of transport spending that goes on low-carbon, active and sustainable transport.&#8221;</p><p>That was the commitment, but what do we see? We see a massive increase in the road-building budget and cuts, cuts, cuts to the sustainable and active travel budget. In particular, the active travel budget will go from 1.21 per cent of the transport budget in 2010-11 to 1.03 per cent in 2011-12. In 2012-13, the figure will be 0.84 per cent and in 2013-14 it will be 0.79 per cent. We will see decrease after decrease after decrease in the proportion of the budget that is spent on active travel.</p><p>We are moving further away from the SNP&#8217;s commitment, and not closer to it. I would accept that it might take a few years to reach 3 per cent or 4 per cent, but that is where we ought to be heading instead of moving from 1.2 per cent to 0.79 per cent&#8212;we are moving in the wrong direction. It is entirely within the cabinet secretary&#8217;s power to reverse that right now. I would like him to answer the following question in his closing speech. If he is going to increase the proportion, to what will it be increased, and by when? We will not be fobbed off with a commitment that it might happen at some future date. Year after year, we see budget lines in the area decreasing.</p><p>I cannot support the budget on those terms.

I suspect that Hugh Henry will enjoy the second half of my speech more than the first, but I said that I wanted to mention some of the good things first.</p><p>I welcome the Government&#8217;s emphasis on the concept of the social wage: the idea that, taken across the piece, the range of interventions that are intended to make life a bit easier for people need to be viewed holistically. Although a great deal of work is needed to put flesh on the bones of the concept of the social wage, it is important.</p><p>I also welcome the retention of some of the policies that we persuaded the Government to adopt during the previous session, including the climate challenge fund and the universal approach to home insulation, which at one point was in danger of being scrapped in favour of a more means-tested approach. The evidence is very clear that the universal approach is the one that works.</p><p>However, to put it simply&#8212;and this is where Hugh Henry might start to agree with me more&#8212;it is clear that there is too much in this budget that I cannot support unless substantial changes are made. I have argued since the draft budget was introduced that changes are needed in several specific areas. The first is FE, in which&#8212;as many members have said&#8212;colleges and courses as well as student support must be protected. Secondly, in housing, we need a retrofit programme on the scale of the one that we have been calling for for many years now, and not just small-scale pilot exercises.</p><p>Full funding is needed for the Government&#8217;s programme on climate change&#8212;as set out in the report on proposals and policies&#8212;so that we do not move from a consensus on setting targets to a period in which delivery becomes an afterthought. We need funding for sustainable transport, not only because of the environmental benefits, but&#8212;as Malcolm Chisholm outlined&#8212;because of the economic and social benefits for communities, which is something that Government after Government has ignored.</p><p>Let us look at the briefings that we have received to see whether there is a clue about the Government&#8217;s record in some of those areas. NUS Scotland has highlighted the emphasis on FE and the commitments that have been made. It talks not only about the cuts overall, but specifically about a cut of up to 8.5 per cent in the teaching grant. I find it inconceivable that cuts on the scale that is proposed can be pursued without being felt very clearly in course quality and teaching hours, and in other areas such as student support.</p><p>On housing, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has emphasised the 30 per cent cut for affordable housing&#8212;which is one of the biggest cuts anywhere in the budget&#8212;against the backdrop of a &#8220;dire need for homes&#8221;. It also emphasises the opportunity to achieve better-quality homes and to meet the greater need for homes, and points to the role of the house building industry as one of the major employers of apprentices.</p><p>Shelter Scotland, the SFHA and others have formed the existing homes alliance Scotland to argue and continue to lobby for the type of investment in a retrofit programme for our housing stock that I have mentioned. The SFHA points out that the proposed budget for energy efficiency and fuel poverty&#8212;despite the retention of the universal house insulation scheme that I mentioned&#8212;is just &#163;65 million. That is a &#163;10 million cut from the previous year, against previous cuts in the year before that.</p><p>Stop Climate Chaos Scotland states that it</p><p>&#8220;believes that this Budget Bill fails to fund even the ... Government&#8217;s own plans to meet the legally-binding climate change targets&#8221;,</p><p>and it emphasises the retrofit programme and sustainable transport as means of achieving that. On sustainable transport, it states that the</p><p>&#8220;SNP manifesto commitment to &#8216;increase the proportion spent on ... active and sustainable travel&#8217;, funding to improve ... cycling and walking infrastructure is ... to be cut&#8221;</p><p>&#8212;yet again&#8212;</p><p>&#8220;by a third while ... the roads budget will increase by 16%.&#8221;</p><p>That cut is precisely the reverse of the SNP manifesto commitment.</p><p>I would like to have spoken about other areas, but I do not have time to mention the poverty truth commission&#8217;s words on kinship carers and its critique of the council tax freeze, or other issues.

Like Jackson Carlaw, I found myself a bit underwhelmed by this document, which rarely raises itself beyond the level of the glossy strategy documents of which we have seen very many. It has very nice pictures in it, but I am afraid that it never quite gets beyond that.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw can relax now, because the agreement between us ends there. I not only thought the document underwhelming, but found issues in it to object to. I should say, in case I do not shout loud enough at 5 o&#8217;clock, that I will be voting against the motion. That is mainly because of what I described as the central contradiction in John Swinney&#8217;s and the Government&#8217;s overarching economic policy&#8212;the idea of sustainable economic growth. The cabinet secretary says that the strategy is deliberately focused on economic growth, and that, for me, is its weakness. Mr Carlaw will happily tell me that polluting oil companies and money-grabbing healthcare companies are not doing those things simply because they are evil, but that they are contributing to gross domestic product. That is one of the problems with GDP as a measure of our success as a society. Cities are not only places where business owners get rich, or poor, but places where people live in communities, yet their interests do not show up in GDP or measures of economic growth.</p><p>There are some wrong assumptions in the document, particularly where it says, in the cabinet secretary&#8217;s introduction and elsewhere, that cities have higher carbon emissions per capita than other parts of the country. That may appear to be true if we use the conventional methods in the UK, which do not account for urban land in terms of carbon sequestration, but in reality urban land&#8212;parks, gardens, golf courses and so on&#8212;absorbs substantial amounts of CO2 that are not counted in the existing figures. If we also take into account the high-density housing such as tenement accommodation in many of our cities, it is clear that cities have lower per capita CO2 emissions than most of the rest of our country. There will still be huge challenges in reducing those emissions, and I do not want to underplay that.</p><p>The backing for growth showed up again today at question time when the Government talked about its backing for retail growth. I cannot help but see the contradiction between that and the objectives that are stated in the document about reducing waste output and energy consumption. I do not see how the two can be squared. That is a very serious problem, particularly for Glasgow&#8212;a city whose economic strategy seems to have been gambled on the basis of the phrase, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go shopping forever.&#8221;</p><p>Low-carbon and sustainable energy aspirations are stated throughout the document, but let us think about what we are building. I visited the company that intends to build Laurieston&#8217;s transformational regeneration area&#8212;the new buzz phrase. I hope that it will get the planning permission that it needs for that, because truly high-quality housing is very much needed on the site. However, when I ask people what they are doing to build sustainable housing for the 21st century, the answer is, &#8220;Well, it meets the building regs.&#8221; If we are remotely serious about building differently, and powering our cities differently, we need to start right now with community heating, CHP, and a host of new technologies that are not being put in place. There is nothing to prevent local authorities, if the Scottish Government were to back them in doing so, from borrowing to invest in publicly owned and community-owned renewables that could be generating income, not just clean energy.</p><p>The document contains rhetoric about low-carbon transport, but let us follow the money. The most substantial investments are in road building. In Glasgow, what is spent on the M74 dwarfs all the investment not only in the local roads that people use daily&#8212;money to deal with potholes, for example&#8212;but in sustainable transport. I commend Kevin Stewart, who may have been a single breath from saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about building more roads and expanding the airports&#8212;it&#8217;s also about sustainability.&#8221; With that remarkable level of doublethink, he will go far in the dysfunctional industry that we have.</p><p>Any talk about connected cities seems to relate only to the drive time to get to cities, and to contain nothing about travel within cities. Furthermore, in looking at the transport elements of a document about cities, I was astonished to see nothing at all about buses. How can we address the transport needs of a city such as Glasgow&#8212;in which most households do not have access to a car&#8212;if we are not prepared to acknowledge that people are receiving a grossly inadequate bus service? The service will not improve unless we take action.</p><p>I am not criticising only the current Government or its current strategy; I would level the same criticisms at the Glasgow City Council document &#8220;Future Glasgow&#8221;. It is a glossy document containing bland aspirational phrases with which few people could disagree. By the looks of the photographs, by 2061 everyone in Glasgow will be involved in a Ready brek advert, not in real life in a city.

If we call for consensus, we all really need to start acting like we mean it, and that goes for everybody.</p><p>The Labour motion contains one call that I warmly welcome: for a participative, all-party and civic process. The Greens have been calling for that for years now; we feel that neither the Calman process nor the national conversation achieved the inclusive ethos that the Scottish Constitutional Convention tried to embody. We could have done even better than the convention did at the time by closing off none of the options in taking forward a participative approach. Sadly, that did not happen, but an all-party, inclusive, civic process could still be helpful in resolving those matters for which no mandate yet exists.</p><p>However, the motion suggests beginning the process with a conclusion, by specifying a single question, despite the evidence that we have heard that in civic Scotland there are a range of views on that matter.</p><p>We must be realistic about the aspects that were settled by the election result last year. The fact of the referendum is one such aspect: that has been settled, and all parties now appear to accept that. The form of it has not yet been settled, and that remains an open question. If we wish to engage with civic Scotland on that matter, we should do so openly.</p><p>We should also accept that the timing, which is limited to the extent that it has been said that the referendum will be held in the second half of the session, is settled. I invite members who have complained about that to speculate on the leaders&#8217; debate in the run-up to the election, in which Mr Salmond was asked when a referendum would be held and said that it would be in the second half of the session. If he had said that it would be held immediately, do we not imagine that the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative leaders would all have thrown up their hands in full horror and said, &#8220;No, not in the middle of a recession&#8212;you have to focus on jobs, jobs, jobs&#8221;? He was right to say that we should hang off a bit and focus on the country&#8217;s immediate economic needs, whatever they might be&#8212;we have different views on that&#8212;and to specify the second half of the session. We should accept that.</p><p>The Government has given its preferred timescale as being autumn 2014, and it will consult. The UK Government is consulting too. The opportunity surely exists for both sides to give a wee bit of ground, and for each to try to reach consensus on the aspects of the process on which that can be achieved; it is not too late.</p><p>The Scottish Government should accept that there is a legitimate role for the Electoral Commission. If we were to set up a separate body, we would probably end up recruiting people from the Electoral Commission to staff it, because that is where the expertise on these matters lies. The Scottish Government could give ground on that.</p><p>Similarly, the UK Government could&#8212;and should&#8212;give ground on other issues such as votes for 16 and 17-year-olds. Those steps&#8212;with each side giving a wee bit of ground&#8212;would set a whole new tone, and that is the spirit in which we must go forward if we are to resolve the other matters that have not yet been settled.</p><p>On the legal basis, we have a clear choice between the Scottish Government&#8217;s assertion of an existing legal basis and a section 30 order, which could be brought forward only if there are sufficiently few strings attached to it that it is acceptable to the Scottish Parliament. That consensus will be achieved only if both sides are willing to give a wee bit of ground first.</p><p>On the form of the referendum, should there be one question or two? We should remain open minded on that. That is an example of the kind of issue on which a participative, public and civic process could help to achieve a conclusion with far more authority than we, as political parties, can achieve between us.</p><p>If we can get both Governments to accept that compromise means giving way a bit on each side, we will be able to move on to the more substantive issues&#8212;the competing visions that exist of the country&#8217;s future. Whether we have devolution, devo plus, devo max or independence, it is what the powers are used for that matters most, and that is what we should be engaging the public on.</p><p>This is about a vision of a country that focuses on sustainability and living within our means versus the destructive pursuit of everlasting growth; a vision of economic justice closing the gap between rich and poor versus the idea of Scotland as the tax haven of the north; and a vision of equality and modern, progressive values versus narrow-minded and conservative values. There are also questions about the currency&#8212;about how to manage jointly a fiscal union without full political union or whether another option should be chosen&#8212;and about the new relationship that we would have with the rest of the UK. For example, could we prohibit any future Scottish Government from agreeing a way of facilitating the continued existence of Trident or other weapons of mass destruction in Scotland? That kind of debate would be inspiring not only for young Scots&#8212;the 16 and 17-year-olds who might be voting&#8212;but for the many people who became involved in the independence movement because of issues such as Trident.

In particular, I thank it for some of the early context-setting paragraphs in its report that discuss the national performance framework and its potential relationship to the agenda set out in the Carnegie UK Trust&#8217;s report &#8220;More Than GDP: Measuring What Matters&#8221;, which the committee discussed with the trust.

Although the process is complex, however, it is probably fair to say that this year it will be a wee bit less unpredictable than it has been for the past four years.

Willie Rennie argued that we cannot just wish money into being. In my view, the UK Government&#8217;s position would have the slightest shred of credibility only if it was not simultaneously going to Europe and making every effort to argue against a financial transaction tax and against action to shut down the tax havens. Such measures would increase the revenue available to all Governments throughout the United Kingdom&#8212;for as long as it exists.</p><p>The social wage is another element of the Government&#8217;s response to the times that we live in: the idea that providing a range of policies across the board&#8212;many of which are intended to reduce the squeeze on household budgets&#8212;will recompense people for the real-terms cuts in public sector pay.</p><p>The concept of the social wage must develop over time if it is going to be seen as reasonable. I refer members to the evidence given by Stephen Boyd of the Scottish Trades Union Congress to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee that the measures that are regarded as part of the social wage are</p><p>&#8220;unlikely to &#8216;fill the gap&#8217; for a public sector worker earning &#163;25,000&#8221;</p><p>who is facing a continued pay freeze. However, if we follow through on the ethos of the social wage, we will be able to come up with a different stance on the economy from that of the UK Government. The Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee welcomed that concept but said that it looks</p><p>&#8220;forward to more detail on the concept and greater clarity on how the measure will support solidarity and cohesion, and reduce inequality&#8221;.</p><p>I hope that the Government will respond to that call.</p><p>I turn to some criticisms. The vast majority of the cuts are being handed to Scottish public services by the UK. Housing and further education are among the clearest targets, but the decision to target them flies in the face of the Government&#8217;s performance framework. How will those cuts impact on the targets that relate to improving the incomes of the poorest people in our society? That is one of the areas in which we are making least progress towards the national performance framework objectives, and we need to be concerned about that.</p><p>The budget protects road building, as it always does, year after year. Pouring the concrete is far more important to Government after Government&#8212;not just the current one&#8212;than are other objectives. There is still no shift towards low-carbon transport spending, which has been called for for years.

Although I thought that the flaws in the bill were probably too deep to be rectified by amendments, I lodged a number of amendments at stage 2 because I took the view that, if the Government was determined to push the bill all the way, the least that we could do was try to shave off a few of the rough edges and resolve a few of the more significant problems. Unfortunately, I was not successful at persuading the Government that some of my worthy stage 2 amendments should be agreed to, so I have come back with a few smaller ones at stage 3. I again make it clear that I believe that the flaws in the bill run very deep and that, even if the Government accepts all my amendments, I am not sure that that will make me vote to pass the bill.</p><p>The bill has been portrayed as being a football bill or a sectarianism bill but, in reality, it is nothing of the kind. Although part of it applies only to football and part of it applies only to religion, it is a much wider hate crime bill, which will sit alongside the other pieces of hate crime legislation that have been passed.</p><p>Members will be aware that, in the last session of Parliament, I worked with the Government on such legislation in the form of the Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill, which, in the end, received the support of all the Opposition parties. We considered whether to include in that bill the offence of incitement to hatred. Along with some of the organisations that lobbied for the bill, I and other politicians considered whether incitement to hatred was an issue that we wanted to get into.</p><p>The UK Government and the Westminster Parliament have implemented incitement to hatred legislation, but the Scottish Parliament has never done so. Until about a week before the introduction of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill, I thought that there was still a pretty clear consensus that we did not feel that it was right to pursue incitement to hatred in legislation without a great deal more careful consideration, but that is what the bill does.</p><p>The bill creates the offence of incitement to hatred, albeit only in highly specific circumstances. It was unclear why, if the Government supported the introduction of incitement to hatred legislation, it had defined those circumstances in the way in which it had. Therefore, at stage 2, I lodged amendments that would have extended the grounds of incitement to hatred to cover all the other grounds that are mentioned in relation to other aspects of the bill. I put those amendments forward for debate, but I did not press them to a vote, because I had concerns that we were creating rushed legislation and that we were stepping over a line that we had previously agreed, on a cross-party basis, not to step over.</p><p>Following those stage 2 considerations, it was clearer to me than ever that we would be making a serious mistake. Therefore, the amendments in group 4&#8212;amendments 8 and 9&#8212;say to ministers that, if they intend to use the power that they wish to have to extend the scope of the incitement to hatred offence or the other offence, in addition to asking the Parliament&#8217;s permission, they will need to begin a public debate on the proposal. The consequences of getting wrong hate speech legislation are far graver than the consequences of getting wrong legislation on other hate crimes. With statutory aggravation, we are talking only about treating existing offences differently because of motivation but, with hate speech legislation, we would be in much more danger of stepping over the line on free speech. The free speech defence that the Government has included does not apply to the whole bill or to both the offences that are proposed.</p><p>With amendments 8 and 9, I argue that the Government should have to consult publicly and begin a public debate with a view to ensuring that if, in future, it decides that it wishes to come back with an order to extend the scope of the offences, we do not make more mistakes than we have to.</p><p>I move amendment 8.</p>", "hdate": "2011-12-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22657196", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I have made it fairly clear all along that I am no great fan of the bill.

I was not around because I was at a conference on hate crime, funnily enough, at which I learned a lot about the wide range of approaches that are being taken in European Union member states and various parts of the United States. Those approaches work in different contexts, of course. In the US, for example, there is strong constitutional protection of free speech. In many European countries, on the other hand, there is a record of laws on hate speech or controlling speech&#8212;for example, laws on Holocaust denial.</p><p>Different countries take different approaches in the light of their different historical and cultural contexts and the different kinds of hate crime that they consider important. However, legislating on incitement to hatred is not a universal approach. It is not always the wrong approach&#8212;there is a case for it, as well as a case against it&#8212;but part of my problem with the bill is that Parliament has always tilted towards the argument against legislating on incitement to hatred, although it has never run away from the argument for it.</p><p>If we wish to change that, we should try to do it on a cross-party basis and we must ensure that we do it in a careful and considered away that takes account of all the possible consequences before we start the journey. However, the bill came out of the blue. It will result in legislation on incitement to hatred in specifically defined contexts. In Christine Grahame&#8217;s speech, there was a suggestion that it will not apply in other circumstances&#8212;in ordinary communities&#8212;and, at one point, I heard a heckle from the SNP benches: &#8220;Well, maybe it should.&#8221; Yes. Maybe it should, but maybe it should not. Let us not take the first step on a road that will lead us we know not where, without having properly considered all the consequences.</p><p>There is a case for legislation on incitement to hatred. The UK Government and Westminster Parliament have introduced it not only on religious grounds but, for example, on the ground of sexual orientation, but this Parliament has not done that. In fact, the bill goes way beyond the legislation on incitement to hatred in other places: it criminalises the expression of hatred, not only the inciting of hatred in others, so it goes way beyond what even some of the most gung-ho jurisdictions in the EU are doing on incitement to hatred. At various points at stages 2 and 3, I have tried to lodge amendments that might have toned down those measures or changed the context of them.</p><p>I have tried to examine why we talk about &#8220;hatred&#8221; in the bill when we talk about &#8220;malice&#8221; and &#8220;ill will&#8221; in other legislation. I also tried to think about how we define the circumstances&#8212;for example, whether the measures on a place where a regulated football match is being shown would apply if somebody was simply playing a clip of a match on their mobile phone. I tried to examine the fear and alarm test by asking whether a serious charge with a serious penalty requires a serious and credible threat or just the suggestion of one. I also attempted to widen the free-speech defence.</p><p>I am afraid that the successful amendment&#8212;an obligation to consult and report on the operation of the offences&#8212;is no substitute for those other changes, so the bill will still be bad legislation. No doubt it will be passed, but the Parliament should still assert itself after it has been passed.</p><p>I regret that we are not debating my amendment that would have called for consolidation of hate crime law on a set timescale. Consolidation will be required, so I call on the minister to make a commitment on that and for Parliament to join me in calling for that consolidation work to happen.</p><p>There may be a worthy intention behind the bill, but it is the wrong approach.

Now only those who live in denial, who indulge in conspiracy theories and who are hard-right economic libertarians are dismissed as such&#8212;[Interruption.] I am sure that Alex Johnstone more than any of us welcomes the progress that has been made.</p><p>I welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s participation in the international discussions that will take place not just this year but, I hope, in future. However, these United Nations debates always bring a mixture of emotions. People do their best to sustain hope while preparing for the inevitable disappointment, and the strong acceptance that something must be done is often lost in negotiation and a failure to recognise that nature itself does not negotiate.</p><p>Clearly there is a need for a global binding agreement, not just a short-term fix&#8212;or what we might call a second Kyoto commitment period, which I would nevertheless welcome in the interim. We need a commitment to a timescale towards 2015, a legally binding treaty containing the implication that 2015 will be the global peak year for emissions and a commitment to global 80 per cent cuts by 2050. We also need movement on financing to ensure that low-carbon development can be available to poorer countries. Instead of making economic growth for the world&#8217;s rich countries our priority, we should be prioritising the eradication of poverty in the world&#8217;s poorer parts and making that compatible with the climate change programme.</p><p>There are sources of financing that we can put in place for that, but, sadly, the UK Government&#8212;the &#8220;greenest&#8221; Government in history&#8212;is doing its very best to prevent a financial transactions tax and taxes on high-carbon-emitting industries such as the aviation industry. The UK Government seems to be utterly disinterested in those opportunities. We need those taxes to finance a lot of that work and many of the other priorities that we hope will come out of the global negotiations.</p><p>Will any of this happen? Sadly, progress is likely to remain painfully slow. We are likely to see the continuation of a country-by-country approach in the period leading up to some future deal&#8212;and I hope that there will be a deal. In his opening speech, the minister spoke of the progress that he sees where countries see economic benefits to be gained. The great danger is that the conference will simply become an opportunity for countries to fall back on GDP and not CO2 as their priority, while countries that do not see an economic benefit will make no changes. Scotland&#8217;s credibility on the issue, like that of any other country, will come from actions, not targets. As Marco Biagi said, deeds are what count.</p><p>The minister said that Scotland</p><p>&#8220;is already securing competitive advantage&#8221;,</p><p>but that is not the same as cutting emissions. I cannot be the only person who remembers the clear commitment to a 3 per cent annual cut in Scotland&#8217;s CO2, and not just from when the climate change legislation was introduced. That was to be the commitment from the moment the SNP came to power but, sadly, it has not happened. I am afraid that saying that we are two thirds of the way towards a target is complacent. We have done the easy bit of the journey; the hard bit has not even begun. In fact, most of the emissions cuts that we have seen over the years have been the result of deindustrialisation and, in more recent years, recession.</p><p>Despite the commitment on paper for the Government not to use credits to meet our CO2 targets, an order has been introduced to allow that approach. If we do not want to use credits&#8212;the Government does not need to use them&#8212;let us reject that order.</p><p>Our consensus on the climate change legislation was powerful and rare. Not many countries in which there is a political debate about climate change manage to get that degree of consensus. Five political parties sought to make the bill better and stronger as it was considered, and they all lodged amendments and succeeded in getting them incorporated into the bill to strengthen it before it was passed. That is rare, but the consensus was limited to the aspiration, intention and targets. We have never achieved that consensus on actions.</p><p>I refer to Malcolm Chisholm&#8217;s comments on the transport budget and transport policy. Transport is an ideal example of where actual actions that have been taken for many years&#8212;not just under the current Administration but under its predecessor&#8212;have been out of kilter with climate change targets. If anybody&#8212;minister or not&#8212;wants to try to persuade me that the M74 extension is good in climate change terms, they will need to buy me a lot of drinks in the bar to make the effort.</p><p>Aside from supporting a good renewables programme, the Government has not recognised that increased renewable electricity generation does nothing in climate change terms unless it is used to phase out fossil fuels. We have heard from Fergus Ewing a gleeful prediction about another 50 years of oil and gas extraction and a refusal to rule out shale gas extraction in Scotland. If we extract and burn that shale gas, we will add billions of tonnes of unnecessary fossil carbon to the atmosphere. It does not matter a whit whether that ends up in Scotland&#8217;s emissions inventory or somebody else&#8217;s. If we want to take responsibility, we need to phase out those dirty industries, not pursue any opportunity for GDP growth that we can see from the agenda. We should take a bit of responsibility.</p><p>I thank the Presiding Officer for her indulgence and the few extra seconds.</p>", "hdate": "2011-11-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22655820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Nations Climate Summit"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is clear that the political significance attached to climate change has come a very long way since previous decades when the Greens, who had been campaigning on such issues for many years, were dismissed as eccentrics.

That was not so much because of what is written in the motion&#8212;I do not disagree with much that is in it. My decision related to some of my discomfort with past alcohol debates in the chamber. Some debates about alcohol and alcohol policy have involved some hypocrisy. That relates partly to the economic impact&#8212;everyone wants to preserve the whisky industry and other industries for export, without necessarily taking account of the health impacts&#8212;and partly to our personal behaviour.</p><p>At stage 3 of the bill on alcohol in 2005, on the last day of the bill&#8217;s passage through the Parliament after years of consultation, back benchers from several parties lodged last-minute amendments and made what were, frankly, sanctimonious speeches about saving their communities from the demon drink. At about half past 6, after a delayed decision time, we all trooped down to the garden lobby, where huge trays of free booze awaited us at the evening reception. How we debate alcohol involves a degree of doublethink and hypocrisy.</p><p>I will set myself a wee personal rule about motions. I would like to support motions about alcohol that do not ignore the harm or the positive&#8212;what is or could be good about a healthier drinking culture. Our aspiration should be not to curb our drinking culture but to change it&#8212;to try to achieve a better, healthier and more positive drinking culture that is safer, calmer and worth celebrating.</p><p>What would such a culture look like? Over the past few decades and throughout my lifetime, the industry has changed slowly and gradually, largely because it is too often regulated as though it was just any other industry. Gradually, control of the industry has been handed over to smaller numbers of much more powerful organisations&#8212;multinationals and large multiples and chains. That applies to production, serving and selling&#8212;to on-sales and off-sales. It was irresponsible of our society to hand over control of this recreational drug to multinationals. Meanwhile, we must recognise that some companies out there&#8212;including many in Scotland&#8212;are proud to make their profits from quality and not from volume.</p><p>Something that was worth having and which we have destroyed are the links and the responsibility that local community pubs have to the people they serve. Locally owned, independent pubs have lower staff turnover and more connection with the people they serve. Some of the manufacturers that make their profits from quality instead of volume sales are struggling compared with the Diageos, the Wetherspoons and the vertical drinking establishments in our cities. Companies that should be worth celebrating are struggling&#8212;they have been marginalised.</p><p>I say yes to minimum pricing and to a range of other measures that I hope we will get consensus on. I also say that, fundamentally, we need a better drinking culture that we are willing to talk about in positive terms.

It has been a long time coming: roughly 150 years since Tyndall identified the basic mechanism of the greenhouse effect and the better part of 50 years since the evidence began to accumulate that the effect was taking place as a result of emissions related to human activity.</p><p>It should be therefore be quite a happy moment for a Green party politician to be able to stand here and talk about a Government that places the phrase &#8220;low-carbon economy&#8221; front and centre in its economic strategy. Sadly, I come out of the debate with mixed feelings. Fergus Ewing gave the game away just two minutes into his speech, when he said that all the economic opportunities from renewable energy and low-carbon industries must be seen as additional to continued dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p>The terms &#8220;low-carbon economy&#8221; and &#8220;low-carbon sector&#8221; were used in Mr Ewing&#8217;s speech as though they are interchangeable. They are not. One is an assertion about the entire economy. A low-carbon economy means much more than just generating more renewable electricity: it means burning less fossil fuel. A low-carbon sector means that there are some economic opportunities in this sector and some in that sector, and it does not really matter if one is high carbon and the other is low carbon. There is a contradiction in that approach. If the low-carbon economy is seen simply as an addition to the high-carbon economy, we are no further forward.</p><p>I have congratulated the SNP on its action whenever possible, and I have never shied from criticising it when I feel that I have to. The SNP record on renewables is good&#8212;it can always be better, but it is good.</p><p>However, on fossil fuels, under the SNP we have seen a significant expansion of opencast coal extraction; a proposal for a new coal-fired power station on which we still await a decision; political support for new exploratory oil drilling; and a refusal, so far, to rule out hydraulic fracturing to capture shale gas, which is another means of securing new, unconventional fossil fuel reserves.</p><p>The amendment that I lodged has not been selected but, hey, how many Opposition amendments are going to get through in the next four and a half years? I am going to talk about it anyway. As my amendment suggests, the world already has more than enough&#8212;probably twice as much than is needed&#8212;known and identified reserves of fossil fuels to make irreversible climate change unavoidable. The challenge ahead of us is not to burn the stuff that we have found. It will always be economically beneficial in the short term to burn fossil fuels, but we need to wean ourselves off doing that. We need to leave the coal in the hole; we must leave the fossil fuels where they are. If we extract that fossil carbon and put it into the global economy, whether it shows up in Scotland&#8217;s emissions targets or anybody else&#8217;s, irreversible climate change will be unavoidable.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651783", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Low-carbon Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There is much that I endorse in Joe FitzPatrick&#8217;s speech.

If only it was that easy&#8212;if only a magic hat, from which Mr Swinney could pull a rabbit, existed. That is not the case. However, he can make serious choices, which are for us all to make.</p><p>I support the important choice that has been made to keep access to higher education free and to commit to a minimum student income. However, we should not feel satisfied about a figure of &#163;7,000 a year, which is barely half the income of somebody who earns the living wage, which many of us aspire to allowing all people to expect. Let us be clear that living on &#163;7,000 a year is living in poverty&#8212;we should not be satisfied about that.</p><p>There are choices to make about revenue raising. Mr Swinney said that options for revenue raising had been examined but&#8212;to be honest&#8212;little detail was given about the substantive choices that could be made. I welcome the measures on empty properties, for which I have called, and I look forward to seeing the detail. Those measures must be extended to cover vacant and derelict urban land, because speculation in some such areas has been the most damaging to the fabric of our urban communities.</p><p>Tax increment finance was mentioned. Perhaps it has a role in some circumstances, but again I express concern about the proposal in Glasgow that would in effect involve publicly underwriting the private risk of expanding a shopping centre. That would be an inappropriate use of tax increment finance.</p><p>A choice has been made to shift &#163;750 million from revenue to capital. That choice is on a whopping scale. I agree that investment is an important aspect not just of meeting our on-going needs but of recovery, but what investment is important to choose? We should not choose to shift &#163;750 million from revenue to capital to fund an ever-growing roads budget while public sector pay remains frozen.</p><p>Mr Swinney talked about the future transport fund. I welcome much under that heading, but it is utterly contradicted by today&#8217;s transport spending.</p><p>Another choice that has been made is to push for local government borrowing powers for investment. That opportunity could be phenomenally powerful, but in what do we ask local government to invest borrowed resources? A massive investment programme in publicly owned renewables would generate revenue for the future, as well as clean energy. It could leave us with a legacy whereby every local authority had its own local energy company that contributed to the economy, as well as the environment. If we simply ask local government to invest in initiatives to which the Scottish Government previously contributed, we will be no better off.</p><p>Similarly, investment in quality, energy-efficient housing is a real priority. Mr Swinney spoke about working with energy companies to increase their investment in energy efficiency. That is all well and good, and such work will get wide support, but for years there has been a pretty much unanimous call that that task will need public investment on a dramatically higher scale than we have ever seen before. It is not a matter of working with the energy companies or public investment: we need both.</p><p>Finally, the position on public sector pay and pensions represents a real and meaningful choice that will impact severely on individuals throughout Scotland. Public sector workers will be rightly angry at seeing their pay and conditions undermined for the purpose of raiding revenue to pay for a road building programme. I sincerely hope that Mr Swinney has had proper discussions with public sector unions about those issues, as they may be left with no choice but to take action to defend public sector workers and the services that they deliver in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2011-09-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22651370", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Strategic Spending Review"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is clear that the Liberal Democrats support that agenda one day and do not support it the next.

I am also happy to welcome the positive, if still somewhat vague, sentiments on the social wage. I hope that that gains more definition over time, rather than simply being a buzz word.</p><p>In essence, it is clear that the term, &#8220;sustainable economic growth&#8221;, is still little different to plain, old-fashioned vanilla economic growth. There are commitments on the page in relation to cohesion, sustainability and social solidarity, but the evidence from Government priorities and actions does not suggest that the former are, in a significant way, on a par with conventional economic growth. That is a shame, because the overwhelming evidence from around the world is that in rich, developed societies, closing the gap between rich and poor benefits wellbeing far more than simply growing GDP, especially if the benefit of growing GDP is captured by those who are already wealthy. Tavish Scott pointed out that there are no specific targets on growth. That is true; nor are there any specific targets or criteria that might be used to define what sustainability means in the economy.</p><p>Low-carbon economy is fast becoming another buzz word, but it needs to be so much more. Our economy does not become low carbon by generating more renewable energy; it becomes low carbon by burning less fossil fuel. The SNP record seems to show a preference for more of everything&#8212;yes, more renewables, but also digging and burning more coal and pumping more oil.</p><p>Capital investment is another area that shows that not all growth is sustainable growth. For the price of the M74 extension, Glasgow could have seen crossrail, the Glasgow airport rail link, a refurbished subway, more cycle lanes than pretty much any other city in the UK, a new fleet of low-carbon buses run on a properly regulated network and an Oyster card system to make it all much easier to use&#8212;and it would still have had change to repair pretty much every pothole and broken pavement in the city. That would have not only provided economic benefits, but ensured that those benefits go to those who currently have less&#8212;the 60 per cent or so in Glasgow who do not have access to a car.</p><p>The Green amendment, which was not selected for debate, develops the critique of growth, which is a view shared in a briefing that has been sent round to MSPs by not only WWF Scotland and Friends of the Earth Scotland&#8212;the organisations that you might expect&#8212;but international development organisations such as Oxfam and the STUC. It is also supported by the First Minister&#8217;s aforementioned favourite economist, Joseph Stiglitz.

The First Minister was quite right to say that investment in the future should be the priority.</p><p>However, I urge the First Minister and the Government to follow through on the logic of that argument, and to stop pursuing the reckless idea of cuts to corporation tax if the powers are won. That type of policy would only leave yet another hole in the public finances and make the cuts to public services even worse. Instead of tax giveaways to big businesses, there are many priorities on which we should be able to unite in order to&#8212;in the First Minister&#8217;s words&#8212;&#8220;make Scotland better&#8221;.</p><p>I turn to a few areas of the legislative programme in which there is common ground, where we can work together and where constructive opposition will involve bringing ideas to improve the Government&#8217;s plans rather than opposing them. On the proposed water bill, for example, we have heard a wee bit less in the way of ambition from the First Minister today. He used to talk about turning Scottish Water into one of Scotland&#8217;s biggest renewable energy generators: a massive publicly owned renewables company. We should put some of that ambition back into the bill.</p><p>I certainly welcome the return of the minimum pricing proposal, but I agree with Iain Gray about the wide-ranging debate that is needed&#8212;not just purely on minimum pricing, but on other measures too. Both sides&#8212;Labour and the SNP&#8212;lost out in the last debate on alcohol legislation by blocking each other&#8217;s ideas. We should ensure that we take a more mature approach and get the best legislation that we can.</p><p>I also welcome the move to increase council tax on empty homes. It is a positive measure and will help not only to bring in revenue, but to create disincentives to keeping homes empty. However, we should go further and say that we should do the same with business rates. A huge number of empty and derelict properties pay no business rates at all, and yet are held back from development, often by speculative investors who are making a profit on that investment and artificially increasing prices for real, active local businesses.</p><p>I welcome the proposed bill on land registration, which could&#8212;if it is done right&#8212;provide the groundwork for a land value tax. The Greens have argued for such a tax for many years and the SNP has flirted with it year after year, but never quite committed to it. It could be used to fund the investment in our future about which the First Minister talked.</p><p>I also welcome the proposed freedom of information legislation, but I hope that the Government will extend the scope of FOI to include contractors for the public sector and arm&#8217;s-length companies.</p><p>The opportunities for all programme also sounds welcome. I want to see more of the detail and I remind the Government of its support in January for our proposal for a microfinance scheme for young people. That would be far better than bungs to big businesses and would support young people to get their own small ideas off the ground. I urge the inclusion of that measure in the programme.</p><p>I welcome, of course, the commitment to continue and build on the climate challenge fund, which we persuaded John Swinney to include in a budget a few years ago. However, it needs more than just a junior version added to it: it needs a way to move forward developed projects and turn them into self-financing social enterprises or renewable energy generators so that they do not lose the experience that they have built up simply because they are grant dependent.</p><p>The proposed rights of children and young people bill will be welcome. How we deal with the rights of children and young people who are dependent on devolved and reserved services and Governments remains a problem. We will look to see whether we can improve that bill as well.</p><p>There are a few matters on which we will have to oppose the Government&#8217;s programme. I share the opposition to the idea of a single police force. Hugh Henry&#8217;s suggestion that a single chief constable could come politically to rival a minister and an elected Government is a serious cause for concern.</p><p>We do not support aspects of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill, not only the timescale of emergency legislation. Aspects of the proposals will have to be removed if the Greens are to support the bill.</p><p>There are also matters on which the Government&#8217;s programme is silent and, therefore, on which constructive opposition will mean applying pressure for new action. One example is the wider equalities and human rights legislation. I welcome the consultation on equal marriage&#8212;its tone, not just its existence&#8212;but was disappointed not to see a commitment to a timescale in the legislative programme. There is no reason why we should have to wait until 2013 when we know that the consultation will be over well before Christmas.</p><p>On climate change, we need to move forward on transforming our transport system so that it becomes sustainable.</p><p>There was nothing about the referendum. Iain Gray again had fun winding up the Government about the lack of detail on it, but as a supporter&#8212;someone who wants a referendum question on which I can campaign for a yes vote&#8212;I say that now is the time for a participative and democratic process to put the detail into the proposals for the independent country that the SNP wants to create. That would include all the questions such as whether to appoint, elect or simply inherit the head of state, and the timing of the vote.

I point out the tragic irony for Alex Neil in taking on this role at this time. He has been required to continue the nonsense of having a 1960s mentality to road building at a time when more enlightened cities around the world are tearing down such infrastructure, because they recognise that that is the better way to serve the economic, social and environmental needs of the urban environment.</p><p>I can well understand how fans of Dr Beeching in the 1960s could, while public transport infrastructure that we would value today was being ripped from the ground, delude themselves with the vision of mile after mile of gleaming tarmac, which would never fill up, never clog up and never cause any social, environmental or economic problems associated with congestion, as they simply thought that it was the way to go, but how tragic it is that we are continuing that thinking when we are supposed to be building infrastructure for the 21st century.</p><p>Let me point out a couple of more enlightened cities around the world. A few years ago, Seoul removed one of its major freeways, which had carried 168,000 vehicles a day into the city. One of the key planners in the project that removed that piece of infrastructure said:</p><p>&#8220;As soon as we destroyed the road, the cars just disappeared and drivers changed their habits&#8221;&#8212;</p><p>I see that Jackson Carlaw is laughing&#8212;and</p><p>&#8220;A lot of people just gave up their cars.&#8221;</p><p>They found from 2002 onwards that a lot of people gave up their cars and others found a different route for driving. In some cases they kept their cars but changed their routes. The highway&#8217;s removal made room for the restoration of an urban park and a stream, which is now a focal point and a matter of pride for the city.</p><p>In New Orleans in the 1950s, decades before hurricane Katrina, the construction of interstate 10 precipitated Trem&#233;&#8217;s decline from one of the wealthiest African-American communities in the city to an area of high poverty and vacancy. The number of businesses in the area fell 75 per cent between 1960 and 2000. New Orleans is another enlightened city that is removing such infrastructure and finding economic, social and environmental benefits from doing so.</p><p>Let us imagine the public transport system that Glasgow could have had for the &#163;650 million that has been spent on the M74. It could have had crossrail, the Glasgow airport rail link, a new subway or a new fleet of buses, with a properly regulated service and an Oyster card system to make it all easier to use.

Most stage 1 speeches begin with a fairly obvious and slightly boring comment in which the member thanks the relevant committee for producing its detailed stage 1 report and taking all the evidence on the bill. We make that comment time after time&#8212;and we mean it. Today, we do not have before us a stage 1 report that would give us the opportunity to reflect on how members have received evidence, reflected on it and changed their view.

This is not a sectarianism bill&#8212;it covers a wide range of forms of hate crime. That is good in principle, for example because of the high level of homophobia that exists both in football and elsewhere in society. However, it clearly implies a far wider range of situations in which offences could be committed under the bill. Previously, time has been taken to consider the options&#8212;to recognise that not every form of hate crime requires exactly the same legislative response, because the details differ. The working group on hate crime that was set up back in the first session produced recommendations that were not enacted until my member&#8217;s bill&#8212;the Offences (Aggravation By Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill&#8212;did so last session.

I was very happy to work with him in gaining his support for my bill on hate crimes, which became law with the unanimous agreement of the Parliament. I was therefore particularly happy to welcome his comments in his opening speech about the emphasis on building an inclusive and tolerant society that is at ease with its diversity. In order to do that, it is important that when we see prejudice and bigotry we do not ignore it, mutter under our breath out of politeness or find a way to excuse it. We should name it for what it is and challenge it publicly in every setting, whether that is a football match,the pub, the street, online or, indeed, Parliament.</p><p>As the cabinet secretary asks us to look at one aspect of bigotry and prejudice in our society&#8212;sectarianism&#8212;we need to be careful about legislating. In justice in particular, the unintended consequences when legislation is badly or hurriedly drafted can be clear. We have seen, for example, the case of Paul Chambers south of the border. For sending a bad joke about Robin Hood airport&#8212;not a funny or sensible joke to make, but a joke&#8212;he was convicted of sending a menacing electronic communication. I am sure that members are aware of the case. He lost on appeal as well and was landed with a bill for thousands of pounds in costs after a year of having his case dragged through the courts.</p><p>The threat was not a credible one or one that any reasonable person would have thought was intended to be carried out, but it appears that the legislation that we will be asked to look at&#8212;in the space of about a week&#8212;will introduce a similar system, removing the requirement for the prosecution to demonstrate an intention to carry out a threat. There are serious issues to address in relation to sectarianism, but if we are serious about the legislation we should take the time to get it right. I have not yet heard a clear argument about why the legislation is required specifically for this football season. If it was, it could have been introduced a year ago. My own bill was two sides of A4&#8212;a short, simple little bill&#8212;and it took years of consultation and scrutiny before it reached the statute book.</p><p>There are other ways in which badly drafted legislation is being misused in our society. On 15 May, as I was wandering through Glasgow city centre with a friend, we saw groups of what I can describe only as pack animals, some of them in green and some of them in blue, causing antisocial behaviour&#8212;if we want to call it that&#8212;and intimidating people. There was very aggressive behaviour on our streets, and our police struggled to address that with the limited resources that they have. On the same day, a young man in Edinburgh was being arrested for peacefully holding a banner that drew attention to the disgusting behaviour of tax avoiders in the UK who seek to hide their millions, or billions even, from the Exchequer&#8212;people who make the agenda of cuts, which we are all so concerned about, so much worse.</p><p>There are serious issues with that. We are living in a time when protest, direct action and industrial action play a vital part in our democratic process. It is a difficult balancing act for the police to protect people&#8217;s civic and individual rights against the state, but it is an important balance to strike.</p><p>Many of the people who have to use direct action and protest are doing so in pursuit of environmental justice. Rather than have police forces conduct covert surveillance on them or try to bribe them into undermining the ability of campaigners to organise, we should be taking environmental justice into the heart of our own justice system. In the final few moments that I have, I commend to the cabinet secretary a Friends of the Earth report on compliance with the Aarhus convention. The Aarhus convention requires us to make broad and affordable access to environmental justice the norm in Scotland. We are falling well short of that at present. The recommendations in the Friends of the Earth report for legal reform that would secure broad and affordable access to justice should be taken up by the cabinet secretary.

He talked about the quality of our society and said some things that should be of broad appeal to anyone on the centre left who subscribes to the idea of a good society as a counterpoint to the UK Government&#8217;s ideological cuts agenda. If he meant what he said&#8212;I hope that he does&#8212;we will not see the UK Government&#8217;s cuts simply being passed on to Scottish public services. The previous Scottish Government explored at least one way of raising additional revenue through large retailers. Let us at least keep that idea or something like it on the agenda; let us not just pass on the UK Government&#8217;s cuts if we mean what we say about a good society.</p><p>History shows that a truly equal, fair and kind society is built on good education and good health and that it values happiness higher than money. I believe in that profoundly. An important element of what the green parties around the world argue is that there are things that matter more than money and things in our economy that matter more than gross domestic product, which has become a narrow obsession. We even measure recession just in terms of GDP. I suspect that, if we took a broader view, we would find that equality, wellbeing and health have been in recession for very much longer than GDP has been in recession. Even at times when GDP has been growing for years, those aspects that we want to see in our society have been in recession. If the First Minister meant what he said in his statement, he will take a broader view than one that is based simply on GDP and he will replace that as the central measure of the economy.</p><p>I agree with the First Minister that there is a need for Scottish control of additional economic powers, but&#8212;I come back to where I began&#8212;for what purpose? We need to be clear about the purpose. Is it to create tax breaks for big business? Is that why we would like to have control of corporation tax? Not in my view. I also agree with the First Minister about the need to ensure that the poor are not made to pick up the bill for the rich and for the damage that the wealthiest in our society have done. If he meant what he said, we will see a restoration of the concept of the common good in Scotland. If he meant what he said about the profit of the land going to all, we will be implementing something that should have been implemented more than 100 years ago&#8212;a land value tax&#8212;instead of packaging up the planning system and selling it to Donald Trump.</p><p>Everybody takes the jobs agenda extremely seriously. The impact of the loss of jobs on our economy and on people&#8217;s lives is important and I welcome the commitment to try to achieve no compulsory redundancies in the public sector. However, even if we achieve that, we are still looking at substantial job losses. I do not think that anyone is able to put a figure on those losses yet&#8212;would it be 5 per cent of the Scottish public sector workforce? Seven per cent? Let us not kid ourselves that no compulsory redundancies is the end of that debate. We need to be clear about the value of the public sector and the value of public services. I should state that, yes, unlike others, I believe that public services are best delivered by the public sector.</p><p>The importance of education has been touched on. I entirely subscribe to the idea that we should aspire to keep access to higher education free in Scotland. However, that is not the end of the debate, either, because, as well as making it free to access, we have to fund it properly. If the First Minister means what he has said about this issue, there will be a reversal of the cuts to further and higher education as well as attempts to address the governance issues. The SNP has given signals that it is ready to address governance issues in our higher education institutions in particular, some of whose leaders have lost the trust of their entire academic communities as a result of some of the choices that they have made. I suggest, therefore, that the Government add to its list of constructive changes that it would like to be made to the Scotland Act 1998 a provision that would end the situation whereby the Privy Council scrutinises legislation on our universities.

Honestly, I think that most of us would acknowledge that the picture is mixed. Competition has done some things well and some badly. Jackson Carlaw pointed out some of the positives in the statistics that the CPT circulated, but he was trying so hard to be a counterpoint to Charlie Gordon&#8217;s old-Labour tribute act that he became a dated Thatcher tribute act. He was, however, slightly overgenerous to the companies when he said that 75 per cent of people believe that bus services operate when they are needed. That means that one in four people disagrees. It shows a significant failure if, when asked, one in four people says that bus services do not operate when they need them, and approximately the same proportion say that fares are not good value.</p><p>Did we ask the people who are not using bus services what they think and why they do not use them? It is not enough to say that three quarters of the people who use bus services are happy with them and one quarter are not. We should look at why the great bulk of people are not happy to use bus services.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw seemed to make the bizarre and astonishing claim that we have world-class bus services&#8212;actually, looking again at my notes, I see that that is not precisely the claim that he made; he said that we have a world-class bus industry. The crucial point is that it is possible to have successful, profitable businesses in the industry and a poor-quality service. I am more interested in having a successful and attractive bus service for Scotland.</p><p>The downsides of competition include the predatory services that Charlie Gordon described and inefficiency in service design. It is not enough just to have more efficient engines and vehicles. If we want to achieve carbon reductions, we need an efficient design of the services. Older, poor-quality vehicles still run on many of our roads.</p><p>On cuts to services, there will always be some service changes, whatever the regulatory environment, but at the moment the widespread and, I think, justified feeling is that passengers&#8217; views carry little or no weight when decisions on service changes that affect people&#8217;s lives and their quality of life are made.</p><p>Another downside is the lack of a transparent fare structure. I will give an example from Glasgow. My four-weekly bus pass costs me &#163;33. That is perfectly affordable for someone on a good salary or a reliable monthly income, but not everyone has the freedom to make such a choice. At that rate, it costs me about &#163;1.20 a day to use Glasgow buses, but someone who gets on a bus today and buys a daily ticket will pay nearly &#163;4. An individual ticket is the least affordable option, but that is the one that the worst-off in our society have to take. I compare that with the flat-rate system that operates in the Lothians.</p><p>The industry will, of course, be against significant reregulation but, frankly, many bus companies operate both in strongly regulated markets and in less regulated markets. They should worry only if they feel that they cannot compete against a public sector or not-for-profit model. Instead of listening to them, we should listen to bus passengers and to the people who do not use bus services because of the quality, the cost or the availability.</p><p>I will read out some comments that have been posted online in the past few days. One person said that, although they always got on and off at the same stop, it was a different price every time. Someone else said:</p><p>&#8220;Wait 30 mins for a bus. Squeeze on amongst 2x normal amount of people. Finally get seat.

The proposal that we are discussing is not the only example of that in Scotland. The issue is highly controversial and needs to be dealt with more widely.</p><p>I congratulate Jackson Carlaw on bringing the debate to the Parliament. I did not expect it to be opened by a reference to &#8220;Quatermass&#8221;, but a love of science fiction is obviously one of the vanishingly few characteristics that we genuinely share. If I understood him, the exact episode to which he referred might have been filmed at a nuclear site, which I will perhaps remind him of in a future debate.</p><p>Pretty much anything that we can do with our waste is controversial and comes with an ecological and social impact. That is one reason why we should begin every debate on waste with the point that we must produce less of it by reducing and reusing the materials that go through our economic system. However, there will always be, and certainly is at the moment, a substantial proportion that cannot be cut out of the system, and some waste management facilities will be necessary.</p><p>Recycling plants themselves are controversial, even though we want to recycle more. Landfill sites are hugely controversial, as well as having a wider, long-term ecological cost. Pretty much anything that we do with waste will be controversial. I think that there will always be some limited role for energy from waste, although it probably has more relevance for isolated communities, such as islands, where the cost of transporting waste to a recycling plant is an issue, than it has for other places. However, energy from waste must always be as efficient as possible, which means capturing the heat as well as the power. The proposed development is not a combined heat and power scheme. It will produce something like 150MW of heat that will mostly heat only the sky above the site, with absolutely no benefit to anyone.</p><p>Many of the relevant technologies have improved over the years and we should not be saying, &#8220;Never&#8212;no way.&#8221; However, aside from the inefficiency of the technology that is being proposed in the development that we are discussing tonight, the scale of the proposed site gives us concern. Apparently, the proposed floor space will be more than three times the floor space of the millennium dome. It will be capable of handling 1.5 million tonnes of raw waste a year. To put that into perspective, just over 55,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste were collected in East Renfrewshire in 2007-08. Waste has to be managed in some way, but I suggest that, above all other concerns about the development&#8212;such as the specific technology that is being used&#8212;it is the scale of the proposal that is most inappropriate, given the site that is proposed.</p><p>Building such massive plants with a locked-in dependency on that waste stream brings many risks as there is a need continually to feed the machine once it has been built. I draw members&#8217; attention to the experience that has been reported from Kent. It appears that, rather than making money from a plant that was approved 10 years ago, Kent County Council could be losing &#163;1 million a year as a result of the contract. The plant came on stream only recently because it took a long time to get through the planning process, but the council is now locked into a 25-year deal to provide the incinerator with 320,000 tonnes of waste to burn each year. The council now finds itself having to feed the machine&#8212;having to constantly find waste to burn, which means that it is burning waste that could be more valuably recycled. Speaking on behalf of the council, a councillor said that it had been a &#8220;stupid&#8221; decision in hindsight, as there had been no way to predict changes to the industry.</p><p>Those are the key concerns that are shared across the chamber.</p><p>I welcome Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s commitment to lie in front of the bulldozers. To end this speech on the science-fiction theme on which I began it, I should say that I welcome the idea of Jackson Carlaw lying down in front of a bulldozer in his dressing gown, Arthur Dent-style.

Even when I disagree with Mr Swinney&#8212;in fact, especially when I disagree with him&#8212;I try to give credit where it is due, so I will go as far as to say that he has always been pretty straightforward with other political parties during budget negotiations. But consensual? Not this time. The reality is that John Swinney does not need a consensus to get a budget through; he needs 65 votes. That is what he has sought to get, and it appears that he will get past that mark today. We do not, though, have consensus and we never have had it on the right response for Scotland to the Tory cuts down south.</p><p>I have made the Green position clear repeatedly and I will run through it one more time in case anyone is unclear about it. The cuts agenda that the UK Government is pursuing is not only economic vandalism but social vandalism, and it is unnecessary. There are also wrong priorities within the Scottish budget, with some cuts being more harmful than others. John Swinney has protected the road building programme with enough enthusiasm to make Jeremy Clarkson proud, but he has brought us a &#163;94 million cut to the housing budget. For him to come to the chamber today and talk about a &#163;16 million addition to that budget, as though it is some great stimulus measure that will blind us to the fact that there has been a &#163;94 million cut to that budget, is simply not credible.</p><p>Beyond that, revenue raising is necessary to protect public services and the investment in a low-carbon Scotland that we need. I believe that that revenue raising can be done within existing powers fairly and progressively if we are prepared to be creative, as we have sought to be. We have produced proposals on bringing empty properties into non-domestic rates and on bringing urban vacant land&#8212;land banks&#8212;into business rates, which could generate income. We have talked about an additional way of using a large business supplement that would have got over some of the arguments that we heard last year from the other Opposition parties against the retail levy. We have talked about progressive ways to raise revenue and about some of the unnecessary priorities that the Government is pursuing. Just delaying the pursuit of the replacement Forth road bridge by a year or so, until we hear the results of the engineering work on the existing bridge, would allow us to know whether that spending was necessary and we might be able to reverse a huge number of the cuts that are being made to the higher and further education budgets and to the housing budget, as well as plug the &#163;30 million gap and commit to a full-scale home insulation programme. However, the SNP has rejected those proposals, not out of necessity but out of political choice.</p><p>I am sure that Mr Swinney will be happy to see his budget passed, but is he happy with the new political alignment that he has fostered to achieve that? Around the turn of the year, I wrote to John Swinney urging him to take a stronger stance against the UK Government&#8217;s cuts agenda. I told him that if he was not willing to take that stance, he should look for support for his budget not to us, but to the parties behind that ideological cuts agenda. That seems to be exactly what he has done.</p><p>The Tory position is consistent&#8212;it is deeply harmful, but it is consistent. However, the Lib Dems&#8217; position on the budget is every bit as two-faced as their 2010 election campaign was. Desperate to rehabilitate themselves with the generation of students whom they have just betrayed, they come here and tell us about the importance that they place on bursaries&#8212;something that they know full well not a single party in the chamber would oppose, but they are using it as a pretext to vote for a budget that slashes the overall funding for higher and further education. Again, that is utterly not credible.</p><p>Last week, I read an interesting article in The Herald.

The nationalists will limit their use of the term &#8216;coalition&#8217;, believing that it fails to suggest sufficient responsibility for swingeing public spending cuts.&#8221;</p><p>The article ends:</p><p>&#8220;A senior SNP source said: &#8216;It is definitely language that you will see used more often.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>I think that we can start using it today because, if this budget is passed&#8212;a budget that implements Tory cuts that Scotland never voted for&#8212;it will not much matter whether the cabinet secretary who proposed that budget is a blue Tory, a yellow Tory or a tartan Tory; he will not deserve to be forgiven for offering Scotland a Tory-led budget.

I took the decision, or the Greens did as a group, not because we were beholden to anybody else&#8217;s agenda, but genuinely on the merits of the argument as it was put forward at the time. Perhaps that is what Robert Brown means when he throws around words such as erratic and unreliable. If so, I am pretty happy with that. I am sure that, by contrast, Mr Osborne regards the Liberal Democrats as extremely reliable and a pleasure to work with. I think that that is more to their shame than anyone else&#8217;s.</p><p>Robert Brown also said that the UK coalition inherited the worst fiscal deficit since the second world war. In making that comparison, let us contrast the current situation with the spirit and constructiveness of a generation that dealt with that deficit and still built the foundations of the welfare state rather than trying to tear them down.</p><p>I begin by asserting my view that Scotland does not support the UK Government&#8217;s agenda, which is using market failure of historic proportions as a pretext for a fundamental attack on public services and the welfare state. The Scottish Parliament must oppose that vandalism. Simply managing a Tory cuts agenda on behalf of George Osborne and Danny Alexander is unacceptable.</p><p>John Swinney said that when other political parties bring proposals on the budget to the debate, they must say where the resources are to come from within a fixed financial envelope. Even if I accepted that assumption, no member should be surprised to hear that the Greens cannot possibly support a budget that takes an axe to housing but leaves the road-building programme unscathed. If I did that, members would rightly ask what the Green party was even for. We have not forgotten what we are in politics for and we cannot support a budget that takes that approach.</p><p>We have similar concerns on a range of other issues. I would mention many of the issues that are raised in the briefings that have been circulated by organisations that have given evidence to the committees. At the same time as axing the freight facilities grant, the Government&#8217;s draft report on proposals and policies under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 makes a paper commitment to just such an incentive scheme to encourage modal shift to rail freight. No replacement is being suggested for the freight facilities grant, despite that paper commitment. There is no shift of transport spending to active travel, despite consistent all-party recommendations in budget reports year after year. There is a huge cut to energy efficiency spending, again despite consistent all-party committee recommendations year after year.</p><p>There is no clarity at all about the future of higher and further education. The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning states a principle that I can agree with&#8212;that higher education is best funded collectively by the taxpayer and that the burden should not be shifted to the individual&#8212;but that commitment is worth nothing if we are not willing to raise the general taxation to pay for what is being cut by London. As others have done, I refer members to the NUS campaign on bursaries, which also asks questions that deserve an answer.</p><p>I also refer members to the paper that has been circulated by the Scottish women&#8217;s budget group. It examines the issue of efficiency savings and gives clear reasons why there is a gender implication to them. It mentions the point, which the Government acknowledges, that women will suffer disproportionate job losses in the public sector as a result of the budget, but it notes that there is no evidence of any action, specifically in the sectors in which growth is a stated policy objective, to retrain and equip women with the skills to move into different sectors of the economy. There is a whole host of arguments for opposing the current budget.</p><p>Every political party in the chamber has supported legislative targets on climate change, and every political party in the chamber has at least begun to acknowledge the realities and challenges that will come with peak oil. If we are serious about the commitments that we have made on those issues, it is necessary to re-engineer a huge amount of our built environment, transport system, energy system and economy. That cannot happen without investment.</p><p>If we are serious about our commitments on social justice and about the need to create a more equal society and to reverse the trends&#8212;recognising that the gap between rich and poor grew wider when the economy was growing and then grew wider again in recession&#8212;and if we are serious about wellbeing and quality of life in our society, we must have public investment in many of the urgent priorities.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-26", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22643155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 5) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "During the current parliamentary session and the previous one under the previous Executive, there were times when I supported the Scottish budget, times when I opposed it, and times when I abstained.

Is there any other subject that we could bring to the Parliament for debate in the current context that would not be completely overshadowed by the public spending cuts? The cuts that the United Kingdom Government is imposing, to which the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament must respond, would dominate a debate on higher education, on housing, on poverty and inequality, on health services, and on jobs and the economy. Is there a subject that is not affected, indeed overshadowed, by that context? Every subject that we could debate is profoundly affected.</p><p>That context is the first great test of devolution. It is the first great test of whether the hopes and aspirations of the many thousands of people who campaigned long and hard for a Scottish Parliament are to be realised or ignored. People did not put in those years and decades of work to campaign for a Scottish Parliament to give members jobs. They did not campaign long and hard so that there would be a weekly First Minister&#8217;s question time on television and they would be able to get angry and rant at the telly. They did not even campaign long and hard for a Scottish Parliament simply out of a sense of national identity.</p><p>The profound reason why this Parliament exists and why we debate issues in this chamber week in and week out is a desire on the part of the Scottish people, after the scandal of the poll tax and the years of Tory cuts and privatisation, for a Parliament that would be able to defend Scotland against that right-wing agenda, should it ever come to power again.</p><p>Well, that is no longer a theory; it is a reality. The UK now has a Government that is imposing a radical right-wing agenda of cuts, for which it has no mandate and which was never in the manifestos of the Tories or the Liberals&#8212;the Government certainly has no mandate for its agenda in Scotland. The agenda is ideologically driven by many people on the right of the Tory party, who have for years been gagging for an opportunity such as they now have. It is clear that it will impact on the poorest in society. We are not &#8220;all in this together&#8221;; the Osbornes and the Cleggs will be well protected from the effects of the cuts that they are imposing on the rest of us.</p><p>Even if we set aside the Green interpretation of economics, with which most members who are present disagree, and consider the issue in conventional economic terms, it is clear that the slashing of hundreds of thousands&#8212;perhaps even a million&#8212;jobs, which will be destroyed because of the cuts in spending in the public sector and the knock-on effects in the private sector, is wildly economically risky.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament needs to oppose that agenda. If we are to do so we need not only the power but the political will to do so. The Scottish National Party often makes the case that we need more powers and more economic levers at our fingertips if we are to pursue a political agenda in the face of opposition from the UK. The Labour case currently seems to be that more powers are on their way, through the recommendations of the Calman commission on Scottish devolution and the Scotland Bill, which has Labour support at UK level. As for the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, they will not oppose the coalition&#8217;s agenda, because it is their agenda.</p><p>We have no idea whether the Calman powers would help. In any case it is likely to be years before we can use them. As for the SNP&#8217;s call for more powers, the Green response is that we have never successfully and creatively used the powers that we have. One such power&#8212;the first that is mentioned in the motion&#8212;is the Scottish variable rate of income tax, which was democratically endorsed by the public in a referendum, but which successive Governments have failed to maintain. I know that it would not be popular to use the SVR, but if we cannot use it now, when public services and the very principles that underlie the welfare state are under attack as they never have been, when can we use it? In November the Parliament agreed to a Labour amendment that said that the Parliament</p><p>&#8220;considers it an abuse of power for the Scottish Government to abandon the Scottish variable rate of tax ... considers it unacceptable for ministers to mislead the Parliament ... and calls on the Scottish Government to admit responsibility for the lapse of the tax varying powers&#8221;.</p><p>However, the amendment said nothing about what should be done to fix the situation. My motion therefore calls on the Scottish Government to open negotiations with the UK Government to restore the functionality of the power.</p><p>Use of the power might not be necessary. Greens have suggested other options. In the short term, raising revenue on empty properties could bring in something in the region of &#163;75 million and removing council tax discounts for empty and second homes could add a little more to that total. Scotland is the only part of the UK that is still giving a tax break for urban blight; using that power differently would not only bring in revenue to protect services but reduce rental costs for viable businesses, which could take up those premises. In the longer term, our land value tax proposals could bring in &#163;1.5 billion more than the council tax and business rates that they would replace, which could be used in the first instance to protect services. We would eventually have the freedom to reduce either LVT or income tax through the Scottish variable rate.</p><p>The underlying theme must be the empowerment of local councils to make their own decisions. John Swinney and his colleagues continually call for financial powers and I often sympathise with their call, but we can create these powers for ourselves if we empower local authorities. Beyond that, we could explore local authorities&#8217; ability to borrow, which is an ability that the Scottish Government does not currently have.</p><p>During the debate many members will focus on household budgets and the cost of housing, energy, transport, food and so on. Green policies, and many policies that have taken hold across the political spectrum, would help to reduce all those costs, but that cannot happen without investment and commitment from Government. We need to have the political will to raise revenue to defend Scotland against the UK Government&#8217;s agenda. It is not just about the powers that are available; it is about having the political will to use them.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament calls on ministers to open discussions in good faith with their UK counterparts regarding the prompt re-establishment of the democratically endorsed Scottish variable rate of income tax; believes that the UK Government's cuts agenda is ideologically driven, economically illiterate and will have a disproportionate impact on poorer people both in Scotland and in the rest of the UK; rejects the Scottish Government's decision simply to hand on these cuts to Scottish public services, with housing, energy efficiency and public transport particularly at threat; believes that the terms of the proposed council tax freeze reduce local authorities' ability to make their own democratic decisions and look at alternatives to cutting vital local services, and urges the Scottish Government to revise the draft budget to reduce these cuts by incorporating progressive ways to raise revenue at a local level within the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament to ensure that wealthier people pay more and poorer people pay less, including options such as land value tax, a hotel bed tax and reducing exemptions to the uniform business rate.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22642786", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protecting Public Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As the smallest party in the Parliament, the Greens quite rarely have the opportunity to bring motions to the Parliament for debate, so what topic to choose for our limited time is always a difficult decision.

He described them as going too far and too fast in reducing the public debt. I argue that the UK Government is focusing too much on cuts and not enough on raising tax progressively and fairly, including from the private sector.</p><p>For decades, we have had the lie in UK politics that we can have European standards of public services and pay American levels of tax. That lie cannot last any longer. It is clear that the UK coalition wants American levels of both. I think that Scotland would rather go a different way. If we do not do that, it will raise the question, what is the Parliament here for if we are only willing to pass on the cuts? If John Swinney intends to play the role of the pre-devolution Scottish secretary, acting as the UK&#8217;s man in Edinburgh, he will be making a great mistake. He will greatly regret coming to be seen as George Osborne&#8217;s man in Edinburgh.</p><p>Michael McMahon and Stewart Stevenson both expressed understandable concern that any tax increases would hit hardest the pockets of ordinary people. That is a concern and we should take it seriously, but such tax rises are not the only choice for raising revenue. The Scotland Act 1998 gives us the power to raise revenue to fund local services. It does not say that that has to be done through the council tax or that it has to hit ordinary households the hardest. The two examples that I mentioned, which cover untaxed business assets, should be part of the mix. Even changing the council tax to add upper bands would affect only the wealthiest. We should be exploring all those options.</p><p>Derek Brownlee reminded me of one of my most serious slips of the tongue. I am not sure, but I might have been tired and emotional on the day when I described him as progressive. He reminded me of that, then he suggested that I should follow Hazel Blears&#8217;s example. Perhaps he is working to a different definition of progressive from the one that I use. He also expressed concern about the impact of tax rises, but he seems oblivious to the impact that the cuts to services will have on the poorest and most vulnerable people in society.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis talked about the scale of the deficit. I can only assume that he fully endorses the UK Government&#8217;s policy to shift the burden to individuals, for example by writing off corporate tax bills and refusing to restore progressive income tax. He was particularly keen not to have his rant about Comhaontas Glas, the Green Party in Ireland, interrupted, despite the questions that he directed at me. It is strange that he lodged an amendment that welcomes the fact that the Government is talking less about Ireland these days but then used most of his speech to talk about Ireland.</p><p>I can only assume that, in holding me to account for the actions of Comhaontas Glas, despite my having no formal links with it, he is keen to be held fully to account for all the actions of the UK coalition, or indeed for those of any political party anywhere in the world with the word &#8220;liberal&#8221; in its name. Perhaps he would like me to hold him responsible for the actions of the German Free Democratic Party, which is also in coalition with the right wing and whose popularity is in free fall. It is trying to force through tax cuts and ban the burqa&#8212;an illiberal position that it shares with the Dutch liberals the VVD, or the People&#8217;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, which is sharing Government with the racist party of Geert Wilders. Perhaps he would not like to be held to account for those actions, though.</p><p>Ross Finnie said that my speech suggested that I was thirled to an ideology. I do not think that ideology is a dirty word in politics. It has been missing from our managerial politics for far too long. The question, though, is what ideology? Is it the free-market fixation that has failed us so badly or something different, which, I think, is what Scots wanted when they set up this place? I agree entirely with Mr Finnie&#8217;s comments on the folly of chasing rising property prices, but they suggest that he should be supporting our land value tax proposals.</p><p>I remind the chamber that the cause of the deficit and the recession was market failure of historic proportions, yet the victims of the cuts will be ordinary citizens and communities. Mary Mulligan said that the right took the financial crisis as an opportunity; in fact, the left, too, should have taken it as an opportunity to challenge and overturn the failed socially and environmentally destructive and brutally unfair deregulated free market ideology that has been dominant in this country for far too long now. That opportunity could still be taken; after all, Labour and the SNP both compete for a centre-left profile. This Parliament should be capable of ensuring that Scotland&#8217;s politics forge a successful and strong left response to the current situation. Of course, parties have to compete, but they should do so by setting out progressive and constructive ideas instead of simply blaming one another for the cuts while doing nothing about them.</p><p>In my opening speech, I listed the other topics that we could have brought for debate&#8212;education, health, jobs, housing, poverty and inequality&#8212;and said that each would have been overshadowed by the cuts. However, I go further and say that each cut will restore the giant evils that Sir William Beveridge identified: want, squalor, disease, ignorance and idleness. Even if today&#8217;s language has changed, the fact is that the cuts will revive those giant evils and, indeed, will make them worse. A generation that had to cope with massive deficit and debt built up the welfare state and we should not permit the Cameron generation to use this opportunity to tear it down. If we do, we again beg the question of what we are actually here for.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "22642786", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Protecting Public Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "John Swinney began by expressing sympathy for my core argument that the UK cuts are on the wrong scale and at the wrong time, and that they are socially damaging.

I was happy to sign up to it almost as soon as it was lodged, and if the measure of cross-party support that has been built up so far can persuade the Government to change its position, that will be extremely constructive.</p><p>The freight action plan, which is available at the back of the chamber, was published before the current Administration came into office, so the current minister clearly cannot be held accountable for every word of its contents. However, it does give an accurate description of where things stood before the decision that we are debating today was made. Four grant schemes are listed, of which the freight facilities grant scheme is the principal one. It is clearly the principal means by which the previous Administration and the current one have attempted to achieve their stated objective to get modal shift in freight.</p><p>That is where we have to begin&#8212;with a recognition that no other mechanisms are being talked about. Chris Harvie's description of the experience in Germany included some sticks as well as some carrots, with some restriction on road freight. I do not think that I will surprise anybody by <place-holder colnum=\"32286\"/> saying that I would be quite comfortable if we were talking about that as well as about some carrots, but the fact is that the Government has not brought in those alternatives.</p><p>I suspect that if the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth had come to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee a few weeks ago and said, \"We don't think the freight facilities grant is working as it should, so here are some options for improving it,\" the committee would have found that a welcome conversation to have, and we might have had our own ideas about how it could be improved. However, that discussion did not happen. There was no discussion about how to improve the grant.</p><p>The cabinet secretary did say that the money had not been spent and that it had been difficult to get the money out the door, and he also complained about the budget reductions that the Government is suffering. I sympathise with that, but those things do not, in themselves, form a rationale for abolishing or closing to new applicants a scheme that is, as I said, the principal mechanism by which Government can achieve its stated objective. Instead, they form a rationale for asking how we can make the scheme better.</p><p>The size of the overall budget is not the only issue, albeit that it is, of course, an important one. The size of the cake is one important issue, but how it is sliced up is also important. Year after year, our committee has complained about the share of the transport budget that goes to increasing capacity and locking in high-carbon behaviour as opposed to assisting a transformation to low-carbon behaviour.</p><p>As Transform Scotland has argued, scrapping this grant scheme appears wholly inconsistent with the Government's policy objectives on climate change, sustainable economic development, environmental protection and road safety. That is one reason why such a broad range of voices is speaking out against the decision. We have heard business voices speaking out, as well as trade union voices, environmental voices and the voices of transport experts and a range of others. In the face of all of that, it seems astonishing that, instead of trying to make the scheme better, the Government has simply decided to abolish it.</p><p>I will close by talking about \"Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies\", which we debated earlier this week and which is the Government's plan for meeting its climate change objectives. The report talks about financial</p><p class=\"indent\">\"incentives to encourage modal shift\".</p><p>If that is the direction in which we are going, how can we approve a budget that takes us in the <place-holder colnum=\"32287\"/> wrong direction?

She was quite right about that, and what she said gives me hope that we will have constructive discussions with her when she comes to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee. However, we should acknowledge that not everyone is yet convinced of that. For example, reducing transport demand and increasing the proportion of journeys that are taken by foot and by bike will have health, safety and economic benefits and just make our communities nicer places to be in, but many people still perceive that agenda as a threat, not an opportunity. That reinforces the importance of the public engagement strategy.</p><p>The minister and Rob Gibson were at pains to emphasise the spending constraints that the Scottish Government is under. The minister asked members to say how they would fund additional proposals if they sought them. I am happy to say&#8212;as I suspect the minister is&#8212;that I am opposed to the cuts agenda. I do not support the UK Government's decision to reduce the Scottish Government's grant and I want progressive taxation to play a bigger role. However, even if it <place-holder colnum=\"32072\"/> does not play a bigger role and we have to accept the UK Government's agenda, and even if other parties in the Parliament do not support increasing taxation, it is about not only the amount of money that we spend but the priorities. For example, budget after budget, the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee has agreed unanimous recommendations that we should increase the proportion of the transport budget&#8212;not only the size of the cake but the share of it&#8212;that goes to sustainable and active travel as well as public transport.</p><p>The same argument is made on energy efficiency. Around a third of the energy efficiency budget has been cut&#8212;&#163;48 million for the energy assistance package and the home insulation scheme is around a third down on last year&#8212;but it is one of the best-value and most effective ways of bringing social, economic and environmental benefits together. It simply has not had the priority that it needs, as not only the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee but the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee has repeatedly said.</p><p>The minister says that we require the stronger EU target of 30 per cent and, if it is not forthcoming, we will have to consider other options. I am afraid that that is worryingly ambiguous. Many thousands of Scots campaigned hard for the targets in the 2009 act because the science required them. I suspect that those Scots will accept a weaker target only if the science justifies it.</p><p>I will spend most of my closing speech talking about the issue of the voluntary versus the regulatory approach, to which many members referred.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw rarely fails to engage full frontal with the substance of the debate before us. Even if we often find ourselves on the opposite sides of the debate when he does so, I appreciate his engagement. He says that some people are still not convinced about climate science. I happily acknowledge that that is a statement of reality. There are still some people who deny the science of evolution but, by doing so, they make themselves irrelevant to a discussion of biology. The Delingpoles and Plimers of the world make themselves irrelevant to a debate about climate change by denying the science.</p><p>There are also many people&#8212;many of us&#8212;who are convinced of the science but, as Jackson Carlaw says, do not yet fully understand the consequences of reaching our targets. I hold up my hands and say that I cannot tell anybody here what a zero-carbon or low-carbon world is like. No economies in the history of humanity have ever achieved it. We know that we will get some things <place-holder colnum=\"32073\"/> wrong along the way, but the science dictates that we must make every effort.</p><p>Jackson Carlaw suggested that a regulatory approach implies that a voluntary approach will fail, but sometimes voluntary approaches do fail. Voluntary approaches on reducing smog, reducing acid rain, cutting out chlorofluorocarbons and a wide range of other environmental improvements over the decades had to be accompanied by regulation. The market did provide more efficient cars, but it did not provide lower fuel consumption because, when cars became more efficient, we started to use them more, so fuel consumption went up.</p><p>Markets are very good at meeting demands but, when environmental costs can be externalised, they are bad at living within environmental limits. If, one day, a fully functional, robust and meaningfully valued carbon price operated, encompassing the whole economy, perhaps a market approach might achieve the emissions cuts. However, I suspect that it would do so with an incalculable and unacceptable social cost and even a non-carbon environmental cost that most of us, I think, would not be willing to tolerate.</p><p>Beyond the environmental sphere, much of the social progress that has been made over the generations has happened only with both public engagement&#8212;the hearts-and-minds approach&#8212;and regulation. In the workplace, whether we are talking about holiday pay, sick leave, equal pay for men and women, ending discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, the minimum wage or a host of other issues, we would have got nowhere without a regulatory approach as well. The truth is that we won the public argument on those issues by achieving progress, and we needed regulation to get us there.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1: \"Report on Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry that I will not have time to respond to all the members who made points in the debate.

The draft RPP is one of a suite of documents published under the low-carbon Scotland heading. The documents are fundamentally interconnected, and I am sure that we will be able to discuss aspects relating to many of them and not just the draft RPP. Many of the points that members raise during the debate, as well as the recommendations in the committee's report, will form the basis of Parliament's response to the Government's draft RPP. I hope that that will be reflected in the final version that the Government publishes in the near future.</p><p>I thank everyone who gave evidence to the committee in person and in writing. I thank my fellow committee members for their contributions, and our clerking team for their work in producing a report in a short timescale. I thank the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee for its valuable contribution on the energy section of the draft RPP.</p><p>The draft RPP sets out proposals as well as policies that the Government believes will help it to meet the annual carbon emission reduction targets to 2022 and beyond, from the 42 per cent target by 2020, consistently with the long-term 80 per cent target. We can recall the ambition that was talked of when Parliament set what the Government rightly calls world-leading targets. We did so not just constructively but broadly consensually. There are few parliamentary chambers around the world in which the issue of climate change has led to all political parties in an elected assembly seeking to strengthen legislation rather than undermine it. We can take some pride in ourselves for that.</p><p>We can also welcome the Government's publication of the draft RPP and acknowledge the great deal of work that has been put into the <place-holder colnum=\"32039\"/> document over the past 18 months, and the engagement with external stakeholders.</p><p>I have a couple of concerns to raise that are reflected in the committee's recommendations. The first of those concerns is on the timing of the publication, which proved to be a problem in that not only did the 60-day statutory period for parliamentary scrutiny include a parliamentary recess, which made the timescale tight, but it took place at the same time as scrutiny of the Scottish budget. When RPPs are published in the future, it is therefore important that that is done at a time that allows for the highest possible level of parliamentary scrutiny within the statutory period.</p><p>As we make progress towards the emissions reduction that we have all signed up for, we will come to find that scrutiny of progress on the RPP is every bit as important as scrutiny on any other indicators of progress in our economy. A Finance Committee would not accept only limited scrutiny of a Scottish budget. Future Scottish climate change committees should not expect such a shortened, constrained process either. We will be happy to discuss the practicalities of that with ministers, if they are willing.</p><p>So much for the timing; what of the content of the draft report? Some witnesses expressed concern over the scope of and balance between existing, adopted policies and proposals for new policies that have not yet been adopted. A range of views was expressed. Many witnesses argued that the policies that the draft report contains are, broadly speaking, a summary of existing policy, not anything radically new or unexpected. They suggested that the proposals that are included in the draft report, which might at some future point be adopted as policies, were less radical than the proposals that were included in some earlier drafts of the RPP.</p><p>It is clear that the emissions reduction targets will be met only if both the proposals and the policies that are contained in the document are adopted and successfully implemented. The RPP specifically states that the proposals do not reflect current Government policy. My view, and that of many witnesses, is that a clear step forward would have been preferable, with a sense of direction rather than a summary of where we are now.</p><p>The committee recommended that the Scottish Government must, as a matter of urgency, assess and evaluate each of the proposals and decide which of them will become Government policy. When we see the final RPP, the committee expects it to contain an indicative timescale for carrying out that work. We further expect that the subsequent RPP, which is due to be published towards the end of this calendar year, will provide clear evidence of that analysis.<place-holder colnum=\"32040\"/></p><p>Other improvements could be made, and the committee has called for those to take place&#8212;with, I have to acknowledge, two members dissenting. The committee agreed by majority that failure criteria should be included for the voluntary measures in the RPP. That reflects concern over the balance between voluntary and mandatory or regulatory approaches. The idea of relying on voluntary measures is not inherently a bad one. We want the measures to be something in which the whole of Scotland chooses to participate, because they will lead to a better quality of life and because people see an incentive and a desire for that. We must be clear about what would represent the failure of a voluntary approach&#8212;if we achieve only 50, 60 or 70 per cent of the emissions reduction that is hoped for under a voluntary approach, we must be clear what the failure criteria would be. How could we move to a more assertive approach?</p><p>As I have pointed out, the timescale for scrutinising the document was tight, and we did not have time to look in great detail at the cost estimate for specific proposals and policies. That was compounded by the fact that we were scrutinising the draft budget at the same time, which meant that both the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee and the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee had to deal with major pieces of scrutiny concurrently. Both committees have argued that, as a result, the scrutiny of the documents was not as comprehensive as it might have been. Both Government and Parliament need to co-operate to do better in future.</p><p>Yearly budgets, as well as longer-term spending plans, must be consistent with our approach on reducing carbon emissions. I cite some of the evidence from Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, which has repeated its evidence in a briefing for all members today. It discusses</p><p class=\"indent\">\"funded support for the introduction of road traffic demand management measures\",</p><p>as well as funded proposals on active travel&#8212;walking and cycling&#8212;which has been long neglected, and which, during scrutiny of previous Scottish budgets, our committee has repeatedly argued needs a clearer focus, with more consistent funding. The Stop Climate Chaos briefing also mentions</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Greater funding for home energy efficiency\".</p><p>It says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"SCCS is calling for a commitment of &#163;100 million per year for a universal home insulation scheme and 'soft' loans package\".</p><p>Those are not new ideas, but it is clear that we will not achieve the emissions reductions unless our budgets and long-term spending plans are <place-holder colnum=\"32041\"/> consistent. Other witnesses argued that there is insufficient alignment between the draft budget for the coming year and the RPP. The freight facilities grant, which will be debated later this week, is an example that members might want to raise.</p><p>There is little benefit in setting challenging objectives and making ambitious estimates of the reductions that we can achieve if Government budgets, not just under the current Administration but long into the future&#8212;up to the 2020 and 2050 targets and beyond&#8212;do not contain sufficient financial provision to allow delivery.</p><p>There is a further challenge to the Government. The committee agreed that the final version of the RPP must include a clear statement of what the Government will do if the European Union does not adopt a 30 per cent target, as we hope that it will do. If that happens, there will be greater challenges for Scotland in meeting our legally binding targets, but that will not be an excuse to abandon the targets.</p><p>The RPP is part of a suite of low-carbon-Scotland documents, the weight of which is burdening my desk&#8212;I am holding up only a sample. One of the most important documents that we will consider is the public engagement strategy. It will be vital that we move the debate on from the cosy language of consensus. On climate change, we have had centuries of ignorance of the damage that human economic activity was causing our environment, followed by generations of denial of the damage. Denial still exists in some quarters but is less strong in Scotland. We have had decades of inaction, even after the science became clear, and years of debate. The years of debate have led to a measure of consensus, but we need to move on, through public engagement, to convince Scotland that we need a radically different approach to reducing our emissions. An 80 per cent cut is not a few trimmings and does not require small, incremental measures. We must convince Scotland that a radically different approach is in people's interests, so that all Scotland will sign up to it.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament endorses the recommendations contained in the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's 9th Report, 2010 (Session 3):<em> Report on Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies</em> (SP Paper 554) and agrees that this report, together with the <em>Official Report</em> of the Parliament's debate on the report, should form the Parliament's response to the Scottish Government on the Draft Report on Proposals and Policies.</p>", "hdate": "2011-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21175933", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Autism (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1: \"Report on Low Carbon Scotland: The Draft Report on Proposals and Policies\""}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am happy to open the debate on behalf of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee and to discuss the report that the committee has published on the Government's draft report on proposals and policies to reach the targets outlined in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.

People have made that case, but the Government's proposal purportedly does not support it. Allegedly, the Government says that the existing bridge will become a public transport corridor only. Jackson Carlaw was perfectly right and honest to say that that position is absurd. The idea that the same commuters will queue up for the same amount of time on the same day to get over a bridge with the same road capacity and will spend the same amount of their lives in traffic jams getting stressed just the same without looking over their shoulders and saying, \"Open the bridge,\" is absurd.

The Constitutional Convention, which many members have mentioned, should have been the template for an involving, inclusive and welcoming process in which the whole of Scotland could have participated.

Over the years, both members have moved the debate on significantly and, even if today is not the last word, the chamber should thank them.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis referred to some of the religious arguments that have been advanced on the issue, and Margo MacDonald referred to the support that she has received from good churchgoers. Of course, we are aware that many in the churches have expressed their views directly to the Parliament about how the idea of assisted suicide fits or does not fit with their belief system.</p><p>I could stand here and make a speech about my belief system and how it relates to the bill and the ideas that it contains, but surely the point is that the democratic institution of the Parliament should not privilege any particular belief system and impose it on those who do not subscribe to it. Religious belief or subscription to a doctrine can be the basis of a person's moral life; they might value it highly, and we should all respect that. However, our society and the secular authority of the Parliament must not become a means of imposing such a religious position on everyone. Our authority does not come from a deity or a holy book, even for those of us who believe in deities and holy books. Our authority comes from the electorate.</p><p>So the only way in which I can begin my argument is with the principle that a life belongs to the person who is living it. It does not belong to anyone else. People approach difficult choices such as how to face and whether to take control of the end of their life in different ways, based on their values and beliefs. In reply to Michael Matheson, I say that I have never heard anyone argue that assisted suicide is the only way of achieving a dignified death. The only central argument is that each of us is the one who is best qualified to make that decision in respect of our own life.</p><p>On the principle of autonomy, the law is of course needed because people sometimes make choices that wider society cannot tolerate, generally because of some harm inflicted on other people. Suicide used to be regarded in that way&#8212;not tolerated and not legal&#8212;but that is no longer the case. We mourn a suicide. We question ourselves, or at least we should. We question our society about the causes and contributory factors, and we try to improve wellbeing in society. I hope, however, that none of us would want to regard suicide as an offence.<place-holder colnum=\"31066\"/></p><p>For any person to take control at the end of their own life, on their own terms, may be regretted and grieved over and may be distressing and traumatic for other people, but I cannot see why it should be criminal, even if that person needs to ask for help from someone who is willing to give it in a context of care.</p><p>Many people have argued that the law must protect people against the risk that they might feel pressure to make a choice that they do not really want to make or that they would not otherwise make. That is a genuine concern, but let us remember that by rejecting the bill we would leave people in exactly that position. People who wish to make one choice would be told that they may not. They would not be allowed to ask for help; they would certainly not be given it. People who wish to make the choice would be told that they must either go abroad to do it, if they have the money and ability to do so, or must risk criminalising the friends, family or others from whom they seek help.</p><p>Does that respect anyone's autonomy? Does that protect people from the pressure that they come under to make a choice that they find intolerable and that they do not wish to make? The risk that someone could come under pressure to end their life prematurely when that is not their preference is very serious and we should not take it lightly, but nor should we take lightly the serious risk, and the reality, that people are under pressure to make the other choice when they would wish to take the option of assisted suicide.</p><p>Some people will no doubt continue to travel overseas to make the choice. My final comment is that the absence of any vociferous call for those people to be chased down and prosecuted for travelling overseas for an illegal purpose suggests to me that we do not consider those people to be criminals. We do not consider them to be people who pose a threat to others or wider society. If we did, as for travel overseas for other illegal purposes, we would prosecute them. We do not, so let us stop treating them as criminals.</p><p>Let us recognise that this is a debate and vote on the general principles of the bill. If we want to debate the detail and whether the safeguards should be amended, we should support the general principles at decision time tonight.

I have never worked in a local authority or the NHS, but I have worked in the voluntary sector in an organisation that had a funding mix, from voluntary and charitable sources as well as the local authority, the health board and central Government. My experience was of scrabbling around, sometimes for years and sometimes for shorter periods, for the next grant or bit of funding, always spending a third of my time evaluating the work that I had done, another third seeking the next bit of funding and only a third of my time getting to do my job. Such short-term funding gave rise to huge frustration as well as a great deal of inefficiency. We were not able to plan properly or apply long-term forward thinking to either the ideas that informed our work or the way in which we structured our organisation.</p><p>There will be a huge amount of frustration out there in many parts of the public sector and in the organisations that depend on and work with the public sector about the short-term thinking that is going on. We know that many people will be forced to make short-term decisions that they know will not be the right ones in the long term. Nobody wants to be in that situation and I suspect that John Swinney would like to find himself in a situation in which he could give greater long-term clarity.</p><p>What are the arguments that John Swinney has used against giving that clarity? The central one is about the Christie commission. He has argued that we must look at restructuring public services in a deep and fundamental way and that, before we know the recommendations that the Christie commission will come up with, it would be wrong to set budgets that will have to change. I query the timing of all that. The recommendations from the Christie commission might well be very useful; some good ideas might come out of it. However, priorities will also be set by the election results next year, by manifesto commitments, by the political balance in the next parliamentary session and by whichever party or parties happen to be running the Administration in the next session. The Christie commission will emerge with its recommendations a couple of months after that. I think that the cabinet secretary said that the <place-holder colnum=\"30879\"/> commission was due to report in June. There is no reason to expect that radical change in the structure of public services, if that is what the Christie commission recommends, will see both political agreement among parties and legislative action to implement it, if that is necessary, in time for next year's budget process.</p><p>Long-term changes might well be needed in parts of the public sector, but we will budget for them when we know what they are going to be. Until then, we have to allow the public sector to plan. The sector will need to bear in mind the possible future political decisions and choices that might be made, but it should not be left in limbo in the meantime. In that sense, there is at the very least no reason for not publishing the following year's figures in advance, and I agree with members' comments about publishing figures for the CSR period.</p><p>John Swinney stressed his record of compromising and working with other political parties in successive budgets. I absolutely agree that on some issues there has been very good compromise. The Greens have taken many ideas into the budget process, and the Government has taken up quite a number of them&#8212;although we have not entirely agreed with every detail of implementation. However, that very process of negotiation and compromise will have to happen in relation to manifesto commitments when we see the results of the election, ideas from the Christie commission and, indeed, ideas from elsewhere.</p><p>I agree with Johann Lamont that if we are talking about that long-term context, we need to give the public sector greater clarity now. After all, we know neither the commission's recommendations nor the political results of our debate about them. Nevertheless, I hope that at the same time Johann Lamont agrees that a budget for Scotland's people will need to listen to people during and after the election and that, in that respect, the most important message was given 13 years ago when two thirds of Scotland's voters voted yes, yes to a Parliament with tax-varying powers. I think that Scotland's people knew then that at some point in the future they would again see a right-wing Government they did not vote for inflicting an ideological attack on public services, and they wanted a Parliament that was capable of defending Scotland against such an agenda.</p><p>A budget for Scotland's people would not slash the housing budget in the final years before our shared commitment to ending homelessness is due to be met. It would not freeze public sector pay, which, after all, is equivalent to an arbitrary tax on those employees, including many low-paid workers. It would not cut funding for higher and further education, arts and culture, the voluntary <place-holder colnum=\"30880\"/> sector and public transport. Indeed, it would not simply hand on a series of Tory cuts that no one, not even Tory and Liberal voters, actually voted for. A budget for Scotland's people would oppose that ideological, anti-state agenda by raising revenue progressively and fairly. We can do that in Scotland by empowering our councils to do it locally and in time by using the SVR or the Calman powers. If we mean a word of our speeches about social justice, public services, a greener economy and a more equal society, we must agree that that is the kind of budget for Scotland's people that we need.</p>", "hdate": "2010-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21103848", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: A Budget for Scotland's People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Several members have reflected on their experiences of working in parts of the public sector, whether in local councils, the NHS or elsewhere.

Regardless of political party, not everyone who takes a central part in any Government can gain the respect of people in all political parties, even when differences arise. As <place-holder colnum=\"30747\"/> every member knows, I have not always voted the way John Swinney would have liked and there have been times when, to his regret and mine, I have tried and been unable to reach agreement with him. I hope that he understands the respect that he has gained during his time in office. If we were to ask people to list the decent and capable people in the current Administration, we would find John Swinney at the top of many of those lists. However, in conveying the respect that he has gained over the past few years, I also state my hope that, by the time this debate is over, he understands the anger that even some of those who have respected him bring to this debate as a result of his actions and, indeed, inactions.</p><p>I do not want this debate to be seen as a debate between the Labour Party and the SNP; it is, most centrally, a debate between Government and Parliament. Both sides in the debate have a detailed narrative about which Governments said what or did what at what time, but I am clear that, soon after coming to power in 2007, the current Scottish Government understood very clearly that this situation was developing and was not being resolved. Why was I, as a member of Parliament, not told at that time? Earlier, Stewart Maxwell said that everyone in the Opposition parties should have said which budget the money was to come from if we wanted it to be paid. I would have been delighted to have the opportunity to say what I think ought to have been the priority&#8212;but I was not told.</p><p>Regardless of political parties, I would have expected any finance secretary in any new Administration in 2007 to have kicked up a storm of anger in explaining that the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government were unable to exercise the Scottish variable rate power within the expected time period. That should have been put into the political sphere, and it is outrageous to be told now that it was inappropriate for it to be in the political sphere. The issue should have been debated in the political sphere, among MSPs.</p><p>If the cabinet secretary is still listening, I will contrast his response in his opening remarks with Nicola Sturgeon's response when she was under pressure to apologise for a misjudgment. She apologised sincerely, calmly and constructively. I would like the cabinet secretary to reflect on that in his closing remarks, to acknowledge calmly and sincerely that some of the judgments were wrong, and to say sorry.</p><p>However, I would like more than that. This is not just about blame, about who said what, or about who was responsible; it is also about solutions. It is about ensuring that, in future&#8212;not just when an Administration is formed in May by whoever&#8212;the powers that exist on paper under the current legislation or under the new Scotland bill that we <place-holder colnum=\"30748\"/> expect to be introduced soon at Westminster are exercisable in practice. I want there to be a series of practical steps that the cabinet secretary will take over the next few weeks and a commitment from him to report back soon to Parliament on the progress that he is making in turning a paper power into a practical power as soon as possible.</p><p>I was not a politician in 1997, when we were all asked to vote on whether the Parliament and this dysfunctional industry of ours should be set up. I was not even a member of a political party when I was asked to vote. Like around two thirds of the electorate, I voted yes and yes. I did so not because I thought that the SVR power was the only or even the best financial power that we could have; rather, I wanted a Parliament that had at least the potential to defend Scotland against attacks on the public sector from a hypothetical, future right-wing Government, for which I was confident Scotland would not have voted.

Both of those important areas will be under increasing attack. Today, London has seen one expression of the justified anger against that attack; I am sure that it will not be the last.</p><p>I want to make two broad points. The first concerns evidence-based policy, which has become a catchphrase that is a little bit too easy to use. Just today, we saw a debate in which the two largest parties brought to the Parliament new ideas for policy measures on alcohol but in which each attacked the other based on thin evidence. Evidence-based policy is important, but it is only one factor. We should not be afraid of testing a new idea simply on the basis that it has not yet been tried. Anything that has not yet been tried will be subject to criticism that there is not enough evidence, but if we argue that evidence-based policy is the only requirement, we will end up with inherently conservative approaches to every subject.<place-holder colnum=\"30279\"/></p><p>However, if evidence-based policy were given the status that we say it should be given, in each of our political parties, right across the spectrum, we would have reached for our copy of \"The Spirit Level\", looked at the objective evidence for more economic equality and social solidarity, and brought those concepts front and centre in our political response to the unprecedented free- market failure of recent years. That has not happened. We must ask what the place of objective, evidence-based policy is if we have failed to listen to the arguments that are outlined in \"The Spirit Level\".</p><p>My second point concerns the</p><p class=\"indent\">\"pupil and student participation in science\"</p><p>to which the motion refers. Currently, there is a threat to the participation of pupils, in particular, in science. The place of a scientific world view is generally agreed by all, yet that fundamental world view is under attack.</p><p>I congratulate the bloggers of \"The Twenty-first Floor\" for drawing attention to the fact that, recently, an organisation called the Centre for Intelligent Design opened in Glasgow. The group's director is quoted in <em>The Herald</em> as saying that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it was 'inevitable' that the debate would make its way into schools\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"that he had already been asked to speak in Scottish schools, and agreed to do so.\"</p><p>In the same article, a Scottish Government spokesman is quoted as stating only that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we do not recognise the teaching of intelligent design in a scientific context\".</p><p>In their responses, neither the Government nor Learning and Teaching Scotland give any indication that they have in place measures to prevent that material from entering schools.</p><p>It is some 85 years since the Scopes monkey trial in the US.

That is the estimate of the industry and it is an estimate that I would endorse. Only a fraction of the cut from &#163;2 billion to &#163;1 billion in the green investment bank is replaced by the fossil fuel levy. We need to recognise that objectively, whichever way we cut the deck of cards, the investment going in is a reduction on what we had been led to expect.</p><p>Gavin Brown said that the fossil fuel levy money has lain dormant in an account year after year. Sadly, it will continue to do so. That is an issue of urgency. Several members have talked about the <place-holder colnum=\"29735\"/> reasons why renewable energy is an urgent area for investment and why we will not exploit the opportunities that exist unless we get the investment in place now. Wendy Alexander and Duncan McNeil made points along those lines. Wendy Alexander talked about the importance of port infrastructure and, in particular, why investment in that area is so urgent. We will miss out on the opportunities offered by marine renewables unless we get that investment in place soon.</p><p>Duncan McNeil made some hugely important points and reminded us of the need to ensure that all of Scotland can benefit from opportunities in renewables. Renewable energy could be a renewable economy opportunity, particularly in the west of Scotland. Jobs on the Clyde and elsewhere could be genuinely sustainable, rather than the economy limping from one military contract to another, going through an eternal cycle of threat and reprieve.</p><p>My amendment introduces the phrase \"sleight-of-hand\". That mood seems to have caught on. Even Gavin Brown joined in when he described Stewart Stevenson as \"a man of magic\". I am not sure that I would go that far. However, other members have used terms such as \"conjuring trick\", \"con\" and \"smoke and mirrors\" to describe the actions of the UK Government. Sleight of hand often works by distracting the eye. We can all be pretty confident that the Lib Dem-Tory attempt to distract us all from the fact that their agenda is monumentally one of vicious cuts will fail completely over the coming months.</p><p>On the wider debate, we should be asking ourselves what renewable energy is for. Some regard it merely as a great new industry from which jobs and gross domestic product can come. It is, but it is much more than that. It is about transforming our energy system, such that we are helped to meet our carbon emission targets. However, wind turbines going round or renewable energy devices operating in the sea&#8212;whatever they end up looking like&#8212;will not in themselves cut carbon. What they will do, in that tired old phrase, is to help to keep the lights on.</p><p>If we saw the renewable energy opportunity as part of the transformation of our energy system, we would be talking about real investment, including, as Chris Harvie mentioned, public sector investment and community-owned infrastructure. We would be talking about the huge amount of money that will be made in the sector and saying, \"Let's keep some of that for the common good, not just for the private sector.\" It would be accompanied by investment in demand reduction, decentralisation and disinvestment in coal, oil, tar sands and nuclear&#8212;the dead-end technologies of the past.<place-holder colnum=\"29736\"/></p><p>I urge members to support all the amendments.</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21041363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "At one point in Stewart Stevenson's speech, he seemed to be quoting from something described as the Liberal Democrat manifesto.

Once upon a time, not so long ago, only the Greens and a handful of environmentalists were banging the drum for renewables; now the issue is up there in some shape or form on every political party's agenda. That is very much to be welcomed. The down side of that, I suppose, is that any issue that is recognised as important across the political spectrum can turn into a bit of a political football. What is astonishing is the low standard at which political football is currently being played in this country.</p><p>It is obvious that there are huge differences between the Green and Tory-Lib Dem approaches to many of the issues that face the country, including issues that impact on renewables. We would not be pursuing a dramatic cuts agenda. We would be imposing a financial transactions tax and we would be returning to progressive income taxation, to secure real investment in priority areas, including renewables. We would be considering the already publicly owned banks, such as the Royal Bank of Scotland, which hugely overshadow the small amount of investment that will be put into the green investment bank, and we would be looking to turn those existing public banks into green investment banks. The Lib Dem way, on the other hand, is to slash spending, not only across the board but particularly on energy efficiency schemes, ditch the party's opposition to nuclear power and offer rhetoric on renewables investment but, objectively, less money to invest.</p><p>Let us consider the green investment bank, as Lewis Macdonald did. Previously, it was a &#163;2 billion scheme, but now it is a &#163;1 billion scheme. It is still a drop in the ocean compared to the capital investment that publicly owned banks are putting into other, dirtier forms of energy. There is still no detail on the bank's operation and a great delay in the timing, as the Government amendment notes. We will see not a penny of the money this year or <place-holder colnum=\"29724\"/> next year, when the public sector and the wider economy need the investment most urgently.</p><p>The fossil fuel levy is, objectively, already allocated to Scotland. We should just get it spent. If the rules prevent us from spending it now, we should change them. The two parties in front of me are running the UK Government, like it or not. They have it within their power to change the rules now and allow the fossil fuel levy to be spent immediately. Instead, money is being shuffled around. There are cuts upon cuts on the block grant and sleight of hand. Sleight of hand ought at least to be convincing, but there is no danger of Danny Alexander or Michael Moore being accepted into the Magic Circle on the basis of their performance to date.</p><p>The real agenda should be investment, not cuts. We should also be talking about public ownership and community ownership of at least a proportion of our energy generating capacity. I await with interest the Scottish Water bill from the Scottish Government to see what that can do in the way of publicly owned energy generation. An urgent transformation is needed.</p><p>We need to ditch oil and coal. Renewable energy does not cut carbon emissions; burning less of the fossil fuels does. Renewable energy will meet our need for energy once we burn less of the fossil fuels but, while the UK Government still commits to projects such as deep-water oil drilling, it will have zero credibility on the transformation of our energy system.</p><p>I move amendment S3M-7269.1.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"believes that, by cutting the money available to the green investment bank, replacing a small proportion of this cut with money already set aside for investment in Scotland and then further cutting the Scottish block grant if this money is actually spent in Scotland, the UK Government is attempting a transparent act of sleight-of-hand that the Scottish Liberal Democrats should be ashamed to support.\"</p>", "hdate": "2010-10-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "21041363", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Renewable Energy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "The tone of Liam McArthur's speech suggested that he is a little disappointed that the rest of us are not cheerleading for the Liberal-Tory Administration but are being a tad critical of it.

What was the right thing to do with the order? Would it advance the case to reject the order and demand that the Government came back to Parliament with something better? The decision was finely balanced. However, as others have indicated, the 14 million tonnes of additional CO2-equivalent reductions that will be achieved over the course of the targets justify Parliament's decision to reject the original order. Let us be clear: the 14 million tonnes represent not more cars off the road, more homes insulated or more waste reduction in our system, but the effect of calculating in the recession. That is overwhelmingly the case; it is not the effect of new policy. That said, we must live with the targets, regardless of future economic growth. The improvement is therefore a good one.</p><p>What is frustrating, particularly from a Government that is nearing the end of its first full term in office, is the continued lack of early action in the first few years, 2010 to 2012. The order that the Parliament rejected had a reduction of around 836,000 tonnes in those first three years. The order that we are debating today has a reduction of about half that, or 426,000 tonnes.

I hope so, because there will not be much else to look forward to in the comprehensive spending review.

He explored some of the statistics and situations in Glasgow's health record that are familiar to all of us and which have been debated on numerous occasions. Some of the issues are historic, of long standing and culturally rooted in aspects of Glasgow's behaviour that all of us can identify.</p><p>The statistics for physical and mental health are stark. I would also like to mention sexual health, which is significantly worrying in Glasgow and the west of Scotland compared with other parts of the United Kingdom and Europe. On this day of all days, I can barely resist the suggestion that we add another target to Glas-goals&#8212;for Glaswegians to use a million condoms over the next year. I cannot think of anyone who could object to such a target for Glasgow. Perhaps those Glasgow members who are not here with us tonight can raise the issue wherever they happen to be.</p><p>Some of Glasgow's ill health&#8212;some of it less serious, but much of it chronic&#8212;can be attributed to individual behaviour around smoking, drinking, eating and exercise. Some can be associated with the environment; environmental inequality has a clear impact on public health. Some is attributable to economic factors. The complex relationships between health inequalities and economic inequality are still a growing area of work; much research is happening, and there are lessons that we have not yet fully understood.</p><p>Another issue is the way in which messages proliferate in our society. A public health campaign or a health promotion budget is relatively small compared with the vast marketing budgets of organisations that promote unhealthy activity, whether those be burger bars, drinks companies, tobacco companies or promoters of processed food. The scale of the marketing budget that goes on telling us all to eat unhealthily, to drive everywhere instead of walking and to pursue such unhealthy activities is astonishing, and it is <place-holder colnum=\"28734\"/> extremely difficult for people who work in public health to get over that.</p><p>Information needs to be provided as part of any public health campaign but, increasingly, information is available in bucketfuls&#8212;many people are bombarded left, right and centre with messages about what to do, what to eat, where to exercise and so on. Another aspect of such campaigns is access and opportunity. As well as access to fresh and nutritious food, people need access to places that feel safe and pleasant to walk, cycle or run in. The third element is motivation&#8212;people have to want the thing that is being suggested to them. Public health campaigns must not be seen as finger-wagging exercises that tell people how they should live their life, whether they like it or not; they must be motivating. In that regard, I think that the Glas-goals campaign is extremely positive because it has an upbeat, \"Yes we can\" spirit to it. It is aspirational; it is about seeing what more we can do for ourselves.</p><p>My final point is about what more our public bodies&#8212;local authorities and health boards&#8212;could do with their land. One of the impacts of devolution has been a land reform agenda that has sought to capture the idea that land is part of the common good. In Glasgow, there is an eight-year waiting list for allotments. In Glasgow, most tenement back courts have in no way been designed to be pleasant, enjoyable spaces for playing in, enjoying the open air or growing food.</p><p>A huge amount could be done by exploring concepts such as landshare, which involves linking up people who want to grow with people or organisations that have some land. Local food production has environmental benefits, and people acting together and taking part in a collective enterprise results in better community links. On top of that, people can save some money on their weekly shopping bill.</p><p>The production of fresh, healthy, nutritious, home-grown fruit and veg gives people great-quality exercise with other people and is brilliant for physical and mental health. I would love to see Glasgow City Council, the health board and other public bodies that have wee bits of land here, there and everywhere opening them up to allow members of the public to turn them into productive land. That would help with our food supply, which the previous debate dealt with, and it would help the public health situation in Glasgow.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20997506", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glas-goals"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, congratulate Bill Butler on bringing the motion to the chamber.

I am not in any way opposed to the research that is going on, with support from Government funding, to find out whether we can make CCS work. However, as well as not being opposed to the development of CCS technology, I am not yet convinced about it. It is a fundamentally new area, which no one has yet been able to show is going to be viable.</p><p>The debate that we had on 18 March was mentioned earlier. I hope that it was not only because it was my birthday that members chose to support my amendment in that debate, because it raised serious concerns about the viability of the technology. An abstract from a paper in the <em>Journal of Petroleum Science &amp; Engineering</em>, which I made available to members for that debate, suggested that the potential for sequestration has been wildly overassessed. It also suggested that, given the necessity of storing CO2 in a closed system, unlike when we were trying to get oil or gas out, when the pressure under the earth or under the ocean allowed us to extract it easily, in this case the pressure will make it increasingly difficult to pump material in. The result of that is that the practical capacity for storage is much lower than the physical capacity suggests. The paper suggests that between 50 and 200 times more underground reservoir volume would be required to store the CO2 from fossil fuel combustion than has been envisaged. It states:<place-holder colnum=\"28582\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"it renders geologic sequestration of CO2 a profoundly non-feasible option for the management of CO2 emissions.\"</p><p>That is only one research paper; many others are being written elsewhere. No doubt, all arguments on this are beyond the specialist expertise of anybody in the chamber. However, the paper tells me that this is not a closed question. We do not yet know whether the technology can be made to work.</p><p>Lewis Macdonald said that the potential for CCS at new coal plants might exist at some point in the future and that that might be some years away. Yes it might. It also might never happen. We have to acknowledge both those possibilities. CCS technology might be incredibly useful for the world or it might not happen. We cannot put all our eggs in that basket.</p><p>Annabel Goldie said in her speech that she endorsed the ambition for Scotland to become a world leader in so-called clean coal technology. There is a huge risk in placing our hopes in such a speculative technology. I commend to members the objections raised by Christian Aid, as well as the other non-governmental organisations that have circulated material for the debate tonight.</p><p>CCS technology is a speculation. We cannot place our faith and trust in it.

In general, I find it hard to find much enthusiasm for the motion or the amendments. Undoubtedly some good work is happening as part of the road to recovery strategy. I do not doubt that for a moment. I also do not doubt some of the original intentions behind the strategy. Government emphasis on the use of the term \"recovery\" is an attempt to break the conceptual barrier between harm reduction and abstinence and the polarised debate that we have had in the past. However, it is not clear that that has been successful. There is still an undertone of refusing to view any type of recreational drug use as part of any kind of normal life.</p><p>For some people, abstinence is still an ideal that should drive policy in this area. As a Green party MSP, I welcome a bit of idealism in politics; I am not opposed to that. However, I cannot say that I share that particular ideal, and nor do many of the advocates of abstinence&#8212;I have seen many of them enjoying a glass or two of wine, a beer or a few whiskies. There is a dishonesty and a contradiction&#8212;even sometimes a hypocrisy&#8212;about our society's approach to recreational drug use.</p><p>Scotland's most common, widely available, profitable and harmful recreational drug&#8212;of which I am an enthusiastic user&#8212;is the subject of continual debate in the chamber, in relation to <place-holder colnum=\"28539\"/> harm reduction, licensing, taxation and even minimum pricing; yet almost nobody advocates the prohibition of alcohol, or even abstinence as a policy message. As many speeches are made in the chamber about protecting&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;the drinks industry and our independent pubs as are made about the public health issues that alcohol raises. There is a tension there, but not a contradiction.</p><p>Most of us recognise that alcohol&#8212;that recreational drug&#8212;is, while harmful, acceptable and can be part of a normal life. There is no attempt to suggest that all use of alcohol is misuse, so why do we get that type of approach with other drugs? Why do we not see the same honesty in the debate on other drugs?</p><p>I will quote someone who I must admit I rarely quote: the Labour politician Eric Joyce. In a comment that was headed, \"Politicians lie about drugs because pretty much everyone else does\", he wrote:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The banning of methodrone just before the ... election, agreed by all parties, was a perfect illustration of how the drugs lie operates. Two people were found dead having consumed a bunch of substances\"&#8212;</p><p>including methodrone. He continued:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It turns out that neither of the post-mortems in this case revealed ... even a trace of methodrone. The legislation was of course simply designed to make everyone feel good about fighting the scourge of drugs while actually doing nothing of ... real value about it.\"</p><p>Later in the piece he says,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I don't advocate drugs legalisation\",</p><p>so he does not share all of my views on the subject, but I think that we would both conclude that we need a more honest debate about the options before us.</p><p>That honest debate is beginning to happen, for example in Portugal. In 2001, Portugal became the first European country to abolish criminal penalties for personal drug possession. In addition, drug users were to be targeted with therapy rather than prison sentences. We must underline the point that there is no contradiction between the harm reduction approach and recovery, which the Scottish Government emphasises. Since Portugal introduced that policy, the number of overdoses and drug deaths&#8212;and the number of HIV cases among injecting drug users&#8212;has reduced significantly.</p><p>In California, there will be a public ballot in November&#8212;at the same time as the mid-term elections&#8212;on legalising and controlling cannabis in the same way as alcohol, so that adults who are 21 or over will be able to possess up to 1oz for consumption at home or in licensed business establishments.

He might point out that that styling was Crawford Beveridge's idea, but members should not allow the repetition. The document that we all know as the Beveridge report identified five giant evils in society&#8212;squalor, ignorance, want, idleness and disease&#8212;and laid the foundations of the welfare state. It was and remains a source of pride to anyone with a social conscience. The Liberal-Tory cuts agenda to which the budget review is a response will increase each one of those five giant evils. Even if it is found in Scotland's constrained and limited form of government that, regardless of which party happens to be in power, some elements of the budget review become unavoidable, they should be a source of pride to nobody, regardless of party politics.</p><p>The UK Government has choices at its disposal, and there are decisions that it can make. This is a matter of a set of choices, not necessity. As George Foulkes said, the UK Government can slow down. Even if there is a desire to reduce the deficit over time, that does not need to be done with the zeal for public sector cuts that leave many of us with the suspicion, which we can hardly be blamed for, that the approach is simply opportunism by the radical right, who hate the public sector for ideological reasons and care little for equality and social justice. Other cuts can be made. The things that we do not need can be cut, from weapons of war to the legions of private sector consultants who siphon public funds and the absurd levels of high pay at the top end. I include in that the pay of politicians such as us. We are all paid more than &#163;50,000 a year, and I sometimes think that some of us have forgotten that that is a hell of a lot of money to most people. Consideration of public sector pay at the top end should include consideration of our pay.</p><p>There are other choices in raising revenue.

As members know&#8212;I have said it on many occasions over the past three and a half years&#8212;I had hoped that a more radical programme would be implemented than the one that we have seen. Nonetheless, Mike Rumbles would do well to remember that the coming election could be an opportunity for voters to pass judgment on his party colleagues, and their colleagues at Westminster, on the Liberal-Tory cuts agenda that is being pursued&#8212;an agenda that I think is vigorously opposed by a clear majority in the Parliament and in Scotland as a whole. Different choices can be made, and we would make them if we were able to, whether that is slower deficit reduction or the imposition of new, creative approaches to raising revenue, such as a financial transaction tax&#8212;a Robin Hood tax. The election result that Mike Rumbles looks at next year might well be the one that his party deserves.</p><p>Even in Scotland, within the limitations of the devolution settlement, there are choices that we can make as we face that difficult process of working through the Liberal-Tory cuts agenda, and decisions that we can make in the short term.

Some of that has come up today and I will address the remarks on Scottish Water later; some of it will be addressed tomorrow when we debate the independent budget review.<place-holder colnum=\"28292\"/></p><p>As ever with a legislative programme debate, there are some bills that I welcome and others that I do not, and there are some issues that have not been addressed. I welcome the opportunity to look at the private sector housing bill and perhaps to improve it when it comes along. We can do a great deal more not only to enhance tenants' rights but to ensure that tenants who currently are not practically able to access their existing rights are given some support, both when a minority of landlords act outwith the law and when bad landlords provide an unacceptably poor service but stay just about within the law. There is also room in the bill for a more aggressive approach to permit the management of properties to be taken over when owners cannot or will not provide a decent service. That issue will have to come up the agenda if social housing is, as many of us expect, hit hard by cuts in the capital budget.</p><p>A bill that gives me slightly more concern is the one on double jeopardy. I will, of course, read it and judge it when I look at the detail, but there are clear, principled reasons why the rule against double jeopardy is important and why it has stood for so long. Members, including Richard Baker, talked about the outrage that is felt when wrongful acquittals happen, but the danger is that abolishing the rule against double jeopardy also gives rise to the risk of wrongful conviction. Wrongful conviction is a more serious wrong than wrongful acquittal, because wrongful conviction means that not only is the wrong person sentenced and their life destroyed by a period in jail, but the person who is guilty of the offence walks free.</p>", "hdate": "2010-09-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20976559", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been said that when a political leader expresses full confidence in one of their colleagues, that colleague needs to worry.

The bill that never was also needs some reference. There are, of course, arguments for and against a referendum. Many people, whether they wish to vote yes or no, would like the opportunity to vote. The SNP's rationale for dropping the measure, even if it might be understandable and sympathised with by its back <place-holder colnum=\"28293\"/> benchers, will not be remembered. What will be remembered is the moment when it missed its chance. The Labour Party careering about between one policy and another on a referendum was embarrassing, but there was that moment of \"bring it on\". The opportunity was given, the door was opened for a brief period and the SNP decided not to go through; it did not take that chance. I am afraid that that is what will be remembered: the first period in office of a pro-independence Government that did not take the chance when it had it. Why not? The conclusion that many people will reach is that the SNP did not believe that it could win the argument.</p><p>The First Minister's stated priorities in Government over the years to come&#8212;or the year to come and, he hopes, a little longer than that&#8212;are economic recovery, a low-carbon Scotland and protecting public services. He mentioned economic recovery, but people listening to his comments on jobs would be forgiven for thinking that we were in the middle of a boom, rather than coming through a difficult recession. He prioritises a low-carbon Scotland, even though he remains wedded to a hugely damaging road-building programme at a time when it must compete with low-carbon transport schemes for a declining capital budget. He mentions as a third priority protecting public services. Well, we must await the Scottish budget to see the extent of that commitment, but let us be clear that that cannot be done without looking at revenue and finding more creative ways to fund those services.</p><p>I come to the First Minister's suggestion that a public sector approach to energy generation through an expansion of the business activities of Scottish Water is one way to do it. Alex Johnstone expressed an anti-public-sector ideology, but members will not find any opposition from me to the idea of a public sector energy generator. However, let us not be under the illusion that it can be done with a snap of the fingers. It is a long-term agenda. It could be a profoundly important agenda, but it is not going to give us more than limited opportunities over the next few years, and that is when the Liberal and Tory cuts will start to bite. In the meantime, investment in the modernisation of water infrastructure will continue to require substantial amounts of public money, so we are still left with serious, real long-term problems.</p><p>On the new nationalist pitch that we heard from the First Minister&#8212;not \"It's Scotland's oil\" but \"It's Scotland's renewable energy\"&#8212;I have a lot of sympathy with the principle, but Scotland's energy does not have to mean only the Scottish Government's energy or the public sector's energy. There appears to be no place in the First Minister's vision for community ownership of energy so that people, households, communities <place-holder colnum=\"28294\"/> and independent local businesses can gain not only the financial benefit of renewable energy but also the resilience to meet their own energy needs long into the future to as great an extent as they can. That is a capacity that will serve them well not only in the short term, as we look to rising energy prices, but as we look to the long-term challenges of the 21st century and the move away from oil as we go past the peak of production.

I apologise for having added my name to the motion only today at this late stage, but she can be assured of my support.</p><p>Pauline McNeill and other members have mentioned the affection in which the Glasgow subway is held, so let me just ponder the roots of why the system is held in such affection. My memories of the subway go back only to around the time following the 1970s refurbishment. As a poorly child, I was frequently taken into Glasgow to attend Yorkhill hospital, so the little bit of the journey that went from Partick to the subway station at Kelvinhall and back again was always a bit of highlight.</p><p>Whenever I was taken into Glasgow as a child, I always looked forward to that ride on the subway. Part of the reason why we have these feelings about the subway is to do with some of its shortcomings. The fact that it is just one little loop is kind of charming&#8212;it is charmingly modest. The small size of the rolling stock is also a problem in some ways. It makes new rolling stock hard to find and more expensive to procure, as the SPT report suggests, but it also increases the affection that we feel for it. Again, the vehicles are kind of charming. Far be it from me to suggest that everything that is small in size is big on charm, but there is something in that.</p><p>That affection is strong, but many people who use the subway are increasingly aware that the system has seen better days and desperately needs investment. As Robert Brown would, I would love it if we could replace what we have with something like the Copenhagen system, but let us be realistic; that would not be modernisation. To achieve that kind of system, we would have to rip it out and start again, and we would have to spend much more substantial amounts of money. I would love it if we could do that, but while the political landscape is still committed to spending billions on the road building programme instead of on public transport, I am not hopeful that we will get that sort of commitment. I am, however, hopeful that we can get the proposed modernisation programme approved. For years, Glasgow's public transport has lost out to the road-building programme that takes up the bulk of capital spending, and has seen the cancellation of the Glasgow airport rail link, which Scottish National Party members said was a vital part of the future of the west of Scotland's transport system, while crossrail is still struggling to gain the <place-holder colnum=\"27548\"/> backing that it deserves from a Government of any complexion.</p><p>There are positive points to welcome in the proposal, certainly around the refurbishment of rolling stock and stations, integrated ticketing and improvements in accessibility, which is something that we need to achieve. We could go further, even within the limitations that we face. The project ought to consider energy. An underground infrastructure should be able to pump energy up to the buildings on the surface. Heat-pump technology could be an environmental benefit and a source of revenue to the owners and operators of the subway. Improvements to passenger comfort and services such as wi-fi should be cheap, easy and relatively simple to do in a small system.</p><p>Ultimately, I would like to see the system expanded, extended, and integrated with cycle routes and so on. If that kind of money and political backing is going to be available, it will require Scottish Government recognition that Glasgow's subway is nationally important. That is long overdue, and I look for the minister to confirm that tonight.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20853302", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow's Subway"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Like others, I add my thanks and welcome to Pauline McNeill for lodging the motion.

Domestic abuse and domestic violence are always wrong, in all circumstances. Members of all parties can agree on that.</p><p>I used to work as a youth worker, supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people, so I can testify to the wide range of experiences of domestic abuse and violence that young people, as well as adults, experience in domestic relationships of all kinds. I think that members of all parties acknowledge that, too.</p><p>We can also all agree that there have been big and welcome improvements over the years in the legislation and in services such as policing, social work, family support and victim support. The new helpline represents not day 1 of a new agenda but the next appropriate and reasonable step in the gradual improvement of the way in which we deal with all the issues. We can and have all welcomed that.</p><p>However, we should also all recognise that there is a good reason why we have traditionally brought debates to the chamber that focus on violence against women. It is centrally important to recognise that there is long-standing and deep-seated inequality in our society, particularly gender inequality, which underpins a huge amount of domestic violence and abuse, and that the problem of such abuse has to be understood in gender terms, no matter who the victim is, if it is to be fully understood both in scale and in nature. It is also important to stress that those who have advocated for many years the gendered analysis have never sought to undermine or ignore male victims of situations that are not posed in terms of male violence against women. The briefings that all members have received from the organisations that have advocated that gendered position make that clear.</p><p>I welcome and endorse much of Johann Lamont's emphasis on seeing this debate in complementary terms and not setting one group of victims against another. Her explanation of the relevance of the gendered analysis to issues for young men&#8212;for example, the ways in which they experience, engage in and relate to violence&#8212;was absolutely spot on. However, I sometimes disagree with Labour's specific proposals on issues such as minimum sentencing, which I think risk doing more harm than good. It does not help, from a gendered point of view, if we take a frightened wee boy and turn him out of prison a <place-holder colnum=\"27266\"/> few months later with him convinced that he is a hard wee man.</p><p>I want to make a point about domestic violence and abuse in same-sex relationships and say why the gendered analysis is relevant to those situations. Such circumstances are often cited by those who argue against a specific gendered analysis of the issue, which in the view of some people mistakenly sees or recognises only male violence against women. I have been working in the Parliament for about seven years, so it is a while since I have professionally supported or counselled people in same-sex relationships who experience violence or abuse. However, I have to say that I do not remember a single case where the experience of working with those people did not bring up issues around internalised homophobia: the ugly but all too common phenomenon of people turning society's homophobia and prejudice inward and against themselves or their partners. Where does that homophobia come from? Where does it originate? Very clearly, I would argue, it originates in the social and cultural enforcement and policing of gender roles, and in global terms a relatively modern and western binary model of gender that ultimately is delusional. The gendered analysis is therefore absolutely crucial, no matter who the victim is, and is always relevant to women and to men in mixed-sex relationships or any relationships.</p><p>Scottish Women's Aid, which is one of the organisations that have advocated that position, states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"A gender based analysis of domestic abuse is not just about defining 'who does what to whom' and it does not assume that abusers are always men and victims always women. It seeks to understand the context, meaning and impact of the abuse and how the abuse of individual men and women impacts differently on women, as a group, and men, as a group.\"</p><p>I think that all members in the chamber should be able to support that and agree with it.</p><p>It would be wrong for the Parliament to agree a motion that implied or stated that some victims were unimportant or should not be offered support, but it would be equally wrong to agree a motion that had nothing to say about the gendered aspects of domestic abuse and domestic violence. I will therefore be very happy to support Johann Lamont's amendment. Mike Rumbles earlier passionately argued&#8212;I know that he is sincere about this&#8212;that this is not simply a gender issue. Well, of course it is not&#8212;gender is not simple and the gender inequalities in our society are not simple. This is complexly a gender issue. We must agree on the vital need for support and justice no matter who the victim is. However, we must also recognise that the gendered aspects of the issue are central, no matter who the victim is, and we <place-holder colnum=\"27267\"/> should reflect that in the motion by agreeing the Labour amendment.</p>", "hdate": "2010-06-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20829057", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Violence Against Men"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am slightly disappointed by the confrontational nature of the debate, given that there is so much on which we all ought to agree.

It was partly because the cycling action plan for Scotland is a continuing piece of work in the Scottish Government and we felt that it was important that the Parliament have the opportunity to contribute to that. However, even before that work got under way, there was widespread recognition that active travel, or walking and cycling&#8212;I was correctly chided by one of our witnesses not to use the jargon&#8212;is a good thing, with a capital G and a capital T.</p><p>Everybody agrees that active travel is a good thing and that we should have more of it. The evidence is increasingly robust that it contributes to many Government policy objectives that are shared across political parties. It has health benefits&#8212;including mental health benefits, the evidence for which has become increasingly clear over recent years. Obviously, it also contributes towards achieving the necessary reductions in CO2 emissions and in transport pollution, which continues to be a problem.</p><p>Active travel would provide economic benefits and opportunities for the economy if we were to <place-holder colnum=\"27086\"/> spend relatively small amounts of money on relatively affordable infrastructure improvements and softer measures. It has the ability to reduce congestion and save money for businesses, individuals and households. In addition, well-used public space leads to better communities and a sense of shared ownership of that space through its shared use. Active travel&#8212;walking and cycling&#8212;can also improve independence, especially for young people. Moreover, as energy issues increasingly come up the agenda and political parties are willing to speak the words \"peak oil\" openly in a way that did not happen only a few years ago, it can contribute to an energy descent path for Scotland.</p><p>This is the first time that a committee of the Scottish Parliament has carried out a major inquiry into active travel. Every other travel mode has received significant attention&#8212;rightly so&#8212;but active travel has not. We must acknowledge the current situation: we have shared aspirations but there is a lack of delivery and provision is patchy at best. We have a great, admirable record to examine in comparable countries&#8212;even countries with similar weather&#8212;but have not reproduced it in Scotland. There is also a consistent lack of funding. Repeatedly, when scrutinising Scottish budgets over recent years, the committee agreed unanimous recommendations that active travel must come up the Government's agenda as a share of transport spending but that has not happened. The inquiry sought to address many of those issues.</p><p>It is also important to recognise that people are not defined by their last, or even most frequent, journey. Almost everybody walks. Drivers walk, train passengers walk, cyclists use the ferry and wheelchair users take the bus. Some walkers even pile their bikes on top of a four-by-four and drive about the country looking for somewhere unspoiled by congestion by other four-by-fours. We all share public space&#8212;roads, pavements, crossings, shopping centres and routes to school&#8212;and have a common interest in resolving any conflicts appropriately. There will always be competing pressure for that public space. At any one time, each of us probably sees the world from the perspective of our immediate transport journeys when we think about our rights and responsibilities.</p><p>So, what themes came out of the inquiry? Many of the cultural attitudes to walking and cycling featured in our evidence sessions. I have already mentioned the weather in that regard, which is sometimes perceived as a barrier to increasing walking and cycling. However, that is not the case in countries with comparable weather patterns. There is also an issue about peer reinforcement and how we perceive other walkers and cyclists. That was mentioned particularly in relation to <place-holder colnum=\"27087\"/> cycling. For example, the contrast between Lycra-clad warriors and ordinary regular commuters was seen as a barrier that makes people feel that they do not want to be a cyclist or to be seen as one. Gender and age issues also came out of the inquiry. It is important to ditch some of the stereotyping in that regard, which unfortunately clouded some of our evidence, and recognise the real factors. For example, who makes decisions about children's travel to school? As well as mums, many dads do that. However, we all recognise that domestic decisions and domestic work are not equally shared between men and women.</p><p>There are workplace issues around the provision of showers and changing facilities, and bike parking. There are also questions about motivation. Just as many people are not necessarily going to respond to a climate change argument that is phrased in terms of parts per million of CO2, many people will not think about the environment as their first reason for wanting to walk or cycle more. Health, fitness and independence are the kind of benefits that need to be stressed.</p><p>On education, we found that it was crucial that young people gain an experience of cycling early on so that they build up the confidence and knowledge to use a bike and cycle routes, and establish a cycling habit early on. That training does not currently appear to be adequate, because insufficient numbers of young people receive it. We need all young people to receive cycle training at school as a matter of course. We have asked the Government to consider a more centrally managed scheme that allows for common standards.</p><p>There were questions about safety and the perception of safety. A large amount of evidence suggested that reducing speed limits on the roads would have a real impact in promoting walking and cycling, as a result of both real safety statistics and the perception of safety, which is important. The wider adoption of 20 mile per hour zones would be very much welcomed.</p><p>Planning and the built environment must have walking and cycling at their very heart. We hear often that there is a hierarchy, but what we see in reality are developments taking place that lock in high carbon options for people. We have recommended that the cycling action plan for Scotland sets out specifically how it proposes to increase awareness and understanding among transport planners and engineers of the needs of walking and cycling.</p><p>Improvements in infrastructure are also essential. We need both dedicated cycling routes&#8212;by dedicated I mean both integrated with the road space and segregated, because different <place-holder colnum=\"27088\"/> solutions will be appropriate in different contexts&#8212;and well-designed and maintained pavements. Some of the discussion that we had during the cold snap about the maintenance of, and damage to, pavements and the lack of gritting is just one example. While individual improvement schemes to the infrastructure as part of the trunk road upgrade can be welcome, they often stand in isolation and are not well linked to other cycle routes in the surrounding area. Having one or two cycle routes is no compensation for having access to the whole transport network. There are also issues around localisation, making better use of the planning system and thinking about where we deliver housing and public services so that people do not have to travel as much and the roads are safer.</p><p>I have to say something about funding. Overwhelmingly, we received strong evidence on the lack of adequate funding, even to reach the Government's 10 per cent target for modal share for cycling. Repeatedly, our committee has recommended along those lines in our budget reports, but those recommendations appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Currently, less than 1 per cent&#8212;some say less than 1 per cent, while the Government says it is slightly more than 1 per cent, but it is in that region&#8212;of the Scottish Government's transport budget is spent on walking and cycling. A representative of the cycle campaign group Spokes told us that they had put together research showing that all the main sources of funding, whether in transport or other budget headings, put us somewhere between &#163;3 and &#163;3.50 per head across Scotland.</p><p>It is not easy to identify a single figure for other European countries, but the range of figures goes from &#163;5 to &#163;25 per head. We are clearly way below that level. Cycling Scotland estimates that the figure in Scotland is &#163;3.30 per capita compared with nearly &#163;23 in Denmark and nearly &#163;27 in Amsterdam.</p><p>Several witnesses argued that the per capita approach should be taken here. Others argued that 10 per cent of the transport budget should be spent on walking and cycling. The committee has not taken a view on which of those two options&#8212;the per capita approach or the percentage share of the transport budget&#8212;is the right one. If we examine them, they both result in similar, substantial increases in funding for walking and cycling. The committee considers that the 10 per cent target for modal share for cycling will be meaningless if the Scottish Government fails to match its ambition with a realistic level of funding that is proportionate to the improvements that it expects to be delivered throughout Scotland. The target is a good aspiration, but it will not be met by magic.<place-holder colnum=\"27089\"/></p><p>The committee has also expressed concern that local authorities will not make active travel a sufficiently high priority, particularly during what might be a prolonged period of economic constraint. If targets for increasing walking and cycling are to be met during such a period, the issue has to be addressed by the Scottish Government. The minister has noted the widespread variation in spending by local authorities. Instead of accepting that as an unavoidable trend, the committee believes that the Scottish Government must find ways in which to address it.</p><p>Strong leadership is vital at both ministerial and other levels in Government. We also argue that the role of agency leadership should be considered. Cycling England appears to have had some success in co-ordinating its role and we wonder whether the Scottish Government should consider a similar approach for Scotland.

Alex Johnstone and others have talked about the value of that consensus, but frankly it is not enough for Government or for Parliament, a year on from the passage of that act and while those long-term aspirations remain mere aspirations, to keep patting ourselves on the back for achieving that consensus, which was only ever built up on the long-term targets but never managed to cover the steps along the way or how to get there.</p><p>We should remember that there are just 10 years in which to achieve that ambitious 42 per cent cut. We need to make urgent progress, and no fair assessment of the order could call it a demonstration of urgency&#8212;quite the reverse. It proposes a flat-line target of no emissions cuts at all for this year, after three years of the Scottish National Party's version of world leadership. It proposes barely any more cuts than that until halfway through the next parliamentary session&#8212;0 per cent, 0.5 per cent, and 1 per cent. Even the fractional addition in 2012, which was brought in after the committee's decision last week, does not feed through to subsequent years.

However, they are also actually lower than the cuts in emissions that we saw during the years before the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 was even written. For several years, we saw something in the ball park of 1 per cent per year cuts.</p><p>This year, progress has stalled. The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 was supposed to accelerate progress but, instead, we are being asked to accept non-existent cuts and a slackening-off of progress. The principle of having annual targets in the act was supposed to hold ministers to account for their actions during their terms of office. Under the order, it seems that we are not to see serious cuts until the next Government and climate change minister, of whichever political party, is in place.

It is not in dispute that there is a need for cross-Forth transport, including road traffic, that there is concern about the corrosion of the cables in the existing bridge, some strength in which has already been lost, or that there is a degree of uncertainty about the effectiveness of dehumidification.</p><p>The minister then moved on to another basis for his case, which is that road traffic volumes over the Forth will not increase. That assertion is in serious doubt, not just because of the contents of the bill or because of the Government's stated policy intentions, but because of political reality. There is another undisputed fact&#8212;the existing bridge can be repaired for a fraction of the cost of building a new bridge. Just as the local political pressure to remove the tolls on the existing bridge built up, so we can all see the scenario if the new bridge goes ahead and on day one queues form, the lines get longer and hot and angry motorists get more and more stressed out in their cars, just as they do now. Instead of arguing for tolls to be removed or for a new bridge, they will look over their shoulders, out of the window, and see an existing bridge that has virtually no traffic on it and which is being maintained at the public expense. We can all hear the call even now. It will be clear no matter which political party provides that day's transport minister: \"Open the bridge!\" There will be no let up until we have doubled the road capacity over the Forth. There is no doubt in my mind that, at that point, the case will be made for not only opening that bridge to road traffic, but repairing it.</p><p>In other words, we are talking about an additional bridge, not a replacement. Joe FitzPatrick acknowledged as much when he spoke about \"an additional Forth crossing\". At least that is more honest than the Government is being in calling it a replacement. The increased road capacity that would be provided is a central part of the environmental case against the bill, but it is not the whole of it. Margaret Smith outlined, quite correctly, some of the local environmental impacts that we should all take extremely seriously.</p><p>As for Alex Johnstone's argument about greater public transport capacity and increased use of public transport, frankly, we do not need a new bridge to achieve that. We could transfer a lot of the cross-Forth traffic from road to public transport even now: freight could go by rail and passengers could go by bus and rail.

I went in to that inquiry a little more sceptical than I was when I came out of it.</p><p>I wondered whether, if we committed &#163;20 billion or &#163;30 billion to one very expensive project, the people who rely on ordinary commuter rail and bus services throughout Scotland might wish that we had instead spent money on their priorities, on which they rely on a daily basis. However, I came out of the inquiry recognising that there is a case&#8212;several cases, in fact&#8212;for high-speed rail, and that if it is to be built, it should be built to Scotland and it should connect to the European network rather than using a fundamentally different technology.</p><p>There is a case based on capacity constraints, as the existing rail network is under severe pressure. There is little doubt that there is an economic case, even though there are three or four different views on the scale of the economic benefit that can be achieved. There is also an environmental case, but it is not the same case. Even if the environmental benefits could be achieved, they will depend on the other action that we take. It is sad that the motion and the three amendments before us fail explicitly to recognise that concern.</p><p>We should make no mistake: there are those who will happily paint their economic argument with a bit of greenwash and not mean a word of it. There are others who may want to do the right thing but have not grasped that high-speed rail must replace, rather than being an addition to, domestic aviation.</p><p>I will quote some of the evidence that we heard in the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee. One witness stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we want increased connectivity across all modes. We started by considering any extra capacity that a high-speed rail line would provide, rather than any trade-offs.\"<place-holder colnum=\"26491\"/></p><p>Another witness said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I do not consider high-speed rail services to be an alternative; I consider them to be an addition\".&#8212;[<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee</em>, 11 November 2008; c 1003.]</p><p>He spoke about the benefit of shifting to high-speed rail from road journeys as well as from aviation.</p><p>It is important that we make a proper comparison with other modes of transport. Research that the Department for Transport carried out in 2007, which takes into account the carbon cost of construction as well as operation, shows that high-speed rail would be less carbon intensive than aviation, but that it would produce more CO2 than either road or conventional rail.</p><p>A great deal has been said about modal shift&#8212;taking journeys out of the skies and putting them on to the rails&#8212;but we must consider where all the future passengers of high-speed rail might come from. If some of them are currently travelling by air and we get them on to the rails, that is all well and good, as long as we follow the logic through and ensure that the airlines do not continue to operate those routes. If the planes keep on flying, the carbon keeps on being emitted. Those emissions will be cut only if the planes do not fly.</p><p>We have heard from some members a case for a new rail route that is nothing more than predict and provide: building capacity for ever-increasing demand. Kenny Gibson deepened that concern when he talked about how we can welcome more and more visitors every year. That concern does not go away; we need to consider the case for using air passenger duty to disincentivise domestic aviation, if that lever is devolved to us.</p><p>There is a case for opposing airport capacity increases, which were approved by the Parliament only last year, and for not using any slots that are freed up for extra long-haul aviation.</p>", "hdate": "2010-05-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20809040", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High-speed Rail"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Stewart Stevenson began the debate by referring to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's report on the potential&#8212;that is a key word&#8212;benefits of high-speed rail.

There are measures that the Scottish Government can take. Alex Neil said that the debate is not all about the Scottish Government, and that we should consider local government, too. The Scottish Government has the power to use the historic concordat, single outcome agreements and so on to ensure that local government is delivering in this respect. The minister said that the Scottish Government cannot control or regulate the private sector. Yes, it can, through procurement&#8212;as Johann Lamont mentioned&#8212;and also through the various agencies.</p><p>Let us consider, for example, the tourism sector and the support that Government agencies give to it. That support could be contingent on the adoption of a living wage. We cannot directly control what the UK Government does but, in many subject areas, we have shown that, when Scotland takes a bold stand, it has an impact across the political culture and among all political parties throughout the rest of the UK. We can give leadership.</p><p>David Whitton asked us to recognise Labour's record on the issue. I entirely do so. I agree with aspects of Andy Kerr's amendment. I entirely agree that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was one of the most seminal pieces of the legislation of the twentieth century in terms of promoting dignity at work\".<place-holder colnum=\"25841\"/></p><p>I hope that David Whitton agrees that the 1998 act in itself is not enough but needs to be built on and developed. An uprated minimum wage of &#163;3.64 per hour is unacceptable. We must acknowledge the age inequality in the minimum wage system.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis's comments were important. He made a case against the council tax freeze. There is a case for and a case against the freeze, and we can have that debate. I might have much sympathy with the argument that Jeremy Purvis made; other members might have less sympathy with it. However, his comments were important for another reason. We must acknowledge that a difficulty that we have arrived at across the political culture is that all political parties, whether they are in government or in opposition, have found themselves painted into a corner. Throughout my life I have heard ministers from the four other political parties that are represented in the chamber today allowing tax to be portrayed ever more starkly as a political villain. We are told that public services are good but tax is bad. That just does not add up. We have had promise after promise of Swedish levels of public spending and public services, with American levels of tax. That cannot work and we should not be in the least surprised that after decades of such talk we have become an ever more unequal society.</p><p>If we are to turn that round and reduce inequality, we need our whole political culture to change. We need greater recognition that tax&#8212;paying collectively for public goods&#8212;is a positive thing in society. On the day when I see a Government-sponsored television campaign that urges people to shop tax avoiders that is backed by as much money as are the campaigns that ask people to inform on benefits cheats, I will know that we have made progress. Far, far more money is lost to the Exchequer through tax avoidance than through people in poverty trying to play the system instead of sitting back and letting the system play them.</p><p>Derek Brownlee acknowledged that inequality is important. However, we must recognise the need for progressive taxation instead of the current system in which vast salaries are paid on the false premise that a tiny group in society have some kind of magical powers and we must not lose the best of the best&#8212;that is a lie and a con and we have to throw it out. If we want a more progressive taxation system, we need to challenge those values.</p><p>Johann Lamont reminded us that there are people in the business community who will take any opportunity to challenge or criticise the minimum wage.</p><p>Political parties, instead of using the UK election campaign to compete on policies to crack down on tax avoiders and bonus junkies, are courting the <place-holder colnum=\"25842\"/> tax avoiders and the companies that they run, as leaders of the business community. The parties are even seeking those people's advice on the tax and national insurance decisions that face us. That is the political culture that we need to throw out if we are to become the more equal society that all members have said on paper that they support.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764332", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I would very much have welcomed his contribution to the debate.

He was very right wing but fun to debate with and keen to persuade the audience that Conservatives care about poverty. I believe him, and I begin the debate by acknowledging, and by asking the whole chamber to acknowledge, that none of us in the Parliament is secretly twirling our moustache and thinking what a great thing poverty is. We all care about it. We have different policies to try to address it, but the concern and anger that exist about the level of poverty in Scotland today should be, and rightly is, shared across the political spectrum.</p><p>However, caring is not enough. Even just finding policies to deal with poverty and people in poverty is not enough. If all that we do is ameliorate the effects of poverty, generation after generation will face the self-same problem. We will allow the same problem to continue to be created year after year, generation after generation, and successive generations of politicians will continue to have to come up with new policies to deal with poverty.</p><p>We must not be distracted from dealing with the underlying structural causes of poverty in the way that we run our economy. We must go beyond that and recognise not only that poverty matters but that inequality matters. It is about not only the level of wealth that people have, but their relative wealth. It is about how well we share wealth in society, not just how much economic growth we achieve as a whole.</p><p>I refer members to the Poverty Alliance briefing that has been circulated. It explains, to those who might not be aware&#8212;some people in Scotland and the United Kingdom who do not personally experience poverty do not always understand or acknowledge it and think that it is perhaps a thing of the past&#8212;that almost 70 per cent of workers in, for example, the hotel and restaurant sector earn less than &#163;7 an hour. As the Poverty Alliance <place-holder colnum=\"25816\"/> points out, three fifths of those workers are women; it also points out the gender inequality that exists in low pay in the retail and wholesale sector and the public sector. What we do not know about is what happens in the contracts that the public sector lets. What happens to the workers who are in the private sector but fulfilling public sector contracts? We do not have enough information about how many of them are low paid.</p><p>There are different ways of calculating a living wage. The Scottish living wage, campaigned on by the Poverty Alliance, trade unions and other organisations, is based on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation minimum income standard. A living wage of &#163;7 an hour would bring 70 per cent of single adults who are currently living below that level up to that standard. There are other options. If the principle of a living wage can be agreed, we will need to look at the level at which it is set, how we increase it in line with rising living standards or inflation, how we uprate it and whether we should change it to a proportion of the average income. There are a number of models, but I hope that we can agree on the principle.</p><p>We are clearly failing to reduce inequality in society. I am sure that members of all political parties will be aware of the arguments made in the book \"The Spirit Level\", which explains why a more equal society is better for everyone&#8212;raising some people up to a safety net at the bottom is not enough; we must have a fundamentally more equal society.</p><p>Our motion recognises a number of things that we have to do to achieve that. We need to return to progressive taxation and end the scandalous situation in which people on very high incomes pay a lower proportion of their income in tax than people on low incomes. We need to tackle high pay as well as low pay if we are going to become a more equal society: one that will increase health and happiness, reduce social problems&#8212;there are too many to list&#8212;and reduce in-work poverty.</p><p>As I said, the organisations involved in the campaign include a number of non-governmental organisations and trade unions, but political support has been expressed in the Parliament and elsewhere. I acknowledge the members' business debate that Frank McAveety led in the chamber not so long ago. The motion was supported by 22 members of political parties&#8212;that support represents a clear majority in the chamber. Some of the quotations from that debate are telling. Frank McAveety recognised that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we will have ... heated debates\"</p><p>in the coming months and years about the difficult economic circumstances to come and the choices that may have to be made. However, he argued that<place-holder colnum=\"25817\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"the fundamental point is that we should ensure that folk are not left behind, particularly those on the lowest rung of our community.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-09-17.19804.2\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 17 September 2009; c 19806.]</citation></p><p>That is crucial&#8212;it is the nub of the issue. We must move beyond the idea of a safety net at the bottom and stop thinking that, as long as people get on to that lower rung and do not fall off it, that is okay. We need to have a society that fundamentally respects the equal dignity of all people. That must be expressed in material as well as non-material terms.</p><p>Fairness is a concept that I think is in every political party's manifesto for the UK election: fairness, fairness, fairness. However, it is a concept that is open to interpretation&#8212;it means different things to different people. We need to be moving towards greater equality. It has never been more objectively clear that the more equal societies around the world are</p><p class=\"indent\">\"happier, healthier, safer and greener\".</p><p>If we want to achieve those social goods, instead of simply hitting the reset button on the failed economic model, we must ensure that what comes out of recovery is fundamentally better than what went before. That means having a more equal society.</p><p>There are many things that the Scottish Government, the UK Government and local government should do&#8212;indeed, some local authorities are doing them, and I am sure that that point will come out later in the debate. The Parliament should endorse the principle that a living wage for all is the least that a rich society such as ours can afford.</p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament recognises that unacceptable levels of poverty and income inequality continue to blight Scotland; notes that the income of the richest 10% of people in Scotland is approximately the same as the total income of the poorest 50%; further notes that, among working-age adults, in-work poverty is still on the increase; believes that a more equal society would be a happier, healthier, safer and greener society and that this must become a core objective of government at all levels, and therefore calls on the UK Government to commit to the immediate introduction of a living wage for all, set at &#163;7 per hour, and on Scottish ministers to bring in this living wage for all public sector workers and employees of public sector contractors and for this change to be funded by tackling high pay in the public sector and by fairer taxation on both high pay and financial transactions.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20764332", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I begin by recalling a hustings organised by the Poverty Alliance that I attended earlier this week, and in particular the Conservative candidate, who was a good, fun, feisty debater.

However, if we are going to get the energy system that we all need in the future, so that bills do not rise too much and so that we meet all our policy targets, we need to get the system right. As I said in my intervention on the minister, let us therefore try to strike the right tone. We must ensure that we maximise the chances of and political momentum for reform of the system. The phrase \"defenders of the status quo\", which was used earlier, was in that sense a little too defensive and confrontational.</p><p>There has been a general recognition&#8212;several members from across the parties have said it&#8212;that we have a system that was designed for an earlier age, one before climate change targets, before the increase in emphasis on renewable energy generation and before the political recognition of peak oil. Let us not forget that peak oil, with all its implications for not only fossil fuel prices&#8212;petrol prices and so on&#8212;but all energy prices over the coming decades, has received political recognition in public.</p><p>This should not be a matter for confrontation, because if we turn it into something confrontational we will fail to make the ambitious and challenging changes to our system that are required. We need some constructive reflection on all aspects of the future of our energy system. I support the Government motion, but we must look beyond the transmission charging regime in isolation and ask wider questions about the whole system. We must ask about not only the proportion of renewables and what it does in <place-holder colnum=\"25501\"/> economic and engineering terms but the balance between large and small generation within the system. Sarah Boyack usefully reminded us&#8212;not for the first time, by any means&#8212;of the importance of microgeneration and the opportunities that exist in that.</p><p>We must also ask questions about the development of the grid and the ownership structure of the energy system. We should not be afraid to ask questions about public, private and community ownership, and the social and economic benefits that could come from community ownership. We must also ask questions about the relative importance of different policy priorities: security of supply, carbon emissions and fuel poverty. We need an energy system that makes it more likely&#8212;we will never get a guarantee on the challenges over the next decades&#8212;that we will achieve our objectives.</p><p>Jim Mather said in his opening remarks&#8212;members will forgive me if I do not have the words exactly right, but I scribbled them down as quickly as I could&#8212;that significant steps had been made in the direction of a low-carbon renewable energy system for Scotland. That overstates a little bit how much progress has been made, although it would probably be understating it if I said that there had been just a few faltering baby steps. The truth is probably somewhere in between Jim Mather's overoptimistic and my overly pessimistic position, but the reality is that we have a great deal further to go than has even been considered. Fundamental questions have not yet been addressed.</p><p>We need to have an ownership structure and regulatory regime for the whole energy system that makes it more likely that we can achieve our renewable energy goals. It is not just about the transmission charging regime. Earlier, Lewis Macdonald and Rob Gibson debated whether energy demand was higher in Scotland due to the weather conditions and poor energy efficiency standards. It is hugely important to have that debate, but it is frustrating that, while we have it, we are still building inefficient, leaky, badly designed homes in Scotland. We are still building homes that will depend on the grid for all their energy for all their lifetime, because we are putting up buildings that simply will not take the kind of retrofit that we can achieve in others. Such buildings will produce none of their own energy. We need to make that a thing of the past. I hope that, in a few decades' time, that fact will be considered a bizarre relic of history. Let us build modern northern European homes and only modern northern European homes, because that is the kind of country that we are.</p>", "hdate": "2010-04-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20763615", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transmission Charging"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "First, I welcome the fact that the Scottish Government decided to introduce a debate on this topic.

The development work should be done and is being done, and it needs and is getting Government support.

When asked what Government was for, the answer was that it was for something called \"sustainable economic growth\". However, the Government never asked, \"What is the purpose of the economy and of economic activity?\" In recent years, all political parties have begun to allude to that question by peppering manifestos and other documents with words such as \"wellbeing\" and \"sustainable\", but the question has never been fully resolved or answered. If it had been, we might have faced recession, and we might now be facing recovery, with a far clearer transformational agenda fit for the 21st century. Fundamentally, we would be challenging the idea that all economic activity is a public good and that all growth is good growth.</p><p>Let us look at last month's updated document, \"The Scottish Economic Recovery Plan: Accelerating Recovery\". I can well imagine the cabinet secretary sitting around with officials, considering how the document should look. Perhaps the first thing he said was, \"Let's big up the green economy,\" for there are many pages at the beginning that talk about the importance of moving to a low-carbon economy. That is all well and good, but even before we get to those pages, some of the flaws can be seen, even creeping in to the cabinet secretary's foreword:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Our commitments on ... carbon capture and storage will help lead to the development of major new industries in Scotland\".</p><p>Well, that may be, but may be is not enough. The possibility of carbon capture and storage is not a promise or a guarantee. I am happy that the Scottish Government is keen to support the development of that industry, but there is no promise of success. It is far too soon to make commitments on the basis of the assumption that CCS will be a success.</p><p>Further on in the first few pages, we read a section on \"Developing a low carbon economy\". Notwithstanding my long-held criticism of the Scottish Government's oil-dependent transport policy, as I mentioned in my earlier intervention, many of those proposals are welcome, even if they remain as yet only on paper. However, on turning the page, the very next thing that we read is a section on \"Supporting internationalisation\", which includes a glowing endorsement of efforts to boost long-distance tourism. Domestic tourism is mentioned briefly with the ghastly word \"staycation\", but it seems to be understood as only a short-term fad that is based on recent economic circumstances. There is little sign that either the Scottish Government or VisitScotland understands that, in the face of peak oil, Scotland's tourism sector will have a strong future only if the Scottish Government helps it to adapt to attract visitors by sustainable modes of transport.<place-holder colnum=\"25247\"/></p><p>And what have we seen just recently? In adverts in national newspapers in England, VisitScotland has teamed up with Ryanair to say, \"Fly to Glasgow Prestwick\", \"Flying to Edinburgh\" and \"Flying to Aberdeen\". We should be reading adverts about how rail fares will be subsidised or cut to encourage people to travel in a sustainable way to come and enjoy the tourist attractions, hotels and so on in Scotland. Instead, people are encouraged to fly to Glasgow Prestwick and Aberdeen for as little as &#163;6. In a recent newspaper article, VisitScotland is quoted as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Let's not forget that sustainability is about much more than being 'green'.\"</p><p>It seems to me that VisitScotland thinks that sustainability is about much less than being green. The idea of teaming up with Ryanair demonstrates that fact. I used to think that only the far right&#8212;such as the United Kingdom Independence Party and the British National Party&#8212;was in denial of climate change, but Ryanair is a far greater and more serious threat to climate change policy.</p><p>Compare that with what the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change, Stewart Stevenson, has told the Parliament on many occasions. For example, he previously stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"We want to lead by example. Continuing from the previous Executive, we want to reduce emissions from our own travel.\"&#8212;<citation id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2007-06-14.732.0\">[<em>Official Report</em>, 14 June 2007; c 734.]</citation></p><p>He went on to say then that he had made a 50 per cent reduction in his use of domestic aviation. If it is right for the transport minister to do that, why is it right that the tourism minister should fund the placing of adverts in English newspapers that encourage people to use domestic aviation even more?</p><p>There are fundamental contradictions between what Government is saying on a sustainable, low-carbon economy and what it is doing, and the other political parties' amendments to the motion give no indication that they have a clearer grasp of the long-term challenge. Too many of these debates boil down to simplistic sloganising&#8212;the Salmond slump versus Gordon Brown's recession. I know that an election campaign is under way, but I genuinely think that very few members of the public take any of that language remotely seriously. They know that it is silly nonsense, so let us please stop using it.</p><p>National insurance, which has been the subject of great debate recently, is mentioned in the Conservative amendment, but no other political party seems to agree with us on the fundamental need for a return to progressive taxation, which has gone completely out of fashion in recent years. What is needed is recognition that the free market-dominated, growth-obsessed but <place-holder colnum=\"25248\"/> increasingly unequal, failed economic model cannot simply be refloated. We need recovery, not the reanimation of a corpse.

I have no doubt that the paper will not be the last word on carbon capture and storage and I agree that research should be undertaken to explore whether the technology is possible. However, let me quote from the abstract of the paper, which was published in the <em>Journal of Petroleum Science &amp; Engineering</em>. It states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Published reports on the potential for sequestration fail to address the necessity of storing CO2 in a closed system. Our calculations suggest that the volume of liquid or supercritical CO2 to be disposed cannot exceed more than about 1% of pore space. This will require from 50 to 200 times more underground reservoir volume than has been envisioned by many, and it renders geologic sequestration of CO2 a profoundly non-feasible option for the management of CO2 emissions.\"</p><p>Under \"Conclusions\", the authors state that the findings of the research do not bode well</p><p class=\"indent\">\"for geologic CO2 sequestration and ... clearly suggest that it is not a practical means to provide any substantive reduction in CO2 emissions, although it has been repeatedly presented as such by others.\"</p><p>As I said, the research paper will not be the last word on CCS, but it throws serious doubt on the technology.</p><p>CCS might work one day, but we do not know that yet. Therefore, it would be quite wrong to approve new coal-fired capacity, whose emissions would be largely unabated even with an element of CCS, simply on the basis of a technology that currently remains speculative and which might&#8212;only might&#8212;be available in future. If CCS does not work, we will be left with the suggestion&#8212;the words are, I think, at least a couple of decades old&#8212;that a recent Friends of the Earth conference heard from Nimmo Bassey, who said simply:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"leave the coal in the hole\".</p><p>Therefore, I am happy to sign Ross Finnie's motion opposing the Hunterston proposal, but that cannot be enough. The Parliament should reject the proposal by agreeing to an amended motion at decision time today.</p><p>On electric vehicles, which have been the subject of much focus during the debate, I agree with much that has been said, especially about charging infrastructure. In our big cities, such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, much of the property is composed of tenemental accommodation. I live on the third floor of a tenement. If I was going to buy a car, why on earth would I buy a car that I could not charge even in my own street? The installation of charging points in such streets is possible&#8212;they could run off street lamp or domestic electricity supply&#8212;but will not be cheap or easy. Thought needs to be given to how it will be done, otherwise no one will buy those much more efficient cars when they come on to the market. I agree that <place-holder colnum=\"24712\"/> opportunities exist for public sector procurement. Changing how we use procurement does not mean spending more money; it means spending it differently.</p><p>On cycling, which Malcolm Chisholm highlighted, some of the small-scale, cheap-and-easy transport measures simply do not have anything like the political momentum behind them that has been given to the most vast, wildly expensive transport projects that will actually make climate change harder to deal with. One example of that is high-speed rail, on which there are two views. Unless we are willing to constrain domestic aviation, high-speed rail will not bring an environmental benefit.

Each time that I make the challenge I am told, \"We must strike a balance, you see, between the environment and the economy,\" as though the latter could possibly exist without depending on the former. The balance is always shifted decisively in favour of short-term and short-sighted economic considerations.</p><p>At the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee meeting on 23 February, Stewart Stevenson responded to my objections to the carbon emissions from the scheme by telling me that he did not recognise the figure of a 9 per cent increase in emissions from this project alone. Well, he should recognise it, because it is from the environmental statement that was published in <place-holder colnum=\"24179\"/> 2007, with which I am sure he is familiar. The figure is in paragraph 58.3.9, if he wants the reference.</p><p>Nobody will be surprised that the Greens remain opposed to this nonsense of a road project, and I will not be surprised if we are the only ones opposed to it, but I ask other members to consider why we are being asked to nod through the road orders when three key questions remain outstanding. First, does the scheme meet the requirements of the Aarhus convention, which this Government claims to support, as did the previous Administration? A complaint is currently under investigation by the Aarhus convention compliance committee, with local campaigners expected to give evidence in the coming weeks. Secondly, does the scheme breach the habitats directive? Again, a complaint has been deemed admissible and accepted and, in this case, the European Commission is investigating. Thirdly, and perhaps what is most important, how much will the scheme cost? Its final price tag&#8212;either the burden on council tax payers or on the Scottish budget&#8212;is unknown and uncapped.</p><p>On any one of those three grounds, the decision to go ahead with the scheme is premature. That is quite apart from the wider question of a sustainable transport policy and whether any Scottish Administration will ever have one. The decision to go ahead has been taken before we consider the prospect of a judicial review, on which I know the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change feels unable to comment.</p><p>The Green view is clear: the road is a bad idea and should not be built.

I have argued that, as introduced, it appeared to have been written before the economic recession and even before the adoption of climate change targets, but we have given clarity on what is needed.</p><p>At stage 1, I was pleased to welcome the announcement of a &#163;10 million fund for the marine renewables sector&#8212;something that I hope every political party is able to support. However, we have also argued, as we did last year, that a universal national insulation programme is&#8212;and was then&#8212;the cheapest, quickest and easiest way to secure carbon cuts, cut people's fuel bills and protect jobs in a vulnerable sector. I am pleased to say that there is progress, not only on the scale of the insulation scheme that the Government announced last year, which in 2010-11 will be spending &#163;21 million, given the rollover of underspend from the current year, but in an additional &#163;10 million scheme, working on the universal basis for which we have consistently argued. There have been far too many years of means-tested schemes that target and miss those in fuel poverty.</p><p>In addition, there is the boiler scrappage scheme, which must not be a simple carbon copy of the UK scheme. It must achieve the same objectives but be tailored to fit with and complement the existing money being spent on boilers in Scotland.</p><p>I will say something about two of the asks from other political parties.

If we need to improve it to prevent the Government from avoiding it, we can. We have the Parliament's Finance committee and the SPICe financial scrutiny unit. We also have audit machinery. I do not see what the requirement for publication adds beyond, perhaps, a string of easy headlines for the <em>Daily Mail</em>, the <em>Daily Express </em>and others, especially the Conservatives, who seem to be licking their chops in anticipation of those fun, fun, cuts to come in public services.</p><p>Finally, I have never been the biggest fan of GARL, although I have been willing to work with the Labour Party to see what could be done.

Perhaps it is because, although I can find individual policy issues in common with every other political party in the Parliament, my party has a radically different set of priorities. That shows itself in the number of members who have asked whether the budget is fit for the current economic circumstances. No one yet has asked whether it is a budget that could have been written before the passage of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.</p><p>It is absurd to argue that we can achieve the radical transformation towards a low-carbon economy without changing the way in which we spend money in the public sector. It is sad that repeated budgets&#8212;not only under the current Administration but under the previous one as well&#8212;have locked in future emissions, particularly in the transport sector, without even serving social justice aspirations.</p><p>As we have faced that situation, my party has sought to make urgent changes in every Scottish budget. We have achieved some changes: we have abolished aviation subsidies, supported the climate challenge fund, which funds schemes throughout Scotland, and achieved a limited increase in the small amount of support for public transport.</p><p>Last year, we wanted to move on from there and consider the transformation of our housing stock. There is an urgent need for low-carbon solutions. That is not only a public good but an urgent need. A lot of work has been done on domestic energy issues with fuel poverty as the principal policy driver. That must not end, but it must be built on. As WWF showed in its recent research, which was circulated to members, and as it restated in its briefing today, a universal, non-means-tested approach to that work will secure the greatest public benefit through efficiencies of scale, a higher uptake level and an end to the everlasting target-and-miss approach. In means-tested targeting, we miss anything up to two thirds of those who are in fuel poverty. We must achieve rapid progress towards public policy goals and the <place-holder colnum=\"22903\"/> continued use of carbon emissions reductions target money from the energy companies. In short, the greatest public good can be achieved from the public money being spent.</p><p>WWF has also argued for a radical increase in scale, with which we agree. The Scottish Government's figures back up that analysis of the scale of the challenge. We could not reach agreement with the Scottish Government last year on the issues of scale and methodology. We need to see clear indications of progress on both those issues from the cabinet secretary.</p><p>On the other side of the energy equation is electricity generation. Every MSP is aware of Scotland's potential in the marine energy sector. The Scottish Government was eventually willing to take a controversial decision on the vital Beauly to Denny line, but we must do more than that; it should be about energy, not pylons. I have repeatedly made the case that the companies that could be pioneers and world leaders in marine renewable energy in the decades to come must be offered support by Government. Such support was given previously, and it must be restored.</p><p>A representative of Aquamarine Power Ltd has argued that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"WATES2 funding would enable developers ... to leverage millions of pounds of private sector investment and put full-scale commercial devices in the water within the next few years ... Without public sector support, that future is much less certain.\"</p><p>Palamis Wave Power Ltd has argued that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the current position which Scotland finds itself with regards to marine energy is one which can be lost to other nations who are also committed to securing the wider social and economic benefits of marine energy ... now is the time for Scotland to continue\"</p><p>supporting the sector.</p><p>I hope that the whole chamber will welcome the cabinet secretary's statements on progress towards restoring support for the industry. We will, of course, push him to go further. The wave and tidal energy scheme made more money available than he suggested earlier, and it was recommended that it be increased. However, the cabinet secretary's announcement is a huge improvement on yet another press release on the saltire prize.</p><p>In the years to come, our difficulty in reaching agreement with the SNP Government will get worse, if continued support is given to ridiculous and unnecessary spending on projects such as the additional Forth road bridge. There are other, longer-term issues as well. The lessons of minority government are not being learned. Coalition partnership agreements risked a lack of financial coherence; minority government compounds that risk. If we are not willing to reform the process, <place-holder colnum=\"22904\"/> future Governments may come to regret that. In her speech, Wendy Alexander made similarly important points about the long term. I suspect that John Swinney could have made the same speech if he had been in the Opposition seats facing a Labour minority Administration&#8212;one day he might be, so he would do well to listen to this argument.</p><p>Again, I welcome the statement on increased investment for the marine energy sector. On home insulation, however, the cabinet secretary must indicate that, on scale and universality, there is scope in this year's budget to move matters on substantially from where we were a year ago.</p>", "hdate": "2010-01-20", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20511867", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget (Scotland) (No 4) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I was going to say that, despite regular, repeated and early attempts at constructive engagement with Mr Swinney over the budgets, I was the only member in the chamber who has never yet voted to approve an SNP budget, but I have just been joined by the other such member.

I will be interested to hear what the minister says about that in his closing remarks.</p><p>Can we contemplate a future for Scotland if we allow the projected growth in aviation, which still seems to inform Government policy, to proceed, or do we need to do what the UK Committee on Climate Change has suggested or, indeed, go further and fly less instead of more? Any Government minister for climate change will be able to come to the chamber and read out a long list of the things that he is doing well&#8212;the actions that are busily being taken in every department in every office of the Scottish Government&#8212;but the other list of achievements, which are proudly announced when we debate the economy, is very different. That list includes infrastructure and economic policy decisions that will generate higher rather than lower levels of emissions. We never hear that list of achievements being read out in climate change debates. It is the policies that ministers never mention in climate change debates that we need to face up to, and we need to begin to do that now, rather than continually pat ourselves on the back for achieving consensus.</p><p>I am sorry that I will not have time to reply to every member who spoke in the debate, all of whom made important and serious points, but I will try to respond to what some members said. Sarah Boyack spoke optimistically&#8212;and reasonably so&#8212;about the chances of a constructive deal being agreed at Copenhagen, even if it cannot be made a legally binding treaty quite yet. She also stressed the UK Government's role in providing leadership and identified the Scottish Government's shortcomings on electric vehicles, community heating, household renewables and translating ambition into action, which has been my theme, too. Even on issues such as energy efficiency and cutting our energy demand, we do not have consensus. We agree on the fuel poverty objectives, but we have not yet found a way to <place-holder colnum=\"22156\"/> incorporate the climate change and energy security objectives, which we must work on consistently. We need to recognise that a three-pronged approach is necessary. Some of us favour a universal approach; others favour targeting. For many years, our targeting has failed.</p><p>Alex Johnstone expressed concern that he had not dragged his feet enough during consideration of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill but, seriously, I recognise his desire to represent the country's economic interests as he sees them, even if we disagree on the basic assumptions behind that. In this Parliament, we heard nothing of the irrational, anti-science rhetoric that we hear elsewhere. No MSP could fairly be labelled as the Melanie Phillips of Holyrood, and we can be extremely grateful for that.</p><p>The consensus on intent has been hard won, but we must not delude ourselves that consensus covers every detail of action. Alex Johnstone and I will not agree on the emphasis that he placed on the role of the free market, but I put to him an issue that the operation of the publicly owned banks raises. RBS is still investing substantial amounts of what is now our money in tar sands, which could be one of the most polluting fuels on the planet. Alex Johnstone might point out to me that if RBS were to pull out of that, another bank would step in to fill the hole in investment. That illustrates the fundamental problem with leaving our efforts on climate change in the hands of the free market.</p><p>Alison McInnes recognised that the issue of Scottish ministers having formal status in the UK delegation is less important than what is said, and I agree. We should move on from that debate and work together to ensure that we make Scotland's case for other developed countries to take more ambitious action.</p><p>Like Des McNulty, Alison McInnes also mentioned politicians' personal responsibilities when it comes to our travel choices. I do not want to make an issue of that right now, but in the future it will be for the Parliament, corporately, to take action on the development of a meaningful sustainable transport policy, because it will be a matter of shame if we cannot provide leadership in that area. There might be times when using a more sustainable form of transport will take more time out of our lives or cost more money, which might mean taking fewer people or going on visits less often, but we will have to do something on that front.</p><p>I have covered the banks issue that Rob Gibson raised, on which I wanted to reply, so I finish by replying to Pauline McNeill, who talked about making tackling climate change part of our lives. That means expressing priorities in ways that are relevant to real people. Phrases such as <place-holder colnum=\"22157\"/> \"alternatives to GDP\" sound a bit academic and pointy headed. Measuring and valuing the things that matter, such as human relationships, good health, time to spend with our families and happiness, are among the ideas that we need to communicate properly to people. If we do that, we can replace the shallow and selfish values of consumerism with something more humane, viable and liveable.

I do not disagree with a word of it, and I agree with and welcome much of what he said in his speech.</p><p>However, I lodged my amendment because there is an important question that we need to discuss face to face, which is about the meaning of consensus. What is the nature of the consensus, such as it is, that we have achieved? With the Parliament's unanimous passing of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, which, as Stewart Stevenson mentioned, received broad support from the private sector, community groups, churches, trade unions and tens of thousands of individuals in Scotland, we achieved consensus of intent&#8212;consensus on what the objectives are and where we want to get to by 2020 and 2050.</p><p>We have achieved consensus right across the political spectrum, without conspiracy theory, denial or anyone arguing the case against reductions in emissions. That has not been the case in every country, and we need to recognise the value of that consensus of intent. Whereas here the issue has not been politically controversial, in the US, Australia and some of our fellow European member states, there has not been consensus of intent. In some of those countries, it seems that the stronger the evidence on climate change becomes, the louder grow the complaints from those who will not accept the science or who, for reasons of right-wing ideology, fear that responding to climate change poses a threat to the dominance of the unfettered free market. They are right to fear that, because it is increasingly clear that the free market cannot give us the answers that we need on climate change.</p><p>It will be important to stress in Copenhagen that it is possible to achieve the consensus of intent that we have achieved. Not just today's Governments but all their successors for decades ahead need to sign up to the programme that comes out of Copenhagen, which will mean achieving consensus of intent across the political spectrum. I value the limited consensus that we have achieved.</p><p>Sadly, there is no consensus on action, and it is wrong to suggest that there is. The First Minister was wrong when he said during First Minister's questions that the Parliament was unified on climate change objectives and the delivery <place-holder colnum=\"22127\"/> programme. We have agreed the objectives, but we are divided on many of the actions that are required. The consensus that we have achieved is valuable but limited at best.</p><p>The First Minister's answer to my question about some of the actions that we need to take on aviation was disappointing. At present, it is projected that UK aviation levels will grow by some 200 per cent by 2050 if we do not impose some form of control. At that rate of growth, it will become at first extremely challenging and then physically impossible to reach the target of cutting our emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. Even the UK Committee on Climate Change's recommendation that aviation growth be limited to 60 per cent will require tougher targets for the rest of the economy at a time when every Government department seems, understandably, to be daunted by the challenge that has already been set.</p><p>When the First Minister is challenged on the impossibility of matching existing aviation policy with existing climate change policy, all that he can say is that aviation emissions are included in the targets. I know that we are going to count the emissions, but we need to count them as they go down, not watch and count them as they go up. We need to restrain aviation growth if even the UK Committee on Climate Change's recommendations are to be met. No consensus exists on the actions that require to be taken in that area.</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20449504", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sure that the Parliament will, as the minister has called on us to do, endorse the motion that he has moved.

More plus more still equals more.</p><p>There is no consensus on the priority that climate change deserves. I have lost count of the number of times that ministers, including the First Minister, have stated that climate change is one of the most urgent issues of our age, and of the number of times when ministers, including the First Minister&#8212;he generally does so with more pride than most&#8212;have answered criticisms of their construction record by puffing themselves up and talking about the road building programme rather than their record on constructing low-carbon <place-holder colnum=\"22128\"/> homes, retroffiting existing homes or building public transport schemes, which the current Administration has developed a habit of cancelling. Only last week in the chamber, John Swinney sang the praises of the M74 extension in Glasgow. Whenever the false choice between the economy and the environment is posed, the short-term dash for growth wins out. We have no consensus yet on the priority that is attached to climate change; if we had that, we would all understand that the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, and that it must operate within limits.</p><p>Transport is an interesting issue. Unlike other areas for which there are portfolios, transport is not a good in itself. We all agree, for example, that we want a country with good health, and that education is more than a means to an economic end but enriches life in itself. Transport is different. Although 20<sup>th</sup> century economists may have worked under the absolute assumption that ever-increasing mobility is always desirable for human freedom or for the economy, 21<sup>st</sup> century economists must come to recognise that aiming to satisfy an ever-growing demand for transport will hugely damage our quality of life and environment, and that, for energy reasons, that will ultimately be impossible.</p><p>We need to ask ourselves what the role of mobility is. What is it for? After years of hearing Government ministers saying how seriously they take climate change, why are we still not counting the carbon impact of infrastructure decisions? Why are we not using the planning system to localise public services, economic activity and food production, to name just a few things, so that we can reduce the demand for transport?</p><p>Energy generation is perhaps the clearest area in which consensus breaks down. I am sure that members will talk about nuclear power in the debate. Nuclear power is no longer simply a question of waste and where to put it; it is also a question of where to get the fuel from. The world has a limited supply of uranium, just as it has limited supplies of all the other mineral commodities. For fuel reasons, aside from the issue of waste, Scotland is not the kind of country that should pursue the nuclear route. I do not want to swap peak oil for peak uranium.</p><p>Other people argue for carbon capture and storage. Perhaps carbon capture and storage technology is being developed, but it does not yet exist. It might work one day, but the UK and Scottish Governments seem to think that it is a dead cert. On that basis, they have opened the door to new coal-fired power stations. I draw members' attention to the briefing that we have received from RSPB Scotland about the proposal for a new unabated coal-fired power station at <place-holder colnum=\"22129\"/> Hunterston. The use of unabated coal must end&#8212;we must be unequivocal about that.</p><p>Even on renewable energy, although everyone is signed up to it on paper, too many politicians are happy to indulge misguided local opposition to development instead of challenging the assumptions that underlie that opposition. The Scottish Environment LINK report on the sustainable land use strategy says that our landscapes are important to us because they</p><p class=\"indent\">\"contain the record of the achievements and failures of those people who went before us\".</p><p>Our landscapes must contain the record of the achievements of the renewables industry or they will be doomed to contain the record of our failure on climate change.</p><p>There are areas in which there is no consensus on action. We must address the values that underpin our society&#8212;not just questions of what mobility is for, but questions of what consumerism and economic growth are for. Those are the fundamental questions that must be addressed before we can have consensus on action. As political leaders, all members of the Parliament have a responsibility to show the way. We do not yet have a consensus among ourselves about the actions that must be undertaken in our own lifestyles.</p><p>I am not happy to break the consensus, but I feel that it is important to move the amendment in my name. I move amendment S3M-5379.1, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\", and further agrees that the targets set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 leave no room for complacency and that the Scottish targets can only be achieved with a fundamental policy shift in areas such as road building, energy generation and use and aviation expansion.\"</p>", "hdate": "2009-12-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20449504", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I agree that that is possible, but I do not agree that it is guaranteed.

If the number of journeys goes up, we will have a double whammy, with increased emissions from surface journeys and from the larger number of flights. At some point, we will have to get beyond that contradiction.</p><p>When the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill was presented, I argued consistently that crossrail was the top priority. It should always have been the top priority, as it would have the maximum benefit for the maximum number of rail users in Glasgow and the wider region. It still should be the priority. I voted for the GARL bill simply because it would have been irrational to vote against it on the basis that projects were being pursued in the wrong order.</p><p>Although my support for the GARL project was lukewarm, my support for cancellation would be bizarre when set against the substantial and continually growing road-building project that the Government and its predecessor Administration have pursued. There are projects on the books that I would not build even if they were free to build and those should have been the targets for cancellation. Sadly, it is too late to cancel some of them, but there are other road projects that could be targets if savings are needed.</p><p>Some of the arguments on the project have been rehearsed at the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee and will continue to be debated as we draft a report for the Finance <place-holder colnum=\"20854\"/> Committee. There are issues on the timing of the decision and its announcement and on the process, which, in effect, prohibited rational discussion of alternative approaches by stakeholders. There are also issues on the presentation. The Government could have floated a proposal or recommendation from Government, with a willingness to discuss alternatives. However, we were merely presented with a decision. There is also the dispute about the figures and the management of costs. No doubt, the committee will address all those issues in our report.</p><p>Before I finish, I will address a longer-term issue, which is that, although we all expect that there will be funding constraints in future, the far greater constraint arises as a result of Government priorities, because of the idea that a single vast project with a vast price tag&#8212;the additional Forth road bridge&#8212;should be the top and only priority. GARL will not be the last project to suffer because of that perverse priority.

With its business partners, it carefully constructed a house of cards.</p><p>The Labour amendment focuses on GARL. It is known that I am a lukewarm supporter of the project. If we were willing to limit the growth of aviation and use the rail link to improve the <place-holder colnum=\"20737\"/> experience of using the airport and displace more polluting forms of surface transport, that would be all well and good, but I am sad to say that I do not think that the Labour Party would support those limits on aviation growth any more than the SNP would do. We might need to rely on rising oil prices to bring the number of flights down to a sustainable level. Labour's position seems to confirm that the UK party still has a business-as-usual mentality, just as Scottish Labour does&#8212;as if I did not already know that.</p><p>Although I might have expected a more broad-ranging amendment from a party that should be jumping up and down with excitement at the prospect of coming to power in a few months, Derek Brownlee made at least one important point about accelerated capital spending. If such spending becomes a regular tussle between the UK and Scottish Governments, and if any settlement comes with strings attached, it will indeed be a form of ring fencing, although I am a wee bit surprised that we have not seen such ring fencing already. If Mr Brownlee's comments can be taken as a commitment that such strings will never be attached if his party comes to power in the UK, they are worth hearing.</p><p>Understandably, much of the debate has focused on the short term and the immediate impact on our constituents today, whether in relation to the economy or the impact of cuts on public spending. Those cuts will hit hardest those who are already in poverty and who have suffered most during the recession. We should ensure that we have a longer-term focus as well. It is not as if there are no other options to protect public spending, or at least to ensure greater equity in the face of cuts.</p><p>At the UK level, there has been no consideration of ending the tax loophole that allows major banks to offset their previous losses against future taxation as they return to profitability, ensuring that some of them will not pay tax at all for many years to come, despite Adair Turner warming to the idea of options like a Tobin tax to curb the efforts of the mega-rich to line their pockets further through speculation.</p><p>Why has there been no crackdown on those who evade and avoid tax, or on the obscene salaries and bonuses in the banking sector? The usual answer that we get to that question is that we must retain the talent. Those clever, clever people who are so talented at shafting the rest of us must be rewarded, otherwise they might leave the country and start shafting someone else instead. I say, let them go. Just as our political landscape needs to face up to fundamental economic change, many parts of our private sector could do with a purge of the casino capitalists <place-holder colnum=\"20738\"/> instead of yet another attempt to flatter them and indulge their whims.</p><p>I say to the Labour members, and to their Westminster colleagues, the Tories will not do those things; this is Labour's last chance. Of course Labour members will not do it, any more than they will take our nationalised banks' money out of the arms trade or tar sands. They will not do those things because they have spent so long pretending to have abandoned any radical left-wing agenda that it has become the truth.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis made an important contribution on breaking up the banks. I want to add to that the argument about changing the banks' culture. It is important that we change their structure, and I was disappointed to hear the cabinet secretary respond by welcoming the merger of another bank.

We have challenged the complacency about an economy that has been built on flimsy foundations. We have done so as debt has spiralled out of control, largely to fuel wasteful consumption by the wealthy, not to provide the essentials of life for those who lacked them.</p><p>When I spoke about the problems of sub-prime debt before the 2007 election, I did not do so because I had a crystal ball or insight into the future credit crunch; I was more concerned with the impact on households in Scotland burdened with exploitative levels of debt than with the United States housing market. I did so because of a basic principle that such levels of debt are inherently unhealthy. I am not talking about only financial debt, whether it is owed by a householder to a money lender, a credit card company or a mortgage company, or owed by Governments to an international bank or a private finance initiative consortium; I am also talking about the ecological debt that our generation owes to the next generation. There can be no doubt that we have been living beyond our means economically and ecologically for far too long, and that there were always going to be consequences of that. Living beyond our means can be fun for a while, but it cannot last.</p><p>The consequences that we are now living with are partly the result of political failure and partly the result of market failure. It is sickening that the debate has moved on so swiftly to arguments about which public services should be cut first and when to start cutting. Sadly, we in Scotland are faced with the consequences of continuing political and market failure.</p><p>A very gloomy economic and social outlook was presented at the Poverty Alliance annual general meeting in Glasgow the other weekend. There is the prospect of cuts that will have an impact on people living in poverty, and the need to fight the immediate threat from those cuts versus the need to keep up the long-term challenge to the values of our unequal and unfair society is an issue. The evidence has never been clearer or more objective. A more equal society is happier, healthier, safer and more sustainable. I am sorry to say that the political emphasis has not caught up with that, and that costs opportunities.</p><p>For a recovery&#8212;however we might define that word&#8212;to be truly sustainable, it must be political as well as economic. It must be a recovery of <place-holder colnum=\"20718\"/> values that were lost from the political establishment at least 30 years ago&#8212;indeed, probably twice that long ago.

Commitments are made on public transport, but road traffic levels continue to rise. Commitments are made on renewables, but the level of wasted energy continues to rise.

The Beauly to Denny transmission line is only the most obvious example of that. We will need further changes to accommodate marine renewables as well as decentralised energy.

We should recognise <place-holder colnum=\"19819\"/> Frank McAveety for bringing the debate to the chamber, the many organisations to which members have referred that have campaigned on the issue, and the track record of the UK Government in introducing the minimum wage in the first place. Regardless of who was there to vote for it, we can all now agree that it was an important, necessary step and that none of us would wish to go back to the levels of exploitation that existed before the measure was introduced.</p><p>However, the minimum wage is clearly not enough. We still have significant levels of low pay and poverty among working people, and we need to look at what we can do to reduce those. Members need take only the briefest of glances at the papers that have been circulated by the organisations that are campaigning on the issue. A couple with two children paid at the minimum wage would need to work 58 hours a week to lift them out of poverty. How much time would be left for the couple to spend with those two children? Twenty per cent of directly employed staff in the public sector earn less than the &#163;7 an hour living wage. Although that is a lower proportion than in sectors such as the retail and hospitality and catering sectors, the gender gap&#8212;the difference between the proportion of men and women who earn less than the &#163;7 an hour living wage&#8212;is starker in the public sector than anywhere else. We have a responsibility to take steps to address the issue, looking at its impact on women workers, young workers and casual workers, and to try to eradicate poverty among working people. I congratulate the living wage campaign on taking forward this progressive agenda and on its emphasis on public sector leadership.</p><p>The other side of the entirely non-party-political point that I was going to make is that, over the decades, we have seen inequality between rich and poor continue to increase, as Bill Wilson pointed out. Despite successfully pushing, as they rightly did, for the minimum wage, successive UK and Scottish Governments have simultaneously f&#234;ted the super-rich. Who can forget the words of Lord Mandelson, who described himself as intensely comfortable with the idea of people becoming very rich? I am not intensely comfortable with that idea, at a time when the evidence is overwhelming&#8212;it has never been stronger&#8212;that a more equal society is a healthier, a happier, a safer and even a more sustainable society.</p><p>Malcolm Chisholm rightly said that the levels of ordinary people's wages supposedly becoming too high is not part of what has led to the recession.</p><p>There is not only a moral responsibility in relation to high pay but a demand for political leadership for a more equal society. We need to consider both aspects&#8212;the low wages and the <place-holder colnum=\"19820\"/> high wages&#8212;if we want that more equal society. We absolutely want public leadership on a living wage. That public leadership should say that we do not think that the situation is acceptable in the public sector, and we are going to advocate for progress in the private sector, too.</p><p>Let us all use the budget debates that have started as of this afternoon to press the Scottish Government to adopt that position, and not wait for the UK Government. Whether my good friends in the Labour Party would wish to admit it or not, the chances are that it will be a Tory UK Government in not a very long time, and such a Government will not take that step. We are therefore right to push the Scottish Government to act.</p><p>What comes after that? We must not rest on our laurels even after we have a living wage. There are ideas such as the one that John Wilson discussed, about the citizen's income, which would sweep away tax and benefits complexity, or that of a maximum wage ratio between what the highest and lowest-paid people in a single organisation may be paid. Pushing for ideas like that to be adopted would leave the next generation of Scots with a fundamentally equal society, and they would have cause to thank us for that.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20194187", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Living Wage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I suppose that it was a bit much to expect complete freedom from party-political point scoring even in a members' business debate.

Obviously, the truth must be one of those two extremes&#8212;there is no chance that it could be somewhere in between.</p><p>Margo MacDonald's speech was the clearest exception in a debate of polar opposites. Her demolition jobs are always carried out in such a kind tone of voice, and I appreciated her contribution.</p><p>The economic situation has dominated a number of speeches. Iain Gray endorsed the CBI's suggestion of a single benchmark for every measure that is introduced by the Government. I raised my eyebrow at that because it is usually the Green party that is accused of being a single-issue party. Even if we accept that the economic situation is a crucial challenge that we face, the idea of having a single benchmark of economic growth to test each policy against is absurd. How about a more holistic approach to the question whether our policies are good for the economic situation? How about measuring equity in the economy? What could Scotland do with maximum wage ratios or other proposals that could come from a high pay commission? I would like to hear what Labour members and others&#8212;including some on the SNP back benches&#8212;would say about that. I can guarantee that such a proposal would not get the CBI's support, but it might get a great deal of support from many care workers, cleaners, young workers, casual workers and temporary workers. Perhaps we should think about taking a more holistic approach to determining whether our policies are good for the economy.<place-holder colnum=\"19301\"/></p><p>The Government's programme is, like most Government programmes, a mixture of some sensible moves, which should gain majority support, a little bit of posturing, and&#8212;from a green perspective&#8212;not much in the way of change.</p><p>I will run through a few policies. Some members opposed to independence and to a referendum have accused the Government of creating a distraction or wasting parliamentary time. If their parties are determined to scupper a referendum bill, it will take up only as much parliamentary time as the committees choose to devote to it. If those other parties choose to reject the bill, it will die at the first hurdle. Personally, I would like there to be a referendum, and I would vote yes in it, but beyond that political dividing line, the parties that have other visions and suggestions for how devolution should progress and for how the powers of the Parliament should change will, at some point, have to answer the question: when should those be put to the people as a single issue in a referendum? That was how the Parliament was established, and that is how the Parliament should be allowed to develop.</p><p>On the proposed alcohol measures, the argument for minimum pricing has gained broad support, albeit with the exception of the Conservatives. The Greens will certainly be willing to support it if the detail is right and if the policy is introduced alongside other measures. I am glad that the Government has stepped back from its earlier proposals on 18 to 21-year-olds and off-licences. Just localising the decision is not enough, however. We should not end up with a patchwork, with 18 to 21-year-olds demonised in some parts of Scotland but not in others. If there is evidence that 18 to 21-year-olds are causing a social problem that people in other age groups are not, we can perhaps allow the power to be used as a temporary measure. However, the measure must be justified by the evidence and used alongside other measures that will resolve the problem&#8212;we cannot suppose that a ban on 18 to 21-year-olds in off-licences for a period will in itself solve anything.</p><p>Alex Neil, who is sitting on the front bench, will be working on the proposed housing measures, and I welcome many of the measures that are being discussed. In particular, I welcome the restrictions on the right to buy, which, as he knows, I have long supported. At the beginning of his statement this morning, the First Minister placed much emphasis on people getting on to the housing ladder&#8212;as if none of us has recognised over the past year or two the effects of the obsession with property ownership and the housing ladder at the exclusion of all else, with the implication that social or rented housing is an option of last resort. I welcome some of the <place-holder colnum=\"19302\"/> measures that are to be included in the proposed housing bill.</p><p>What of the private rented sector? The issues that are mentioned in the programme document are limited to possible changes to landlord registration and regulations on houses in multiple occupation. Some changes to make those systems work better might be worth while, but I urge the Government to go further and consider the issue of management standards. Enforceable management standards for the private rented sector would be welcomed by the best landlords, and they would certainly be welcomed by the tenants who have been so poorly served by a minority of landlords. I urge the Government to consider that proposal.</p><p>On climate change, the image inside the front page of the \"Greener Scotland\" section of the programme says it all. Far too often, the Scottish Government, like other Governments, thinks that the climate change agenda can be addressed by telling people about some small measure, such as changing their light bulbs or turning their taps off when they brush their teeth, without recognising that what is required is more structural. Of course, there is a great big elephant in the room&#8212;a giant, multimillion-pound white elephant, ready to be built across the Forth.</p><p>The Government is doing some of the right things, just as the previous Government did some of the right things. I welcome the climate challenge fund, but it amounts to the value of only about a quarter of a mile of the M74 extension. It is not enough to do the right thing while at the same time continuing to do the wrong thing. What is required is radical, transformational change in our economy, our society and our politics. History demonstrates that such progressive change rarely happens because Governments offer it; it happens because people demand it. I urge the thousands of people who campaigned for a strong Climate Change (Scotland) Bill not to stop campaigning and to continue to demand progressive change.</p>", "hdate": "2009-09-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20174155", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Government's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "After a strange, unusual couple of weeks at the end of the parliamentary recess, it seems that we are largely back to normal, with lots of glowing speeches from SNP members about the optimism, the good-news stories and the ambition to create a better, brighter, shinier, lovelier Scotland, and lots of scathing speeches from other parties, using terms such as \"missed opportunities\",...", "collapsed": 0, "speaker": {"first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "Harvie", "title": "", "url": "/msp/?m=80325", "house": "4", "member_id": "80325", "person_id": "14006", "party": "Green", "constituency": "Glasgow"}, "section_id": "20174155", "hpos": "342", "gid": "2009-09-03.19300.0", "epobject_id": "20174196", "htype": "12", "relevance": 100, "listurl": "/sp/?id=2009-09-03.19281.0&amp;s=speaker%3A14006+section%3Asp#g19300.0", "minor": "0", "htime": "15:48:00", "speaker_id": "80325"}, {"body": "<p>The arguments with regard to mandatory minimum sentences for knife crime are familiar and, indeed, were exercised in the previous parliamentary session.

I thank my fellow members of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee as well as other members from outwith the committee who have engaged constructively throughout the process. I thank our witnesses and our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament information centre. In particular, I thank our team of clerks, who have, perhaps more than any of us, earned a fabulous summer recess after the work that they have put in.</p><p>I also thank the NGO community, especially the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition&#8212;which was misreported today as the \"Save Climate Change Coalition\" by a newspaper sub-editor who does not seem to get it&#8212;for the wider pressure that has been applied. That pressure has come not just from campaign groups and activists but from people in the private sector&#8212;for example, Scottish and Southern Energy's chief executive, Ian Marchant&#8212;and from others in faith organisations. Without that overwhelming pressure from outside Parliament, we would not have made the progress that has been made during the bill's passage over the past few months.</p><p>Alex Johnstone spoke of those who might have grave doubts about the nature of climate change, but another criticism that might be made, which I do not direct at any particular party, is that many people out there might have even graver doubts about the nature of party politics. Despite the progress that has been made with the bill, the victory belongs to the outside campaigners. Perhaps the degree of posturing that has taken place&#8212;on all sides&#8212;is understandable and is a natural shortcoming of party politics, but we should <place-holder colnum=\"18801\"/> think carefully about how, and whether, we might avoid that in future.</p><p>Despite those shortcomings, Scotland has shown itself, in passing the bill, to be not just environmentalist but rationalist and internationalist. We have recognised our responsibility for the unequal impact of the choices that we make not only on people here at home&#8212;as Cathy Peattie argued, we need a just transition&#8212;but also on people around the world. Des McNulty was right to remind us that we could, and should, have done better in that regard.</p><p>Sarah Boyack asked where we go from here. Again, my message is primarily to the campaigners and activists. Their work will continue to be vital if we are to turn the commitments that we have made into a reality. As I said to Des McNulty earlier, the headline target in the bill&#8212;the 42 per cent interim target&#8212;is a vote delayed rather than a vote that we have taken today. Some of the language used in the climate change delivery plan, in ministerial correspondence in recent days and in speeches today makes me fear that we will end up debating which powers are reserved and which are devolved, and arguing that we need reserved powers in order to reach the 42 per cent target. That is an argument that I do not intend to try to settle in this debate, but it will be settled in Parliament. To every one of the tens of thousands of people in Scotland who have lobbied us, who have argued with us and who have pressured us to do better, I say, \"Keep going,\" because if party politics shows itself to be wanting, we will have achieved very little by passing the bill.</p><p>Targets alone are not enough. They are necessary, but not sufficient. They will not be achieved without a radical shift in policy on transport, housing, land use, food and energy. An energy issue that has not come up in today's debate is infrastructure. Pretty much every member who gets it on climate change recognises the need, for example, for upgrades to the grid, such as the controversial Beauly to Denny transmission line. Yet where is the leadership when people raise aesthetic objections? It is clear that the renewables demanded by the delivery plan will not be connected to the grid without that kind of upgrade. As we await the result of the public local inquiry on the Beauly to Denny line, all of us who argue for radical targets in the bill should be showing leadership on that issue.</p><p>We do not yet know the detail of all of the policy shifts that will be required over the next 40 years. It is as though people in the late 1960s drafted a bill setting targets for delivery today. They could not have anticipated the social, technological and economic changes that have taken place, and nor can we anticipate all the changes that will take <place-holder colnum=\"18802\"/> place, although we know that they will be more radical than any Government can imagine.</p><p>If party politics is found wanting at any stage in the coming decades, it is possible that only more radical approaches, such as those being prepared by people who are getting ready to take direct action on some of the most polluting activities&#8212;coal extraction, new coal-fired power stations and new road building&#8212;will prompt future politicians to take the radical steps that will be necessary to turn the targets in the bill from numbers on a page into reality.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "19977578", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "What can I say to Cathy Peattie, other than \"Congratulations\"?

As I have recognised from the start, the concept is complex and innovative and we simply cannot take something off the shelf, set it up and get it running straightaway.

We also welcomed the assurance that aviation and shipping emissions would be included not only at some point in the system that we are putting in place, but at the outset.</p><p>However, as it stands, the drafting of the bill says that ministers \"may ... make provision\" to include aviation and shipping emissions. My <place-holder colnum=\"18720\"/> amendment 109 seeks to change the word \"may\" to \"must\".

It is clear that, although this is a developing area of science&#8212;just as the whole subject of climate change is&#8212;emissions at altitude have a disproportionate and substantial impact on the causes of climate change. It has been argued that a multiplier should therefore be applied before aviation emissions are counted for the purpose of the target.</p><p>Towards the end of amendment 109, I seek to require that the provision</p><p class=\"indent\">\"must include the use, for each greenhouse gas, of a multiplier which reflects the direct and indirect non-carbon dioxide climate change impacts of emissions at altitude from international aviation\"</p><p>on climate change.</p><p>Amendment 112 raises the issue of a multiplier in respect of the advice that ministers must request from the advisory body&#8212;at present the UK Committee on Climate Change. That committee has expressed its view and the UK Government also has a view. Given that those views will develop over time, it is important that ministers are required to seek advice on the most appropriate multiplier that should apply.</p><p>At times, aviation can come in for a bit too much stick. I recognise that it is only one element of a much broader agenda. We need to reduce our dependence on aviation, just as we need to reduce our road traffic levels, energy demands and waste. In that context, aviation emissions should not be exempt on the basis that they represent only a small proportion of overall emissions. If aviation emissions are to be included in the bill, we should include all of their impact.

That implies a recognition that the end point is not enough, and that we need to think about how many greenhouse gases we emit in the period between now and any target dates; about the relationship between annual targets and long-term targets; and about the points at which those long-term targets should be set.</p><p>It is now clear that although we have broad agreement on the principles, we are basing our work on science that is already out of date.

The debate was shortish but, of all members in the chamber, perhaps Robin Harper would most agree with me that, as the bill has been seven years in the making since his first proposal, it is not a problem for the final stage to be concluded as rapidly as possible.</p><p>Bill Butler and Robert Brown mentioned some of the historical steps that have been taken, including the proposals from Donald Gorrie and those from my colleague Robin Harper. Robert Brown argued that we are building on previous work, and I am happy to endorse his comments. Indeed, the measure was the key recommendation of the working group that was established as a result of the early proposals, which reported five years ago.</p><p>Robert Brown also mentioned the changing attitudes to equality and the progress that has been made in society. I agree with what he said about that as well, but I point out that it did not happen by magic or because people wished for it. It happened because many people way outside the political bubble worked hard and took risks for it, and also experienced risks in their lives. That is what makes progress happen&#8212;people working for it, not wishing for it.</p><p>David Whitton also gave a bit of an historical perspective from his point of view. He says that he bears the scars of the section 28 debate. I might once have felt that I bore one or two of those as well myself, but I felt that we won that argument in the end not only in the Parliament but outside it because the repeal was the right thing. Sometimes&#8212;at least for my community&#8212;what does not kill you makes you stronger. Here we stand.</p><p>Some technical issues have been raised on the bill. Paul Martin talked about mandatory sentences. I had hoped that he would&#8212;and still hope that he will&#8212;accept that they are not the <place-holder colnum=\"18125\"/> right mechanism for the bill, which will cover offences ranging from low-level vandalism or threatening behaviour right up to extremely serious assaults and murder. It may be wrong to attach mandatory sentences to such a broad range of offences.</p><p>Several members mentioned the flexibility of the common law. We are clear that the common law has flexibility but that that flexibility is not currently exercised sufficiently to address the problem.</p><p>Nigel Don mentioned the scope of the bill. I accept that we are not proposing a new mechanism. The mechanism already exists, but its present scope is narrow, as it covers only race and religion. There has been an argument about whether the bill should extend to prejudice on age and gender, but both committees recognised that the people who work in the fields of age and gender and who support those who experience, as well as other offences, the domestic violence that Nigel Don outlined do not feel that an aggravation is the right mechanism for those offences. That is not to say that the issue should not be addressed. Many actions are required from government at all levels to do that, but introducing an aggravation is perhaps not the right one.</p><p>I will draw out an issue that was raised by a number of members who focused on disability in their speeches. I do not have time to mention everybody, but Bill Kidd, Kenny MacAskill, Richard Baker, Angela Constance and others mentioned it. We need to recognise the reality of disablism as Bill Kidd defined it, but it is also important not to confuse hate crime on grounds of prejudice against disabled people with vulnerability. They are separate issues. Many disabled people are additionally vulnerable to particular offences, but that is a different phenomenon from hate crime, which specifically concerns the motivation of a crime by prejudice. Vulnerability is a different issue; the bill is intended to address hate crime. When we make arguments on vulnerability, we must be careful not to imply that disabled people should accept being, or expect to be, vulnerable to such offences.</p><p>Michael McMahon expressed concern that existing powers are not being sufficiently used. I agree with much of what he said, but how much clearer does that make it that we cannot rely on the common law and that the aggravation is right? However, he is correct that a much wider range of measures is needed to overcome prejudice, including challenging the perception of some of moral disorder in relation to sexual orientation. What an angry response there would be if disabled people were accused of being in some way morally inferior in the way that people are in relation to their sexual orientation in some situations. I endorse Bill Wilson's vision of our <place-holder colnum=\"18126\"/> society accepting all of us on our own terms. All members, I think, want to work towards that.</p><p>Before I sit down, it would be wrong of me not to mention Bill Aitken's suggestion that, during the process, I made something of a nuisance of myself. I have mulled over a few possible responses to that comment. All I will say is that the celebration of the passage of the bill will be happening shortly in the Regent Bar. Members are welcome to come and hear my many responses to Bill Aitken's suggestion, some of which I will rehearse repeatedly during the evening.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15023911", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all members who contributed to the debate at stage 3 of the bill.

I am glad and grateful that we have got to this stage with cross-party consensus. The bill is a small but nonetheless necessary step.</p><p>I am also extraordinarily grateful that we have got to stage 3 on such a quiet news day in politics to maximise the coverage of the bill, which addresses an important issue. Unlike the shenanigans in politics that captivate and engage most of us who are involved in the political bubble, hate crimes reach down into every community and affect real lives daily in a deeply harmful way. Although the bill is one small step in the right direction, we should be glad that we can take it.</p><p>I thank the many people who have enabled us to reach this stage. Obviously, I thank the Government for helping me to produce the bill and for supporting it all the way along. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice and his colleagues in the Government helped to put the work together and bring us to where we are. Members in other political parties supported the bill at the proposal stage and at stage 1, and I hope that they will do so again at stage 3. Many other people have been involved, including the Justice Committee and its clerks and those who gave evidence to the committee.</p><p>Also, many organisations took part in the expert working group on hate crime, which the previous Administration initiated and which will reach its conclusion in legislation that will enact the group's key recommendations. Those organisations, and many individuals who have experienced various forms of hate crime over the years, have been willing to speak out in the Parliament and the media. People do not always feel safe or supported when they do that, but their doing so has enhanced the scrutiny and understanding of the issue in Parliament. I thank everyone who has helped the bill to reach this stage.<place-holder colnum=\"18099\"/></p><p>When I was growing up in Dumbarton, it was pretty much accepted that homophobic language was just playground banter and par for the course. It was unexpected even to challenge it, and to do so was to take a risk with personal safety. That was in what was supposed to be the protective and safe environment of a school. The situation has changed to an extent, but the issue has not gone away in schools or in the rest of society. The kind of behaviour that might wrongly be dismissed as mere playground banter can, in fact, involve deeply harmful criminal offences and bullying. Many people experience such behaviour and the harm that comes with it throughout their lives.</p><p>Later in my life, as a youth worker with a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth group, I became aware of the wide range of experiences of the young people with whom I worked. Some of them had a safe, supported and inclusive experience, not just in their education but in their wider life as they went into the workplace and in their communities. Others could not have had a more difficult and distressing experience. Some young people still have such experiences.</p><p>As well as prejudice in relation to the LGBT community, the bill covers prejudice in relation to disability. I have less personal experience of such prejudice, although I have been a worker for an HIV agency. HIV status is covered by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and therefore is also covered by the bill. Many people who experience crimes that are motivated by prejudice or hatred with regard to HIV status are marked for life.</p><p>The bill will not wave the problem away, resolve it overnight or solve every aspect of it. However, it is a necessary part of the overall picture and it is consistent with other Government action to address hate crime. The benefit from the bill will not simply be that we pass the appropriate sentences. I repeat that they will be appropriate sentences. The bill is not, as some would have it, only about tougher sentences; it is about getting the right sentence. For many lower-level offences, we are talking about non-custodial sentences, which we want to be carried out in the right setting and in a way that challenges the motivation that caused the crime in the first place and the prejudice that underlies the offence. For higher-tariff offences, the additional threat that is posed to society might warrant a longer custodial sentence, but being tough is not the objective&#8212;the objective is to be appropriate. We want to challenge behaviour and prevent the crimes from reoccurring.</p><p>As well as introducing more appropriate sentences, the bill will develop the data. At present, members can ask parliamentary questions of ministers about the number of offences that are aggravated by prejudice on the <place-holder colnum=\"18100\"/> grounds of race or religion, but we cannot consider a robust and reliable data set about the additional kinds of hate crime. We will be able to do that in future with the enactment of the bill and as courts put it into practice. We will have that information, which will help to inform efforts to prevent hate crimes from happening in the first place.</p><p>The bill will send a clear signal. I am never one for saying that sending a signal should be the primary motivation of legislation, but in this case that can be done as well as achieving the primary objectives of the legislation. We will be saying clearly that hate crime on the ground of prejudice in relation to sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability is as unacceptable in society as racist crime or crime motivated by prejudice on religious grounds. This Parliament should be proud that it is going to unite&#8212;I hope&#8212;in sending that clear message this evening.</p><p>I recognise that the bill is not a silver bullet; it is one part of a programme of action, many aspects of which are being developed by Government in relation to the forms of equality in the bill.</p><p>I have great pleasure in ensuring that this small but necessary step is taken by moving, That the Parliament agrees that the Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>", "hdate": "2009-06-03", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "15023911", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In the stage 1 debate, I remarked that the bill was small but perfectly formed, and so was its proposer.

There was a time when we were told that, only by getting rid of her lot would we see an end to that practice. Sadly, the UK Government has not begun to think again during its term in office. Throughout my childhood, energy utilities were privatised, but fuel poverty continues to rise.

In particular, the profitable parts of a service are often cherry picked and the parts with smaller margins or less convenient operations are scrapped. I fear that that would happen with the Royal Mail, however vital its services are to communities, including the rural and remote island communities that Liam McArthur mentioned.</p><p>I was struck by something that Lord Mandelson said in March, which gives me a little optimism and hope. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the shrill nature of some of the current debate is making it harder to make this case to potential partners.\"&#8212;[<em>Official Report, House of Lords</em>, 10 March 2009; Vol 708, c 1066.]</p><p>I urge members who oppose the proposals, and the people in communities and campaign groups who value the Royal Mail as a public service, to get shrill. Let us be more shrill and more assertive in our criticisms.<place-holder colnum=\"17326\"/></p><p>By our shrillness, we may even convince those companies that would snap up the Royal Mail, and recast its functions in terms of profitability, that it would be a deeply unwelcome and unpopular move. TNT has confirmed that it would like to buy about a third of Royal Mail. As David Whitton said, TNT has many clients in the private sector as well as in the public sector. As an MSP, I am forever seeing items delivered to my office in TNT bags, with the company's logos all over them. I therefore urge everyone who supports keeping the Royal Mail as a public service in the public sector to boycott TNT and to argue that other organisations&#8212;particularly organisations in the public sector&#8212;should not be using TNT's services. That would send a specific message to the company that it is welcome to take part in the private sector in delivering private services, but it should keep its hands off the Royal Mail.</p><p>If members have been reading the press recently, they will know that I have developed a bit of a Twitter habit, although I am not the only member in the chamber to have done that. However, I have gone one further, and have set up a Facebook group to campaign for a boycott of TNT. I want to encourage people&#8212;whether they are small, independent businesses, or whether they run procurement operations for large parts of the public sector&#8212;to take a stance against TNT that sends a clear message to TNT and to the UK Government that what is happening is not welcome.</p><p>As Jamie Hepburn's motion states, more than 170 MPs have signed the early day motion. There is also a petition on number 10's website that has more than 10,000 signatures. If I can get anywhere near that number on the Facebook group, we have a very good chance of scrapping this proposal, whichever Parliament we sit in.</p>", "hdate": "2009-05-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14967416", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Royal Mail (Part-privatisation)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There was once a legend that members' business debates were consensual.

Its ambition is to be carbon neutral in 10 years. If any country in the world could be forgiven for saying that climate change is someone else's fault and someone else's responsibility to deal with, it would be the Maldives, the capital city of which is hunched behind a tiny, vulnerable sea wall. Plans are already being made for evacuation, because the people know that they are going to lose their islands. That is leadership. What is the point of waiting until the world or Europe catches up? What is the point of assuming that the world will fail to catch up? The call for early action that was made by so many witnesses, endorsed by the science and recommended by the committee appears so far not to be heard.</p><p>As the bill stands, the first annual target will not be specified until the final year of the current Government's term of office and not at the 3 per cent trajectory that is needed. The committee has argued for earlier specified annual targets. I think that that is the basis of the slight misunderstanding between the Government and Labour Party front benchers on the amendment. The issue of contention is whether the earlier targets are to be specified in the bill as opposed to specified by ministers after the bill has passed.</p><p>Future Governments will inherit the targets, but we should not give the Administrations that will be elected in 2011, 2015 and 2019 cause to resent a late start made in this session. The committee recommended two additional aspects to the reporting framework: to examine consumption-based emissions&#8212;the emissions in other countries for which Scotland is responsible&#8212;and the means of publishing data on cumulative emissions. Notwithstanding the minister's response to Alison McInnes a few moments ago, the Government's written response to the committee report has little to say on those and we will explore them further at stage 2.</p><p>The committee also recommended that the Government produce far more detail on key <place-holder colnum=\"17102\"/> sectors of the economy: land use, transport, energy generation and energy saving. How much weight can those sectors pull? The Government responded by pointing to its intention to produce a draft indicative delivery plan some time in summer, presumably after the bill is passed. Fifty months after coming to office, the Government will have its first draft indicative ideas about where the cuts will come from&#8212;that is early action.</p><p>The transport issues that the committee addressed were mostly to do with aviation and shipping. We heard from the Sustainable Development Commission more recently; in its view, transport remains in general the area with the greatest mismatch between rhetoric and reality. The inclusion of aviation and shipping emissions is welcome, but there remain significant unanswered questions, not least on radiative forcing&#8212;as the committee noted&#8212;and on the Government's intentions for aviation growth.</p><p>I must also note that since the publication of the committee's report there have been suggestions that some in the industry are lobbying for a return of the air route development fund. It would be instructive to know whether the cabinet secretary considers such a proposal compatible with the climate change objectives.</p><p>At paragraph 202 of our report, we make a very clear call for public engagement to be put at the heart of the agenda, not just on policy development or strategy documents but in relation to public acceptance, positive attitudes, a can-do spirit, a willingness to think about shared and personal responsibilities, community efforts and lifestyle changes. The Government response on that recommendation is also disappointing. References to stakeholder discussions over the summer suggest that it has the wrong end of the stick.</p><p>On the need for scientifically informed debate, the Government claims to have considered the best evidence available. However, repeatedly, the committee heard concerns that, for the most part, the primary source is the IPCC's fourth report. Even those who worked on that report now acknowledge that it is already out of date. The cabinet secretary referred to Copenhagen and the most recent scientific announcements.</p><p>We were surprised that the Government has not yet formally consulted the UK Committee on Climate Change. It states in its response that it believes that it would be premature to do so, yet we as members will be expected to address scientific evidence in support of amendments at stage 2. I hope that the Government will recognise that evidence needs to come from a broader base than simply the IPCC's fourth report.<place-holder colnum=\"17103\"/></p><p>The final thought that I will share is my pleasure that the bill has been introduced during a period of minority government.

What is strange in Scotland is that our political debate is currently dominated by two major political parties, each of which has one foot in government and one foot in opposition&#8212;and that is the case in difficult circumstances. We might have to muddle through without even a glimmer of consensus until at least one party shifts at least one foot.</p><p>Much has been said about the blame that should be apportioned for the current economic context&#8212;the crisis in the context of which budgets are being set at all levels of government. I have repeatedly argued that blame for the current context can be laid at the door of a flawed economic model, which has been consistently supported by the Labour, Conservative, SNP and Liberal Democrat parties during their various stints in government during the past few decades. I do not expect to win members over to my position in a few words in this debate. In any case, the context is out there, regardless of different opinions about where to lay the blame. We are in the situation that we are in; we all face the same problems.</p><p>Labour has responded to the problems with an amendment that contains a glowing endorsement of everything in the UK Government's budget. We can dismiss that position. The Liberal Democrat amendment adds that the VAT cut was probably a poor idea. That is true, so I can support the amendment&#8212;it is unhelpful, but it is true. The Government motion highlights the problem simply by restating it but leaves me none the wiser about the response. It leaves me none the wiser than I was two years ago about what it means to talk about supporting a sustainable economy. That remains as unclear as it has ever been. The Government talks about &#163;500 million of cuts but is still unable to answer the question of where they will come from.</p><p>The Conservative amendment asks us to note, not endorse, the CPPR's views and analysis and asks for contingency plans. That seems reasonable but, to be fair, it is already happening. However, there will be a problem if those contingency plans cannot be developed alongside some degree of political consensus and, as I said, we do not have the best possible beginning for the development of such consensus.</p><p>The Green take on the context in which the UK Government has set its budget&#8212;we are now joined in this analysis by the Sustainable Development Commission, which launched its report \"Prosperity without Growth? The transition to a sustainable economy\" this week&#8212;is that the recession, as well as posing serious threats to our wellbeing, requires us to re-evaluate what we mean by wellbeing and prosperity. That would move us away from the gross domestic product fixation from which the Government at both levels <place-holder colnum=\"17021\"/> still suffers. I am afraid to say that the Conservative amendment appears to display the same fixation.</p><p>Much has been said at all levels of government about a green stimulus, a green new deal and a low-carbon recovery. That is becoming common language, but the 7 per cent of the UK's fiscal stimulus that is being directed towards green measures is well below the European average. The UK compares even more poorly with China at 36 per cent and South Korea at more than 80 per cent. The consensus that the UK budget is a missed opportunity appears to be justified. In fact, in the words of Friends of the Earth, the Government has blown an historic opportunity to turn its words about a green recovery into reality. Perhaps the clearest symbol of that failure is the car scrappage scheme. Bus manufacturers and turbine manufacturers are going under, construction companies stand ready to implement a massive housing retrofit programme to cut energy waste and fuel bills, but Mr Mandelson and Mr Darling think that it is more important to give people a bung to get more cars on to the roads.</p><p>As well as talking about what is wrong with the UK budget, we need to discuss what is missing from it. We need to change the way in which Governments set their budgets. A carbon assessment process for budgets would be the first mechanism for placing economic decisions into the proper ecological context. Too often, people talk about balancing the environment and the economy as though they were two separate parts of an equation, but we need to understand that the economy exists within an ecological context&#8212;in fact, within ecological limits.</p><p>A carbon assessment process, alongside legally binding emission reduction targets will be the first expression of that&#8212;not the last but the first. How much progress have we had towards that? Legislation is in hand to set such targets in place in Scotland and is already on the books for the UK. We have commitments on the carbon assessment of the budget that were gained from Scottish Government ministers during negotiations last year but not a great deal of progress to date. At UK level, there has been even less progress, although individual measures in the budget have some degree of carbon assessment. I cite the assessment of the measures to support oil extraction, which appears to say that they will have no climate change impact. However, 2 billion barrels of oil represents 800 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Mike Rumbles talks about the low price of oil; the price may be low for a short while longer, but the cost remains damagingly high.</p><p>The Scottish Government's motion requires some clarification. It implies that the carbon assessment process will be produced alongside <place-holder colnum=\"17022\"/> the draft budget proposals for 2010-11, not when we have agreed to the budget. I need an explicit commitment of that implicit statement. Will the full rigorous carbon assessment be published alongside the draft budget proposals for 2010-11? That would be real progress from the Scottish Government.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14955594", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: United Kingdom Budget (Implications for Scotland)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It has been observed that if government brings with it the burden of responsibility, a spell in opposition might   offer some freedom and flexibility.

Perhaps if the motion had been specific about the kind of transport investment that the previous Administration pushed, against all the facts and even the conclusions of a public local inquiry, when it approved the M74 extension, there would be only two votes against it&#8212;not for the first time and, I am sure, not for the last. From the two Liberal Democrat speeches so far, it is clear that the Liberal Democrats' enthusiasm for the worst environmental decision taken by the previous Administration has not dimmed since they left the coalition.</p><p>My case is that we need not incremental improvements to the existing system but transformational change&#8212;a dramatic shift to walking, cycling and public transport, not as an addition, but to produce far lower levels of car traffic. I have made that point before and will do so again. Creating such transformational change would require substantial investment. Every political party and MSP who talks a good game on sustainable transport should ask themselves why schemes such as Glasgow crossrail have gathered dust on the shelf for so many years. Perhaps Christina McKelvie's intervention earlier in the debate gives us a clue as to the reason: some simply cannot help taking every opportunity to attack a public transport scheme for being expensive, while supporting consistently for years, at immense cost, schemes to increase the capacity of the road network. Des McNulty should not dismiss as a financial overhang&#8212;as though it can be forgiven on that basis&#8212;the absurdity of sinking hundreds of millions, even billions, of pounds into increasing the capacity of the road network, either in Glasgow or over the Forth. In fact, that is an appallingly damaging example of 1960s thinking and an utter waste of money.</p><p>Rightly, the Labour motion raises the issue of social justice in the context of transport, which is important. I ask Des McNulty and the colleague who will close for Labour to follow through on the logic of that by making bus users, rather than car users, the priority. The road or motor lobby is phenomenally powerful in political terms, but bus users barely have a voice. I ask Labour members <place-holder colnum=\"16691\"/> to think about the impact of pollution from schemes such as the M74 extension and other projects that increase road traffic levels. Clearly, pollution has a disproportionate impact on communities that already suffer from multiple forms of deprivation. Both pollution and the impact of transport are social justice issues.</p><p>I will use the second part of my speech to be a little more positive&#8212;it is not unrelenting criticism. The amendment that I lodged referred not only to walking, cycling and public transport as parts of a sustainable transport system but to the use of the River Clyde, which has been much ignored. The river has a substantial history of use as a commuter and transport route, and it is good that attempts are beginning to be made to return it to that use. It could again be a major transport route for the west of Scotland, serving some of the communities that Jackie Baillie mentioned in the context of roads, which could use the river as a more sustainable transport route.</p><p>The findings of a recent study by Glasgow City Council demonstrate that there is core demand for a water bus service. The council believes that that demand will increase once it has been provided for. A water bus service could encourage modal shift. We must think about what modal shift means. Often what we see is modal spread&#8212;more of everything&#8212;but what we need is modal shift. The council argues that a water bus service would support on-going economic development and regeneration along the waterfront and&#8212;in yet another use of my least favourite form of jargon&#8212;talks about improving connectivity between the north and south banks of the river. The point is fair, even if the jargon is a bit unwieldy for my taste. The council also argues that the service could be seen as part of a world-class public transport network in Glasgow. What a vision that could be. Oh for the day when it is made a reality, instead of our pouring ever more concrete into the transport system, with all the impact that that has.</p><p>I will support the Labour motion, but I cannot welcome the Conservative amendment. I express no disappointment at all at the fact that the M74 extension was delayed; I wish only that it could have been delayed by a few more decades.</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14940410", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Transport Infrastructure (West of Scotland)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Stuart McMillan's final point, that there is sometimes a mismatch between what Administrations say on transport and what they do, is fair.

If I remember rightly, when we looked at our work plan originally we thought that we had a little more time than we ended up with. We thought that we would have a little time on our hands, so we looked for a topic that would fill a slot before deliberations began on the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill. In the end, we were tighter for time than we expected, but I am glad that we alighted on the topic of high-speed rail when considering our work plan. Given the announcements from the United Kingdom Government during our inquiry, it could hardly have been timelier.</p><p>The question of high-speed rail stretches far back&#8212;as far back as the 1960s. While the UK was busy ripping up its railway system, other countries, including some of our European neighbours, were looking forward to a high-speed rail future. By the 1980s and 1990s, high-speed lines were being built and services began to operate. However, the UK's only connection to that emerging high-speed rail network was the Channel tunnel, and that remains the case.</p><p>For years, there has been no answer to the question of the future of investment in new high-speed routes, but that question is now rather closer to being answered. After the various studies conducted by Greengauge 21, Atkins consultants and others, the case began to be developed more fully. Last year, Network Rail announced a strategic review of the case for new lines, and in evidence to our inquiry expressed the hope that it would develop a business plan for one or more new lines with the option for them to operate as high-speed lines.<place-holder colnum=\"16614\"/></p><p>Soon afterwards, the House of Commons Transport Committee criticised the UK Government's position, which up until that point had not supported the case for high-speed rail. Then, towards the end of last year, as our inquiry was on-going, a welcome change of tone emerged from Whitehall. Just into the new year, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that a new company, called High Speed Two, would be established to consider the case for new high-speed rail services between London and the north-east of England and Scotland.</p><p>As those events gather pace, it is essential that Scotland fights its corner and makes the case clearly that if high-speed rail is to be built, it should be built all the way to achieve the maximum possible gain in journey times. Journey time was one theme of many witnesses' evidence. The idea was put to us with some force that a journey time of around three hours could be regarded as something of a tipping point, because it would encourage people to move from less sustainable modes of transport&#8212;aviation in particular&#8212;and start using the railways.</p><p>I think that I speak for several members in the chamber when I say that I already find the railways a convenient and comfortable way of getting down south. However, if we want to encourage modal shift and increase the use of that railway route, we should consider seriously that three-hour journey tipping point as well as the other factors that improve the case for high-speed rail.</p><p>How does that case break down? An economic case was put to us very clearly. Like many witnesses, many members will want to emphasise it. For some, it is a question of simply increasing all forms of connectivity, as the jargon puts it; for others, it is a straightforward transport case, more to do with improving the network&#8212;a natural extension of an incremental improvement in the existing network, which already faces congestion. However, it is possible to reduce journey times on the existing conventional network by only a small amount. We can carry on reducing journey times and improving reliability, but that will take us only so far, given the capacity problems that we already face. Before we even think about the economy or the environment, the transport case for a rail network that meets people's needs is clear.</p><p>I turn to the environmental case, on which there have been differing views. My attitude changed during the inquiry. There are questions to ask in considering whether high-speed rail is the best investment to make, given that it could cost tens of billions of pounds and take decades to get the system up and running. It occurred to me that people might ask whether their local commuter route or station should be the priority for <place-holder colnum=\"16615\"/> investment. On a day when we are seeing increases in fares, we should ask whether reducing fares should be a priority.</p><p>People referred to the more-of-everything approach. It is clear that increased high-speed rail plus increased aviation does not result in a carbon saving. There was a question about the CO<sub>2</sub> impacts of high-speed travel itself. The different technologies have different impacts on the environment. However, I am pleased that the committee agreed, without dissent, that high-speed rail can deliver environmental benefits. At paragraph 59 of our report we agree that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"High-speed rail will only deliver environmental benefits if it is introduced in the context of other policy initiatives such as proposals to reduce our reliance on aviation and the use of renewable sources of electricity to power trains.\"</p><p>That is a clear conclusion. It is clear that there is an environmental case for high-speed rail, as well as an economic case, in addition to arguments about simply keeping the transport system working properly. High-speed rail should not be seen as the environment versus the economy. In fact, this is one area in which we should say that environmental and economic initiatives can be taken in conjunction.</p><p>The committee appreciated the opportunity to engage with the UK Government. I am sure that the minister will say that the Scottish Government is also engaged in dialogue with the UK Government. Long after this committee report is debated, we will have to keep making Scotland's case in the debate about the UK's high-speed rail network. If we are serious about building high-speed rail from Scotland to the south&#8212;to England and on to the continent&#8212;we will need a business case, political consensus and a delivery process that makes sense not just on day one; we will need them to be capable of withstanding several changes of Government at UK and Scotland level to maintain the momentum and ensure that the idea becomes a reality. That is not straightforward or easy, but if we can begin to develop and express that consensus, we will have a chance to make the case.</p><p>The committee's report has raised questions about the details of routes, such as whether we go for an upgrade of existing routes or a new route, and how we get into city centres. I am sure that members and the minister will want to cover those points. I thank all those who contributed to the production of our report, which is a useful starting point in a debate that I hope will be consensual not just today but in the months, years and decades that it could take to get a system of high-speed rail from Scotland to the south up and running.<place-holder colnum=\"16616\"/></p><p>I move,</p><p>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's 1st Report, 2009 (Session 3): <em>Report on the Inquiry into the potential benefits of high-speed rail services</em> (SP Paper 219).</p>", "hdate": "2009-04-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14931820", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: High-speed Rail Services"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "In speaking to the motion and committee report, I begin, as is traditional, by thanking my committee colleagues who contributed to our work, the various witnesses who gave us evidence both written and in person, and the clerking team who supported us in producing the report.

It states that, from day one in office, the Government has been clear about its central purpose being to create success on the basis of sustainable economic growth. I agree that the Government has been clear in setting that objective, but it has been unclear in explaining what that means. It is the latest in a series of verbal tricks. First, we had economic growth, then economic development, then sustainable economic development and now sustainable economic growth. Each of those verbal tricks has attempted, over the years, to distract us from the fundamental question in the modern economy: can everlasting growth be sustained on a planet of finite resources? Every other political party in the chamber, so far, remains at least formally committed to arguing that it can be.</p><p>The aim is growth everlasting and, despite the linguistic gymnastics that are used to imply otherwise, growth that is to be pursued regardless of the social and environmental impacts. For decades, a vision of everlasting growth based on conspicuous consumerism has been pursued by Governments of all mainstream political persuasions around the world. That has led to a society in which people are encouraged by a torrent of advertising to judge their worth as <place-holder colnum=\"16304\"/> human beings on the basis of how much stuff they consume.</p><p>The recession should be taken as a hard lesson about the meaning of unsustainable economics. We have seen debt piled upon debt, with transactions spiralling out of all proportion to the value of the goods and services that are produced in the real world. We have seen patterns of production and consumption that have been hideously mismatched to people's actual needs and a handful of individuals growing obscenely wealthy playing at masters of the universe. Some of us have been arguing for years that the prevailing economic model, which has left half the world too thin, half the world too fat and vital natural resources plundered and squandered, is doomed to failure. The question is this: does economic recovery mean resurrecting that failed model or finding something new?</p><p>Mr Swinney described a transition to a clean, green economy. That is, indeed, an important part of our response. Many Governments see that as part of a stimulus approach and are spending on infrastructure that we will need in the 21<sup>st</sup> century instead of more of the same. China and South Korea are perhaps the most ambitious examples of that approach, and the United States of America is doing something similar. However, the UK's green investment package is not even halfway up the table of the green investment packages of European countries.</p><p>What of the Scottish Government's response? I am bound to point out that the remarks on energy efficiency in the Government's progress report are the mere remnants of a failed attempt by my colleagues and I to persuade the Government to do the whole job for the whole of Scotland, which would have cost something like &#163;100 million a year for 10 years, which is less than the price of one mile of the M74. Instead of that, we have &#163;15 million. At that rate, we will barely finish half the task by 2050.</p><p>Should we welcome even that small amount as at least the beginning of a transformation? I am afraid not. It is a supplement. Alongside that investment in the green alternative&#8212;in what should be transition or transformation&#8212;we see more of the same: unnecessary roads and bridges, more coal-fired power stations and airport expansion. Every country is guilty of the same thing&#8212;I do not lay this entirely at Mr Swinney's door. However, even if green investment is being seen as part of a green stimulus, it is an attempt to stimulate the corpse of what went before, resurrecting a failed economic model; it is like Dr Frankenstein applying a few volts to the severed frogs' legs on the bench in front of him, seeing them twitch and crying out in triumph, \"It's alive!\" <place-holder colnum=\"16305\"/> Well, it is not. The animal remains, in any real sense, a lifeless form.</p><p>Is that metaphor intended to represent the Scottish economy? Am I saying that our economy is dead? No, of course not. However, the notion of abolishing bust and having boom forever&#8212;the notion of everlasting growth&#8212;is dead. The era of treating energy as a cheap commodity is over. The persistent habit of human beings living beyond our means, financially and ecologically, must be killed off too.</p><p>What does economic recovery mean? Recovery does not mean keeping a dying patient alive for one more day, still in pain, still dependent on a life-support system provided, in this case, by the Treasury. It means treating the underlying sickness.</p><p>An economic recovery plan for Scotland that understood recovery as healing rather than reanimation would have at its heart three key aspects. First, it would have new ways of defining economic progress, including all its impact on human life and our environment, not just growth, and would understand that the word \"economy\" shares its roots with \"ecology\" and is about more than just money. Secondly, it would have clear definitions of the social and ecological limits within which the economy must exist and a sense of how the private, public and third sectors can work together to achieve them. Thirdly, it would involve an all-out attack on the shallow and selfish values of consumerism. The age of me me me, more more more, greed and overconsumption must die if something more sustainable and human is to be allowed to live.

There are reasons why, in establishing a Scottish Parliament, we took the view that the police should be under the devolved competence of this Parliament and the Scottish Executive, as it was then. As an MSP, I do not want to control the design of the uniforms that they wear or the sign over their headquarters doors; it is the exercise of powers that is important. If the proposed powers are to be given to the self-same immigration officers who have been kicking in doors in Glasgow at 6 in the morning and dragging children from their mothers' arms, we should not just be expressing concern; we should fundamentally be saying no, that is not acceptable.</p><p>The Court of Session offers critical protection to people in the asylum system who appeal against the wrong decisions that are often taken by tribunals. How can we justify taking that critical right of appeal away from the Court of Session and out of the justice system, and giving it to the tribunal system, a system whose purpose is not to deliver justice but to say no to the maximum number of people? It is clear that the immigration tribunal system is designed for that purpose. Anyone who has witnessed its operation in Glasgow or elsewhere should share that view. It is a mockery of justice to argue that a fair appeal could be heard at that tribunal, which is the same body that made the decision in the first place.</p><p>I agree with the Scottish Refugee Council, which says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is highly questionable whether this Tribunal\",</p><p>which<place-holder colnum=\"16072\"/></p><p class=\"indent\">\"writes its own Rules ... will in fact have the status and independence of the Court of Session and hence whether this contentious area of law will continue to receive the ... scrutiny it requires.\"</p><p>I agree with the council, and I would go further: it would be a mockery of justice.</p><p>There are other issues in the bill, some of which are devolved and some of which are not. Some of them seem as if they should be covered by the LCM, but are not. Clause 47, for example, allows an additional condition to be imposed on those who are granted leave to remain&#8212;a condition restricting their studies in the United Kingdom. The Scottish Government has done far better than its predecessor in allowing asylum seekers and refugees who have been granted leave to remain to take up opportunities to study.

Do we see anything in the bill that would end the detention of children? Even the UK Government has accepted that that is clearly in breach of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Any bill on immigration that sought to put some compassion back into the system would scrap the detention of children. But no, there is not a word in the bill to that effect.</p><p>I ask the cabinet secretary this: do his party colleagues at Westminster, including the First Minister, who represents his constituency at Westminster, intend to vote for or against the bill?

I endorse that, but it is worth exploring a little further the reasons for that level of underreporting. The easy explanation, certainly with regard to offences relating to sexual orientation, would be to dismiss underreporting as simply a hangover from the days of criminalisation that will disappear through time, as generations move forward. However, I do not think that that is the case and I think that comparing it with the level of underreporting that exists with regard to offences relating to disability demonstrates that the existence of prejudice and bullying in schools is one of the things that continually undermine the likelihood of raising those levels.</p><p>I commend the Government for the work that it is doing, particularly in its response to the \"Challenging Prejudice\" document and the education aspects that it contains. There is much <place-holder colnum=\"15906\"/> in the document that we must build on, and I hope that the bill is seen as being integrated with that approach. We need to ensure that, as the generations move on, we continue to make progress towards that Scotland in which all people are treated with dignity and respect.</p><p>Bill Aitken asserted that those who are convicted should be left in no doubt that courts take these offences seriously, and I am glad that he is persuaded of the need for legislation. He also mentioned freedom of speech. While I agree with his conclusion and that of the committee in that regard, I want to pick up on the language that was used in paragraph 118 of the committee's report, which refers to those who hold</p><p class=\"indent\">\"traditional, mainstream beliefs about marriage and sexuality\".</p><p>I am not aware that any of the mainstream churches submitted evidence on the bill, or that they have expressed a view one way or another. I question whether views on sexuality that I might describe as outdated and antique are still mainstream views. I do not think that they are any more. We need to move beyond that.</p><p>Bill Aitken acknowledged that sentencing is a complex matter. It is important to remember that, under the proposals, courts will retain flexibility. Varying a sentence might be necessary if the motivation of the offender demonstrates a continued threat to society. That could, in some circumstances, justify a longer custodial sentence. However, alternative, non-custodial sentences might be appropriate in other circumstances. Paul Martin explored some of those issues, too. I reassure him that I do not want to abolish the jail. We might have disagreed in previous debates about the appropriate use of prison sentences, but I do not think that anyone wants to abolish the jail. I think, however, that we should use it more carefully.</p><p>We need to be careful to monitor the effectiveness of sentences. However, the committee agreed&#8212;I think that Paul Martin would agree, too&#8212;that mandatory sentences are not appropriate for the aggravation of what could be a serious, or a much more minor, offence.</p><p>Robert Brown began by referring to the right for all people to freedom from discrimination, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He emphasised that such rights have to be claimed, guarded and protected because they are not automatically accessed by all people equally. The bill will give clarity to the courts and the public, which will help us to do that.</p><p>Robert Brown mentioned the efforts that we have to make to overcome prejudice, and argued that building a society without the crimes that the bill is concerned with is dependent on seeing <place-holder colnum=\"15907\"/> others as real people and overcoming ignorance and prejudice. I endorse that strongly.</p><p>Linda Fabiani made some important points about HIV status, which is covered in the disability definition. Although treatment options have improved dramatically and many HIV positive people live long and healthy lives, stigma and discrimination have not gone away.</p><p>Bill Butler and other members mentioned the long history of the proposal, which has led, at last, to consensus. It is important to remember that the aggravations under the bill are not restricted to specific victim groups. Racial aggravation is not limited to minority ethnic groups and neither is the sexual orientation aggravation limited to lesbian, gay or bisexual people; they apply to all people who can be given protection in law from crimes that are motivated by prejudice.</p><p>Hugh O'Donnell and Marlyn Glen spoke of the work of the Equal Opportunities Committee. I express my thanks to the committee for its work on the bill. It is entirely appropriate for the Parliament to examine the potential for age and gender, too, to come under the mechanism of statutory aggravation. Even if we agree&#8212;I think that we have agreed&#8212;that the mechanism is inappropriate in tackling the type of offence that is aggravated by prejudice based on someone's age or gender, we should agree, absolutely and universally across the chamber, that that is no reason for us ever to relent from the drive against those forms of violence. When we take account of the circumstances under which the offences are committed, we may agree that we need to approach gender-based violence and violence and prejudice on the ground of age not by way of legislation, but in other ways. That said, I am sure that the whole Parliament agrees that we should not relent from the task.</p><p>David McLetchie made one or two contentious comments, but I endorse strongly his clear exploration of the ways in which hate crime can be far more than a crime against one individual and can become a crime against a whole community. I thank him for those comments.</p><p>I cannot finish without mentioning Anne McLaughlin. First, I thank her for her birthday wishes, which are much appreciated. However, I am not sure about the moon bringing out my community mindedness. I am more excited by the spring sunshine at the moment; it is having more effect on me than anything else is. As for the horoscope advising me to be tactful in dealing with the boss, I would have thought that the advice was more for SNP members than for someone in my party. I take her comments in good part.</p><p>Anne McLaughlin moved on to address the serious issue of mental health. People with mental <place-holder colnum=\"15908\"/> health problems are another poorly understood outgroup in society. Many people like to think that mental health issues apply to other people and not to themselves, but any one of us can experience mental health issues, and many of us will during our lifetimes. I return to Robert Brown's point: we need to see others as real people, with whom we can have empathy. That is one of the most important ways of overcoming prejudice and discrimination.</p><p>The bill has been described as small but perfectly formed. Indeed, as its proposer, I have been described in similar terms. Robert Brown described it as a modest bill. I am not sure that that description is equally applicable. I believe that the bill, and the wider action that Government is taking&#8212;right across the policy spectrum&#8212;will integrate to overcome prejudice and discrimination.

I also thank the 45 members who added their names in support of the proposal to enable it to reach stage 1.</p><p>I mentioned the working group on hate crime that was established by the previous Administration, but the issue is older than that. Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the Westminster Parliament required that the aggravation of an offence by racial prejudice should be taken into account in sentencing. That was the first time a statutory basis was given to the use of aggravation as a means of addressing hate crime. After that, Donald Gorrie extended the concept&#8212;he was successful in amending the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill that was passed during the Parliament's first session&#8212;by using the same mechanism to address religious prejudice. At that time, my colleague Robin Harper made a similar attempt to include prejudice on other grounds, including sexual orientation and disability. Robin Harper's amendments were not accepted by the Government at that time, but they led to the working group on hate crime.<place-holder colnum=\"15872\"/></p><p>It is perhaps a little frustrating that it is only now, seven years later, that Parliament will have the opportunity to vote on a proposal to implement the working group's key recommendation, but there we are&#8212;such things sometimes move slowly. There have been delays, but I am hopeful that we will reach agreement tonight that a mechanism that is an important part of Scotland's response to crimes of prejudice should be extended to additional categories.</p><p>What is the evidence of the extent of the problem that the bill seeks to address? I acknowledge that one reason why we need legislation to provide a statutory basis for such aggravations is to build up a clearer set of data&#8212;a clearer picture&#8212;on the issues, although we know that the problems exist and are significant. In 2008, the charity Scope published a report that found that 47 per cent of disabled people in the UK had either experienced physical abuse or had witnessed physical abuse of a disabled friend.</p><p>The report also stated that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"disabled people were four times more likely to be violently assaulted than non-disabled people\"</p><p>and that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"visually impaired people were four times more likely to be verbally and physically abused than sighted people.\"</p><p>It also pointed out that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"people with mental health issues were 11 times more likely to be victimised\".</p><p>In 2003, a survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Scotland found that 23 per cent had been physically assaulted because of their sexual orientation or transgender identity. According to a survey by the Scottish transgender alliance, 21 per cent of transgender people have experienced violent or sexual assault that was motivated by prejudice towards them.</p><p>We also know&#8212;increasingly, Scottish police forces are responding to this with real concern&#8212;that many people simply do not report such crimes to the police. Perhaps people fear being outed, do not expect a supportive response or cannot be bothered with the hassle. Perhaps people have simply come to believe that such offences are to be expected and should be accepted as a normal part of their lives.</p><p>Such crimes can have a profound impact on people's quality of life. If we leave aside serious violent offences, experiences of persistent low-level harassment, intimidation, vandalism and threats can be deeply demoralising and can come to reinforce an internalised prejudice that can leave many people believing that they are not worthy of the protection of the law. This Parliament should disagree&#8212;I hope that it will do so tonight.<place-holder colnum=\"15873\"/></p><p>In addition, we should consider the stress and emotional toll that many disabled people and transgender people deal with in engaging day to day with public institutions, which hold a great deal of power over the most intimate aspects of their lives and identities. In association with such experiences, hate crimes represent a level of harm that Parliament should not ignore.</p><p>The arguments in favour of the bill are clear. If we compare its provisions with the existing race and religion aggravations, we see a picture of a mechanism that is working effectively. I have not heard a single call&#8212;I doubt that any credible voice would do so&#8212;for abolition of the existing aggravations on race and religion. That leaves us with the long-standing question: If that is the right mechanism for those types of hate crime, why is it the wrong mechanism for other comparable types of hate crime? There is general agreement that the current aggravations are working and can be effectively used by the courts.</p><p>Such aggravations also help to ensure that we can find out the extent of the problem. In that context, I mention Bill Butler's recent written question, through which he was able to get from the Government information about the number of religious aggravation convictions in each procurator fiscal area. We are not able to find out the number of offences that are aggravated by prejudice because that information is simply not recorded, which is partly why we need to make aggravation by prejudice a statutory aggravation and why there should be a duty on courts to record their reasons for varying, or not varying, particular sentences.</p><p>The additional categories of aggravation with which the bill deals have been in place in England and Wales since 2003, and in Northern Ireland since 2004, with the exception of aggravation on the basis of transgender identity, on which I hope very much the other parts of the United Kingdom will catch up with us.</p><p>The creation of a new statutory aggravation will help the police and the courts to develop an approach that will encourage offences to be reported and will build confidence among members of the affected communities to increase reporting. It will also ensure that we pass appropriate sentences and that we build up a national picture of the extent of the problems, which will help us to make the most appropriate and most effective sentencing response.</p><p>Some people have argued that the flexibility that is inherent in the common law is sufficient to deal with the offences in question. In theory, it allows sentences to be varied, but in practice it is not used nearly enough. It is clear that there is less focus on the offences that we are discussing than there is on those that are defined in legislation. <place-holder colnum=\"15874\"/></p><p>Moreover, there are things that the common law cannot do. I repeat that if we record the number of such aggravations and build up a national picture, police forces will be able to gather intelligence that they can use to prevent future offences, which is far preferable to merely responding to offences.</p><p>An inconsistent approach is adopted to different types of hate crime. Many police forces want to respond coherently and consistently to the various manifestations of hate crime and would prefer the legislation to be consistent.</p><p>Some people have argued that the bill will create a hierarchy of victims or of rights, but even those who might once have argued that straight, white, able-bodied men would be left as an unprotected group in law have now come to reflect on their position and to recognise that that was an inappropriate response. Everyone has the right to be protected by the law&#8212;that will continue to be the case. However, we know that some sections of society are specifically targeted and made victims of crime. The bill is about adopting the appropriate response, given the motivation of the offender. It is about the motivation of the offender rather than the identity of the victim.</p><p>The bill will extend protection to anyone in society against whom an offence is committed because of their actual or presumed sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability. A hierarchy of rights exists in the minds of some people who commit such offences and who believe that their prejudice is justified and that their victims deserve what they get. The bill is about tackling and overturning that hierarchy.</p><p>It has been suggested that the new aggravation could be used maliciously, but it can be argued that the potential for misuse of it should not be a bar to legislating. We would not, simply on the basis that some people might be accused of it falsely, refuse to create a criminal offence if we thought that a phenomenon was real and was harmful. It is for the courts to determine whether the aggravation should stand and the sentence should be varied.</p><p>The witnesses from the Law Society of Scotland who explored some of the issues said that the existing statutory aggravations on race and religion are effective and useful, and that the introduction of new categories of aggravation would be beneficial. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland told the Justice Committee that it was not aware of any cases of false accusations relating to the aggravation of offences by racial or religious prejudice. It is a question of the appropriate and effective application of the law; any potential for misuse of the new aggravation should not be a bar to our passing the bill. Ultimately, it will be for the courts to make a decision on that.<place-holder colnum=\"15875\"/></p><p>Some people have argued that the bill raises an issue to do with freedom of speech. The Christian Institute said that the bill</p><p class=\"indent\">\"could give gay rights groups a legal mechanism for targeting those who disagree with them. It could undermine free speech and religious liberty\",</p><p>but it could not give a single example from south of the border of the misuse of such mechanisms leading to inappropriate convictions. I agree that those objections are not serious, which was the conclusion of the committee's report.</p><p>The bill is not a magic wand. It will not, in itself, spell an end to crimes of hatred against many in our society. I hope, however, that the bill will, combined with the other actions that the Government is taking to tackle prejudice in all its forms, help to mark the beginning of the end of the days when people felt that there was nothing they could do and that prejudice and hate crime were simply things that they should expect and accept.</p><p>I am happy to move, That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14855737", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to open the debate.

Understandably, it prompted some scathing speeches from Labour members, and some glowing ones from the SNP about how near to perfection the Government is. The reality, of course, is somewhat different. Governments have strengths and weaknesses, and even some of the worst have a few saving graces. However, the clearest signs of failure in government in the face of the climate crisis, the economic crisis and the impending energy crisis are, I am sad to say, shared across most of the political parties in the chamber, and many of them are to be found in the annex to NPF 2.</p><p>During the previous session of Parliament, I argued for a number of changes to the planning legislation that underpins the national planning framework and gives ministers the power to designate national developments. In particular, I wanted a more intensive period of parliamentary scrutiny, reflecting the importance of the national planning framework and its impact on communities throughout Scotland. I also wanted a process of examination in public to allow the arguments to be put in a formal manner before a plan is adopted, recognising that, even with the best public consultation processes&#8212;which, of course, have not been used in this instance&#8212;many people will not even be aware of the framework, let alone make a response to it. Crucially, I argued that the power to make the final decisions should remain with the Parliament and not be handed to <place-holder colnum=\"15558\"/> ministers. Despite raising the prospect of a future minority Government, I was unable to persuade the Government of the day that it should take seriously that fear.</p><p>Much of the document, as ministers describe it, is a mere expression of Government policy. That is not the case, however, with the proposed national developments. They represent the Government's clear intention to give planning status to those developments in a way that has not been done before.</p><p>I recognise the work of the Local Government and Communities Committee in producing the report. My committee and the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee also contributed to the scrutiny process. However, I have to say how disappointed I am and how much I disagree with the Local Government and Communities Committee's decision not to comment on the national developments in its final report, or even in the motion that is before us today. Doing so would have allowed members to vote on the issue.</p><p>Just weeks after the Parliament passed overwhelmingly what all parties agreed was a business-as-usual budget in climate change terms, we look set to give majority approval to a report on a framework that contains the most environmentally damaging developments that Scotland has seen in at least a generation. We will have new coal-fired power stations, but without the carbon capture and storage systems that I am sure the minister wishes he could offer. The new stations will merely have car parks that are big enough to fit such systems if ever they should prove workable.</p><p>The additional Forth road bridge is now explicitly a road-only crossing and an addition, not a replacement, for the existing bridge&#8212;at a time when the chief engineer at the bridge is saying clearly that his confidence in its preservation is high. It is clear that the new crossing will result in an increase in total road capacity over the Forth. No minister will find it politically possible to keep the existing bridge as a public transport-only crossing once angry queues start to grow at the entrance to the new crossing.</p><p>Airport expansion is a crucial issue. I admit that we are not talking about new runways, which the Liberal Democrats in charge of the City of Edinburgh Council are now demanding. Nonetheless, the Government is planning increased capacity to cope with rising levels of air travel, and that in the face of climate change.</p><p>Every political party seems now to be proud of its environmental rhetoric. Every party also seems likely to sign up to the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill in the coming weeks and months. The question remains, however, whether any party, <place-holder colnum=\"15559\"/> other than the Greens, is willing to put a stop to the Government's disastrous proposals that will so undermine that effort.</p><p>The Labour Party's amendment is admirable and I will, of course, support it. That said, Labour members have put themselves in the same position as their colleagues at Westminster, which is to both support high-speed rail and try to force through an additional runway at Heathrow airport. The Labour Party's answer seems to be to ask for more of everything&#8212;an answer that will ultimately prove to be nonsensical.</p><p>I cannot agree that the report, which contains no final judgment on the national developments, should form the basis of the Parliament's response to the Government. I deeply regret that the Parliament has been given no opportunity to approve or disapprove the national developments by way of a vote. Members who oppose the national developments should say so openly and those who support them in the face of the climate crisis should not get away with quietly nodding them through.</p>", "hdate": "2009-03-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14772080", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: National Planning Framework"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This morning, the Parliament debated a motion titled \"Scottish Government Failures\".

They recognise that recovery from the current economic situation will depend on substantial investment in low-carbon infrastructure. They recognise that we must not only generate energy more cleanly, but must cut our consumption radically. We in Scotland should <place-holder colnum=\"14678\"/> recognise the opportunities that such an approach could offer. Instead, the Government has continued to pile resources into projects that will increase carbon emissions. I have to go past one of them every morning on the bus coming out of the south side of Glasgow, where concrete piles are being driven into the ground to carry tens of thousands of additional car journeys into and out of the city centre.</p><p>We argued from a Green perspective that the budget was not supportable unless it incorporated, as a counterbalance, substantial measures along the lines that we have proposed. I am sad to say that, after months of trying to persuade the Government to adopt just one such positive measure, it still does not get it. The basis of our proposal has been not just scale but universality. A free, area-based approach is the only way to drive up participation rates to the high levels that are needed if we are to cut people's bills, preserve jobs in the construction sector and cut emissions. Sadly, the response that I have had from the Government following last week's debate demonstrates that it still does not get it.</p><p>Just today, the National Audit Office has published an assessment of previous fuel poverty campaigns that demonstrates that the target-and-miss approach will have to end. We cannot continue with that approach; if we want to eradicate fuel poverty and to cut our emissions, we need to adopt an approach to insulation that is based on free and universal provision.</p><p>We argued that that would cost in the region of &#163;100 million a year for a 10-year project. All the Government data that I have seen so far support that assessment. The Scottish Government's initial suggestion on the scale of what could be delivered, however, involved the provision of &#163;4 million a year. It would have taken more than three centuries for that scheme to complete the job throughout Scotland. Last week, a slightly larger scheme was offered, which involved the provision of &#163;22 million a year. It would have taken 44 years for that scheme to complete the job throughout Scotland. Even though the cabinet secretary stated that what was on the table last week remains on the table, he can guarantee only &#163;15 million a year from his own resources, which means it would take 65 years to complete the job throughout Scotland.</p><p>This morning, I lodged an amendment to the stage 3 motion, which offered Parliament a final opportunity to endorse the adoption of the free and universal approach for which we have argued.

I strongly support her view that Shelter Scotland should be rightly proud of the work that it has done. Its record is one of which many non-governmental organisations would be proud. I echo Jamie McGrigor's thanks to the many members of staff, activists and supporters of Shelter who have contributed to that record. Mary Mulligan said that we can all fondly recall our own 40 <sup>th</sup> birthdays. I can say only that I will let her know.</p><p>The progress that has been made over Shelter's 40 years should be put in context. I think Tricia Marwick was the first to mention \"Cathy Come Home\" in the debate&#8212;a film that had a profound impact. There is perhaps a sense that the scenes such are in that film might not be seen in Scotland any more. Perhaps the scenes of homelessness, poor housing or eviction that are around Scotland today have changed a bit, but I think members know that such scenes are comparable to those found in \"Cathy Come Home\". As Jamie Stone suggested, many local councillors also know that such scenes can be found in parts of Scotland today. Perhaps they have changed, though, so that a film today with the same kind of emotional impact as \"Cathy Come Home\" would show scenes of, for example, the Roma community in Govanhill in Glasgow, or the experiences of disabled people whose homes are not fit for their specific needs, which Mary Mulligan mentioned. Perhaps a film with such an emotional impact <place-holder colnum=\"14238\"/> today would say something more about the diversity of needs that we have come to recognise.</p><p>I wonder, though, whether such a film would have the same societal and political impact as \"Cathy Come Home\" had when people can today, without getting out of their chairs, press a button and turn on to television programmes such as \"Relocation, Relocation\", \"Grand Designs\" and \"Property Ladder\", or other programmes that provide similar images. Those are the images of housing that people see on their television screens today. They are aspirational and are about a completely different set of values from those that inspired the makers of \"Cathy Come Home\".</p><p>Those aspirational values need to be challenged in the political sphere. There has been a great increase in home ownership over the decades. No doubt, there are good and positive aspects to that, but there is a downside as well. Part of that is the con that has been perpetrated that the increasing value of people's homes is a form of wealth; it is not a form of wealth but a trap that many people have fallen into. A young couple can buy a home, then read enthusiastically in the newspapers that property values are going up.

As the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee discovered, this is a business-as-usual budget. At a time when we face economic crisis, climate crisis and impending energy crisis, the case for a fundamental change of direction for our society and economy is irresistible.</p><p>In the previous session, when the Executive had a majority, there were occasions when we voted no, voted yes following constructive changes or abstained when the arguments were finely balanced. We reserve the right to take any such position in this session. SNP members have warned Parliament not to jeopardise the budget. In the past, I have argued that in a period of minority <place-holder colnum=\"13962\"/> government all members and political parties have a serious responsibility to enter into constructive dialogue during the budget process and actively seek agreement. However, we should also remember that it is the cabinet secretary's responsibility to build consensus&#8212;or, at the very least, a majority. That requires him to compromise and to take seriously others' constructive suggestions.</p><p>Our approach has been to bring constructive suggestions into direct dialogue with the Government, not to drop in last-minute demands that are unrealistic, unachievable or unwise&#8212;a strategy adopted by some that seems to be designed as a positioning exercise rather than to advance serious proposals. We prefer to pursue detailed discussions, months in advance, and to maintain an active interest in the delivery of the budget as the money goes out the door. Last year we took that approach, which led to constructive work on the Government's limited spending on walking and cycling; on third sector budgets, which now support credit unions, among others; and on the climate challenge fund, which is empowering communities across Scotland to cut greenhouse gas emissions in radical and creative ways, tackling climate change and building resilience for the age after peak oil. Despite those and other agreements last year, there were too many areas, notably on transport, where we could not drop our criticisms; like others, we abstained in the final vote.</p><p>This year we are taking the same constructive approach. We seek sufficient changes to the 2009-10 budget to allow us to support it, but such changes will have to be significant. Our first priority&#8212;which every political party should be able to support, budget or no budget&#8212;is a dramatic increase in the rate of home insulation throughout Scotland. We have looked at what our colleagues in Kirklees Council down south have delivered by taking an area-based approach&#8212;working street by street and door by door. Rather than setting up a phone line and waiting to see who calls, they have knocked on doors and done the work. We need a universal approach, with no means testing, because otherwise&#8212;no matter what mechanisms are used to target fuel poverty&#8212;some people will fall through the cracks. The service must also be free: to ensure that we get the maximum uptake, we must remove the barriers of cost.</p><p>We have argued that scaling up the Kirklees programme to the whole of Scotland would have multiple benefits. Clearly, it would address the problems of climate change and peak oil&#8212;Scotland's total greenhouse gas emissions would be cut by about 6 per cent once the job was done. It would also help us to tackle fuel poverty by saving every household in Scotland hundreds of pounds a year. It would provide investment in jobs <place-holder colnum=\"13963\"/> and skills for which other political parties have rightly called&#8212;supporting what we argue should be a green investment-led recovery from the current economic crisis. Support for our proposals has come not only from environmental non-governmental organisations such as the John Muir Trust, Friends of the Earth Scotland, WWF Scotland and Energy Action Scotland, which we might expect to support us, but from the business sector&#8212;the Scottish Building Federation, Scottish Business in the Community and the Scottish Renewables Forum.</p><p>We believe that the work needs to be done on a dramatic scale. Our estimate is that it would cost about &#163;100 million a year, on top of what is spent already, to achieve a 10-year programme to cover the whole of Scotland. I entirely accept that the Government may have a different estimate, and if it can produce figures showing the number of jobs already done, which would not have to be included, let us hear them. If it can produce a different estimate of the cost savings using an area-based approach, which has an economy of scale built into it, let us hear what it is. We will not know that the Government is committing to such a project until we hear what the figures are.</p><p>The cabinet secretary understands the value of our proposal, and I think that he would like to be able to deliver it. He needs to make it clear to the Parliament that he intends to do so. He might have misspoken in his opening speech, so I will be clear. There are two elements to what we are arguing for. First, there is the advice, audit and insulation programme, which must be free, universal and area based, with the intention to cover the whole of Scotland over an ambitious timescale. That needs a clear commitment and Government funding. CERT money on its own&#8212;for meeting the carbon emissions reductions target&#8212;will not be sufficient.</p><p>The second element is a loan scheme, similar to the RE-charge scheme&#8212;for renewable energy&#8212;that operates in Kirklees, which removes the barriers of installation costs at hard-to-treat properties by enabling people to put off repaying them until they sell their properties. I know that the cabinet secretary's colleagues are working on the detail of that, but I need to hear his intention to introduce such a scheme.</p><p>There are people who argue that the environment slips down the agenda in a recession, but I ask: when better than during a recession to stop wasting energy and wasting money?

For a properly functioning democracy, a free and high-quality press is vital. Its importance is far greater than that of, for example, the blogosphere, although I would certainly defend the freedom of both.</p><p>High-quality journalism is necessary for high-quality press. High-quality journalism is not the same as reporting and it is not just copy or text. It depends not only on journalists themselves, but on the many other professionals who make the end product possible. Decent treatment of employees is essential not only for justice but for a high-quality, professional product.</p><p>Ted Brocklebank urges us to recognise the reality that the industry faces. I agreed with many of his comments, but I disagreed with some of them. Newspapers around the world are recognising that people have more choices of where to go for their news these days&#8212;where to go for their immediate coverage. However, journalism is something different. It is not just coverage or reporting. The thing that will make me carry on buying a high-quality newspaper, as well as going to the blogs, the BBC website and so on, is high-quality journalism&#8212;the kind of thing that we know we will get when we buy the paper.</p><p>What should Newsquest/Gannett or any other owner of a newspaper do to ensure that they can carry on safeguarding the product for the future? It should certainly not do what it is doing at the moment. How would we feel about MSPs who decided to treat their staff in a similar way by announcing sudden cuts just before Christmas, with mass redundancy and rerecruitment? How would we feel if we learned that one of our colleagues was scrapping an agreement that had been reached through collective negotiation through the unions; reducing working conditions in relation to sick pay, hours and shift patterns; cutting key posts and redefining hours; and causing increased stress among the remaining employees and a feeling that those who remained were working for a less-valued organisation, which was being not nurtured but neglected by its management? We would be ashamed of colleagues who treated their employees like that. If they were doing it at a time when our allowances for paying staff were being increased, we would be rightly outraged.<place-holder colnum=\"13746\"/></p><p>That scenario is analogous to what Newsquest/Gannett is doing. The resources that it has available and its profits are increasing and yet that is how it is treating its staff. That kind of behaviour will lead to a denuded and diminished product, not to a product that will have a future in the new reality, which Ted Brocklebank described accurately, in which people have many more choices of where to go for coverage.</p><p>If a public sector agency of the Scottish Government was treating its staff in this way in similar circumstances, we would not be debating it at 5 o'clock in a members' business debate; it would be the subject of anger and outrage every Thursday afternoon at 12 o'clock until it stopped.

The spike in energy and commodity prices was the first&#8212;although oil prices have come down following the spike, they are still at a high in historic terms, and that long-term trend is expected only to go up as the decades roll by. The second global change is the onset of global recession. We should not pretend that those two things are unconnected; it is clear that much of the global economy was a house of cards, which was unable to withstand an oil shock&#8212;and that will not be the last oil shock.</p><p>Of course, there will be a last oil shock&#8212;one from which we might never recover&#8212;unless we successfully manage the transition to a low-energy, low-carbon, low-waste economy. We should be asking several questions about the Government's budget. Does it begin to make that transition with a sense of urgency? Does it show how the transition can be a just one that ensures quality of life for all? Is the budget accompanied by a long-term vision from Government that shows understanding of the scale of change that is required and makes a commitment to the long-term task?</p><p>In answering those questions, I will speak in a personal capacity&#8212;as others did, including Iain Smith&#8212;and not on behalf of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee, although I will refer to its report. I thank the Finance Committee for accepting my committee's recommendation on a carbon commentary, which relates to the Government's long-term commitment to a comprehensive carbon assessment tool. That is a complex piece of work. How do we move from the simplistic approach of putting a financial price on carbon to understanding the carbon cost of all financial decisions so that we do not live beyond our ecological means? That is not simple.</p><p>The Government's work on a carbon assessment tool begins to demonstrate the long-term vision that I am calling for, as do some other aspects of its work, but the recommendation was needed because progress has been frustratingly slow. I cannot see the sense of urgency that I am calling for. As Alex Johnstone stated, in paragraph <place-holder colnum=\"13478\"/> 46 of its report, the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee agreed with the witnesses who told us that the spending proposals represent a business-as-usual budget. Carbon assessment will be a hugely important tool, but we do not have it yet, and the budget does not set out with a sense of urgency to facilitate the transition or ensure that it is just.</p><p>I will highlight two opportunities that the cabinet secretary could grasp to make the necessary changes during the budget process. The first is on sustainable transport. In paragraph 120 of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee's report, we supported an increase in funding for active travel. Transform Scotland, among other bodies, has demonstrated the economic benefits that can be achieved if we in Scotland reach the same levels of walking and cycling as some of our European neighbours.</p><p>If we must approach everything in terms of sustainable economic growth&#8212;the Government's central anomaly, as I call it&#8212;let us talk about the economic benefits that can be achieved from getting fitter, and reduce our reliance on rising fares and prices by getting on our bikes. That will have benefits for climate change, the economy, local environments and social justice. Walking and cycling are the cheapest, greenest and healthiest modes of transport, yet they seem to occupy the lowest rung of Government priorities.</p><p>The second opportunity is on energy. Not only was it covered in the evidence that the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee took, but a recent resolution of the Parliament called for substantial investment in the energy efficiency of housing stock and the retrofitting of Scottish homes with microrenewables. We need a commitment to that, not just this year but in the long term to ensure that the job is completed.</p><p>If we are to achieve our climate change targets, every home will have to be brought up to the standard of the best new homes that are being built today, or at least to be brought as close as possible to that standard. That is required not just because of climate change but as a response to peak oil and the impending energy crisis; as a response to concerns about health and wellbeing; as a response to the economic crisis, given the jobs and the benefits to household budgets that could arise; and as a response to fuel poverty.</p><p>Too many past programmes have targeted individuals on a means-tested basis, only for them to move on and end up in fuel poverty again in a different building. Abolishing fuel poverty means abolishing inefficient, energy-hungry homes. We can do that. Some of our colleagues in local government down south achieved it with some public investment and additional money from the energy companies through the carbon emissions <place-holder colnum=\"13479\"/> reduction target. We need a universal approach that is not means tested and which operates ward by ward, street by street, and door by door. People are already trying that approach in some small areas in Scotland&#8212;including in the cabinet secretary's constituency&#8212;and it works.</p><p>We propose the roll-out of a national programme along those lines. We can learn from what has worked in the past and reproduce it. That would show the long-term vision that is required from Government and the urgency that is needed in relation to the fundamental challenges. It would begin the transition that our society must undertake, and it would ensure that the transition is a just one that leaves communities stronger, more resilient and more able to meet their needs in good times as well as bad.</p><p>I commend the proposal to the cabinet secretary and look forward to his response.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14306117", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Budget Process 2009-10"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I acknowledge the work that the Finance Committee's members and its team have put into the budget scrutiny process and I thank them for their report.

I ask members to welcome to the public gallery the representatives of projects that have successfully bid for money from the climate challenge fund.</p><p>I am often given to comment on the status that climate change has achieved on the political agenda over the years. When I was a lad, I was taken along by my mum to various environmental demonstrations. I am pleased to say that she still goes to environmental demonstrations. It is fair to say that, in those days, climate change and other issues that were being raised by the environment movement were sometimes portrayed as being on the fringes of the political agenda.</p><p>However, over not only the short span of my life, but the decades since the concept of climate change first came to the awareness of scientists, we have reached the point at which the few who deny the issue, who deny the reality of the problem and who deny the serious impact that it will have on lives and economies around the planet are now portrayed as the fringe eccentrics on the edges of the issue. It has taken a long time to reach that point and it has taken a lot of work, not only by politicians but by communities and activists at community level. We are now at the point when ministers are asked questions about climate change every week in this Parliament: they have to respond and take the issue seriously.<place-holder colnum=\"13430\"/></p><p>We have reached the point at which the secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, today addressed the delegates at Poznan and called for a new climate revolution&#8212;in fact, for \"a new Copernican revolution\". That is how profound the issue is. Global solidarity is needed on climate change, which is the defining challenge of our era. Mr Ban argues that if banks are too big to fail, so is the climate. That is something on which we can all now agree, although there might not have been such agreement even a few short years ago.</p><p>We Greens have played our part constructively, not just here but around the world, although we certainly do not pretend that we are the only people to have done so. Other people in other political movements have done so, and people have played their parts in their own communities. We will continue to challenge the Government sometimes, issuing our criticisms as we did yesterday when we considered the strategic transport projects review. Criticism on its own is not enough, however, even when Governments fall short. It is necessary also to promote positive ideas about what can be achieved. That is the approach that we took to last year's budget negotiations, when we asked for the establishment of the climate challenge fund, which has presented an opportunity for communities to bid and to set their own agendas.</p><p>Although consensus has developed on climate change, something has fallen between the cracks. We have spoken about the relationship between Government, business and individuals. Who needs to play their part? Where does the balance of responsibility for climate change lie? It has been forgotten for a long time that, between Government, individuals and business, communities can collectively play a far more powerful role than any of us can individually. Cutting emissions directly is one thing, but communities can also set their own agendas and priorities. Different solutions will be appropriate in different towns and villages and in different parts of a city. The issues might be around food production, transport, buildings or lifestyle: people have a host of choices and opportunities.</p><p>If the Government simply comes along, wags the finger and tells communities how things are going to be, however, it risks its approach being rejected. The Government's allowing communities to set their own agendas, and providing a little bit of extra financial support can help to create a can-do spirit. That is what communities can do, which individual action&#8212;however important&#8212;cannot do on its own. With that can-do spirit, relationships can be built at community level, which can generate all sorts of spin-off benefits, whether in social justice or in economic wellbeing&#8212;which <place-holder colnum=\"13431\"/> means so much more than mere growth, of course.</p><p>In many ways, we face a pretty frightening time with the so-called triple crunch. We are facing an economic crisis, a climate crisis and an impending energy crisis&#8212;all three at once. Those are the consequences of generations of unsustainable politics and economics. They might be unprecedented challenges, but there are unprecedented opportunities, too. Creative solutions are available, not just for tackling climate change, but for working towards the concept of a sustainable community.</p><p>The Transition Network Ltd is one of the organisations that has benefited from the climate challenge fund. It is the inheritor of a set of ideas&#8212;a holistic sense&#8212;about what sustainable communities are. Over the years, we are going to have to build in concepts not just of low-carbon living but of resilience and self-reliance. If the climate crisis, the energy crisis and the economic crisis play out as some of us fear, the communities that will prosper and thrive, and which will be able to maintain wellbeing, will be those that can meet their needs locally. That might mean local food production, which the Toryglen gardening club is exploring. Other projects have benefited from the climate challenge fund.</p><p>I asked ministers recently whether they are aware of the land share concept: the idea that those who have spare land that is not being used can turn it into something productive and an asset for a community. That is very much what the folk in Toryglen are doing. They are working with churches, housing schemes and a host of people who can provide a little bit of land. That land can be the catalyst not just for producing food locally and cutting carbon emissions, but for bringing people together with their common interests&#8212;despite the frightening economic crisis.</p><p>I hope that members will refer to various projects around the country that are benefiting from the scheme and that are creating benefits for the communities that they serve. I have circulated to all members a map that shows where projects are around the country. There are many more of them in the pipeline.</p><p>In closing, I will mention Des McNulty's members' business debate next week, on the subject of eco-congregations. I am aware that the eco-congregations network is now a huge network of projects around the country. I hope that the network is positively considering the opportunities that the climate challenge fund offers.</p><p>I again thank members and the many activists from around Scotland who are making things happen. Without that, policies are worth very little.<place-holder colnum=\"13432\"/></p><p>I invite anyone who wishes to join us to committee room 4 for a little drink at the end of the debate.</p>", "hdate": "2008-12-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14303249", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Climate Change (Communities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "That should be just long enough for the dulcet tones of Lord Foulkes to disappear from the back of the chamber.

On the objective of affordable and high-quality public transport, I suspect that bus users or users of First ScotRail services, which we will debate in the chamber tomorrow morning, will know all about the price rises that they have seen and will question whether any approach is achieving high-quality and affordable public transport.</p><p>Let us look at the climate change objective in the strategy. The minister was happy to talk about a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes&#8212;I think that Rob Gibson echoed that figure&#8212;but I call that poor. The document claims that that represents a 1 per cent reduction in emissions from the transport sector. In fact, we are not talking about a 1 per cent reduction in emissions from the transport sector overall, because the 1 per cent relates only to the projects in the document. It ignores the fact that, for example, the M74 extension alone implies an additional 450,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per <place-holder colnum=\"13237\"/> year, which wildly overshadows the projects in the document.</p><p>Having a serious programme to boost active travel such as walking and cycling would be one of the best ways of helping to reduce the carbon emissions from transport. Why is there no sense in the document that that is a strategic objective that we are willing to spend big money on? Transport policy has long had an unstated objective that is not strategic, but psychological. I do not level this charge purely at the current Government, because it existed in the previous Scottish Government and exists in the UK Government. The objective is not about climate change, connectivity or the economy, but about vanity. Ministers of any political party love the idea that they can stand there cutting the ribbon, wearing their hard hat and smiling for their photograph, thinking, \"This is what I built! Look what I did! Aren't I a big strong minister?\" That objective has marred transport policy for far too long.</p><p>Let us look at one example of that objective. We can all see in our mind's eye Mr Salmond in his hard hat opening the new Forth crossing, but where has the multimodal element of that crossing gone? What about the contradictions in what the Government says about the existing bridge? It now seems to accept implicitly that the existing bridge can be repaired and will last, and that it is even strong enough for us to run trams over it. Well, if it is a robust, repairable bridge, why on earth do we need a new one, if not to increase road capacity, which runs entirely contrary to the climate change objectives?</p><p>There are contradictions, too, between paragraphs 30 and 31 in the minister's statement. Paragraph 30 says that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the existing bridge ... can be retained as a dedicated public transport crossing\".</p><p>However, paragraph 31 states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Sustainable public transport will be given priority in a dedicated public transport corridor\".</p><p>Well, which is it?

One of the most important things she said in her opening speech was that it is sometimes so difficult to get across, particularly to many young people, the message that HIV is still relevant.<place-holder colnum=\"12953\"/></p><p>In developed, rich countries with sophisticated health-care systems, HIV has changed into what is commonly termed a chronic manageable condition. That does not undermine in any way its importance, its seriousness and the impact it can have on someone's life, but it does make it difficult sometimes to get across the message that it is as important to combat HIV now as it always has been.</p><p>The global and domestic dimensions of HIV have already been mentioned. Those dimensions are sometimes so different that it almost seems as if we are talking about two different viruses rather than a single phenomenon. The situations that Kenny Gibson mentioned are very different from the situations that people in Scotland face. However, with migration, we can acknowledge that the connections between the global and domestic dimensions are deepening and becoming more complex.</p><p>We face a serious problem in Scotland. As other members have mentioned, we have rising infection rates while resources are dwindling and being less specifically allocated to HIV. We also have poor knowledge levels in comparison with the rest of the UK. There is a great deal more that we can do in that respect, but even that should not satisfy us. An increased level of knowledge and understanding is, in itself, no guarantee of prevention. Earlier this year, I spent some time in hospital with a close friend who had recently received his diagnosis. For many years he had been in contact with services, with youth work when he came out and with the available information. He was aware and had a high level of knowledge of HIV. In itself, such knowledge is no guarantee of prevention; it is necessary, but not sufficient.</p><p>It is important that we are bold and radical in our approach to school education and to out-of-school education for young people as well as for older people. That means that resources will be needed. It means that support and training will be required for teachers, youth workers and community workers. It also means that there must be political courage and a willingness on the part of Government&#8212;at national and local level&#8212;to challenge entrenched attitudes and not allow resistance to the taking forward of certain radical work on sexual and reproductive health. It certainly means taking on some of THT Scotland's proposals, for example for a national campaign on stigma and prejudice against those who have HIV, for work to increase testing uptake, and a proper look at its proposals on home testing. Finally, it requires a strategic vision for the future, beyond the respect and responsibility strategy.</p><p>In closing, I will say something about the global picture. This is an important moment and we have <place-holder colnum=\"12954\"/> a great opportunity. President-elect Obama&#8212;even before he has taken up office&#8212;has thrown out the irrational approach of abstinence-based programmes and the Bush Administration's refusal to fund condom provision and sexual health awareness-raising around the world. The Scottish Government has a long-standing commitment to international development. We must ensure that we, too, challenge those irrational approaches. There are still people in the world who would go through a country that has an HIV prevalence of 30 per cent or higher telling people that it is wrong to use condoms. Such an approach is not morally defensible and we should be willing to challenge it.</p><p>I join Marlyn Glen's call for a full debate on HIV in Scotland, not just in relation to public health, but in relation to education and international development.

She began her speech by calling for cross-party unity. If her motion remains unamended, I will certainly back it and I hope that the rest of the Parliament will, too.</p><p>Sarah Boyack and others, including Robin Harper, Stewart Stevenson, Alex Johnstone, Liam McArthur and Chris Harvie, have explained why the proposed measures are necessary. Chris Harvie is a freer spirit than most and he would be a worthy winner of that title if it goes his way tonight.</p><p>Few members and few people outside the Parliament doubt the urgency of the need to tackle climate change or the importance of consuming less energy if we are serious about achieving that target. In today's economic climate, it is clear that the best way of reducing energy consumption while saving households money is to implement programmes such as those that we are debating. Not only people who are technically in fuel poverty would benefit from that; households throughout Scotland would thank us for taking such action.</p><p>The only part of Sarah Boyack's speech with which I did not wholly agree was her description of the UK Government's track record in this area. I do not agree that it has been ambitious in tackling climate change. The ambition that is being demonstrated south of the border is attributable to local authorities, such as Kirklees Council, which are cracking on with programmes that are far more ambitious than anything that we are doing in Scotland, and are doing so with smaller budgets and less power than we have. There is no reason at all why we should not be able to match and outstrip their level of ambition.<place-holder colnum=\"12327\"/></p><p>A large part of Sarah Boyack's proposals relate to fiscal incentives. I will explain why incentives such as the council tax rebate are necessary but not sufficient. Of course, a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step, but on its own that step will not take us very far. If we want to achieve the scale of change that is necessary, we must remove all the barriers to uptake. The provision of a council tax rebate would certainly remove one barrier to uptake&#8212;it ticks that box. Planning changes would remove another barrier, which is great. Advice to households is good stuff, too. However, loan repayments are a huge barrier for householders, particularly at the moment, as are up-front costs. Another huge barrier is the hassle of getting energy efficiency work done. A geographically based, universal programme that is not means tested and which engages an entire local area at the same time would substantially remove the remaining barriers.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson reinforced the Government's frequently stated indications of intent to incorporate some of Sarah Boyack's proposals into the climate change bill but, disappointingly, there was little detail. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth has repeatedly told the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee that he has been considering not whether but how to integrate her proposals into the climate change bill. By this stage, we should be hearing more about the detail rather than about another delay in the bill's introduction.</p><p>Alex Johnstone explained how influential Sarah Boyack has been in helping to write the Conservative manifesto. That may not have been her intention at the time but I am sure that we are all in favour of sharing. He also focused on the win-wins. Energy efficiency is not just about climate change and fuel poverty; energy efficiency measures would be worth implementing even aside from those issues. The green-collar jobs that could be created from an energy efficiency programme will be necessary in the current economic climate.</p><p>Alex Johnstone also asked about the price tag. On infrastructure investment, we have a range of priorities. I might suggest that we repair the Forth bridge instead of building another one, which could save &#163;3.5 billon or &#163;4 billion.

Instead of having institutions that are too big for us to allow them to fail, we need institutions that are small enough to be able to fail without creating the problems for depositors and the wider public that so many people have experienced so painfully.

I agree with Sarah Boyack that the debate should not be about simply how much we care. Nevertheless, I could have an emotional attachment to a financial sector that was characterised by the values that I described in my opening speech. I am thinking of institutions such as the old Halifax Building Society, which began as a prudent building society that operated for the mutual benefit of local working people, and the Trustee Savings Bank, which was an aggregation of small savings banks that was run by trustees according to democratic and philanthropic principles. I could have an emotional attachment to that kind of financial sector&#8212;one that was not dominated by a few megabanks but was composed of many smaller institutions rooted in local communities.</p><p>As well as the emotional attachment, the here-and-now issue of jobs has characterised the debate. I apologise to Jamie Stone, who is just leaving the chamber, for not being able to take his intervention when he wanted to mention jobs in his constituency. Many communities, not just those in Edinburgh, are affected by the current situation. I argue that there could be not only more jobs, but more satisfying jobs in an alternative financial sector that was composed of smaller institutions rooted in communities and motivated by those communities' values.</p><p>John Park rightly talked about the need to work with representatives of the workforce. Those people are elected to advocate for their members' interests, so it is right that we should regard their views. However, there is another argument to make about democratic control of newly public assets. Alex Neil urged us to use such democratic control to protect jobs and nothing else. I agree with that as far as it goes, but we would serve Scotland's long-term interests better by ensuring that our banks&#8212;they are now, in large part, directly our banks&#8212;put sustainability, self-reliance and the community values that I mentioned ahead of executive pay and the interests of hedge funds and shareholders.</p><p>If the public are to own a substantial share of the banking sector, we should ensure that those assets work in our interests by shifting money away from the polluting technologies of the previous century and toward the renewables technologies of tomorrow. At a Sustainable Development Commission event last night, Ian Marchant argued that the financial crisis requires a specifically green investment-led recovery. James <place-holder colnum=\"11894\"/> Kelly's remarks in support of investment in microgeneration are quite compatible with that vision of a green-investment led recovery. Therefore, I fully expect Labour to support the Green Party's proposals on the budget that are designed to achieve just that.</p><p>We also need financial institutions to give priority to that agenda not only by shifting their investment, but by developing financial products that make it affordable for householders and businesses to retrofit their buildings. All that would mean that something far more substantial would emerge from the present disaster than simply the protection of existing jobs. The rebuilding of our economy could be based on those sensible values and provide a genuinely sustainable future for us all.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14186320", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Hbos"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Before I begin my winding-up speech, I cannot help but observe that it would have been nice if the member who lodged the   motion for debate had stayed in the chamber for longer than a few minutes at the beginning of the debate.

Tavish Scott is right to assert the need for debate. The concern about Scotland's economy and jobs is genuine and widely shared. The Greens share it too. Unlike Derek Brownlee, I do not feel the need to oppose the motion if it reaches the vote unamended, but to come to the Parliament merely to emote together without addressing the deeper causes of the financial crisis that we face is pointless. It amounts to little more than a group hug on the deck of the Titanic. It might feel like it helps a little bit, makes us feel a bit better and gives us some comfort in the short term, but it does nothing to change the problem that is at the heart of the crisis.</p><p>We can understand why the Government sees the need to bail out some of the major banks. Sadly, however, the bailout amounts to an attempt to refloat the same failed model of deregulated financial services that has been supported by all other political parties in this Parliament and at Westminster. Attempting to tweak and reboot the system that has crashed without finding out what went wrong in the first place simply will not cut it. However, the recognition is growing that reshaping our economy is as important for our financial system as for our society and environment.</p><p>The question at the heart of the matter is whether Government has the guts to challenge the perverse notion that growth is as essential as the air that we breathe and that we must aspire to unbridled economic growth. That notion is a fundamental flaw in the Scottish and UK Government approaches. Gordon Brown tried to encourage us to think that he had abolished boom and bust; what he meant was that he thought that he had abolished bust and could have boom for ever. The Scottish Government's central purpose&#8212;that is how it describes it, but I describe it as a central contradiction&#8212;of sustainable economic growth amounts to the same: more stuff for ever!</p><p>Growth is an exponential function and cannot be continued for ever without causing a collapse. The Prime Minister, the First Minister and others know <place-holder colnum=\"11881\"/> that their action in response to the current crisis is only a short-term solution&#8212;it aims to get everybody back to business as usual as soon as possible. The bottom line for both Administrations is that the demented pursuit of economic growth must be protected at all costs. In effect, the captain of the Titanic is trying to set sail for the next iceberg. If members regard the financial sector as the engine of the Scottish economy, that course of action should give no comfort to the people who work in the engine room. Tim Jackson, an adviser to the UK Government on sustainable development, wrote recently in the <em>New Scientist</em>:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"With the environmental situation reaching crisis point, however, it is time to stop pretending that mindlessly chasing economic growth is compatible with sustainability. ... Figuring out an alternative to this doomed model is now a priority before a global recession, an unstable climate, or a combination of the two forces itself upon us.\"</p><p>In his opening speech, Tavish Scott described a 300-year-old institution, but HBOS is not the same as the Bank of Scotland any more than Lloyds TSB is the same as the Trustee Savings Bank. Before the mergers&#8212;and, indeed, before the latest proposed merger&#8212;we had organisations that began as different beasts and operated on a more socially sustainable and socially just basis.</p><p>I do not have time to go into the detail of that argument and I think that members are familiar with it.

We are well used to hearing that&#8212;I note some of the speeches that Labour members have made. Far be it from me to suggest that the Labour Party in the west of Scotland would ever elect anybody useless under the first-past-the-post system. As well as being scathing about the use of proportional democracy, some members of the Scottish Affairs Committee remain cynical about the very existence of this Parliament.</p><p>Duncan McNeil opened this debate on a more balanced piece of work. Initially he used the term \"spoiled\" ballot papers, but it was important that he corrected himself part of the way through his speech, and started to refer to \"rejected\" ballot papers. We all understand what a spoiled ballot paper is. It implies an intention on the part of the voter to say, \"To heck with the lot of them\"&#8212;an understandable sentiment, sometimes. Many ballot papers were not spoiled; they were rejected by an imperfect system.</p><p>Consensus has built up around a number of areas in the debate, but others remain contested. I agree with Jamie Hepburn and the majority of MSPs, who have endorsed the idea that this Parliament should control the legislation governing <place-holder colnum=\"11660\"/> its own elections. The UK Government disagrees, however. Whichever position one takes on that question, we can all recognise that there are two Parliaments and two Governments involved, with three levels of government involved in the administration of the four sets of elections that we take part in. All of us, whatever our view on the balance in that involvement of the different Parliaments and Governments, should agree that there is a need for better administration. Whether that means having a single returning officer for Scotland or adopting the Electoral Commission's proposal for a management board&#8212;both those ideas have some merit and should be examined&#8212;we should agree on the principle that we wish there to be better administration. Whichever Government controls the elections to this Parliament, both Governments will continue to be involved, and the situation must be made clearer.</p><p>There is concern about electronic counting. I agree with James Kelly, who spoke about concerns over the system not being transparent. The system is not necessary, either; nor is it cheap and, after last year's elections, it is clearly not reliable. Bruce Crawford said that we should look for silver linings in last year's debacle, and I would regard the death of electronic counting as a silver lining.</p><p>There is clearly a will to ditch the highly dubious combined ballot paper. Constituency and regional elections are separate systems that elect different groups of people. Indeed, citizens who vote in the Glasgow regional election are perfectly entitled to elect someone who might be rejected by a particular Glasgow constituency. The proposal to drop the combined ballot paper in favour of having separate ballot papers is a good one. However, we should also consider randomising the order of candidates on the ballot paper and banning sloganising from it. I agree with the argument that no one should be listed on the ballot paper unless they are a candidate, which would prohibit the inclusion of wording such as \"Alex Salmond for First Minister\" and \"Convener Tommy Sheridan\". Only the candidates' names should be on the ballot paper.</p><p>The Conservatives proposed early in the previous parliamentary session that we should decouple the parliamentary and local elections, and I was happy to support that proposal. Decoupling would give greater clarity to the issues in local elections. However, the argument about turnout could cut both ways. I believe that a greater focus on local elections would help turnout to be not only high but meaningful.</p><p>The proposal to decouple the elections raises the issue of the electoral cycle. Aside from by-elections that arise from sad or exceptional circumstances&#8212;the overcanvassed residents of <place-holder colnum=\"11661\"/> Glasgow Baillieston experienced such a by-election recently&#8212;we have an almost continual electoral cycle. With local, national, UK and European Union elections, we have an election almost every year. Proposed elections to health boards and the possibility that Westminster may implement its decision to support an elected second chamber could add more layers of voter participation. That is a good thing rather than a bad one, and it is certainly not an argument against decoupling elections. However, there is a clear case for having fixed terms for all elections. For example, we could have a democratic event on the same day every year and make it a public holiday. Everybody could rely on that to know when an election was coming, and we could call it democracy day, or what you will.</p><p>If we all agree that the voters must be at the centre of the system, there should be a place for members of the public to take part directly in the decision-making process.</p>", "hdate": "2008-10-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "14138183", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Elections 2007"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "How infuriating that Des McNulty ended that speech with something&#8212;fixed terms&#8212;that I agree with him on.

I also thank the clerks: the team worked well and supported us not only in producing the report but in taking part in a series of events and visits around Scotland to explore the issues. Thanks are also due to the witnesses, to those who gave written evidence, to the ferry operators and to many others who we met on our travels around the country.</p><p>Ferries are a form of transport that many people in Scotland never or rarely encounter. I have to confess that before we began the inquiry, I was one of those people&#8212;dodging about between Glasgow and Edinburgh, I do not often find myself on a ferry. However, for those who rely on them daily as commuters, for people's family members and for local businesses their importance is difficult to overstate. When the economy of an area depends on ferries, we are expected to get right the policy as well as the services.</p><p>The committee was keen to hear as wide a range of views as possible. We conducted an online survey of ferry users, which was publicised in multilingual leaflets aboard ferries throughout Scotland. We received 330 responses and held full committee meetings in public in Oban and Lerwick. We also arranged a series of other committee meetings at which we took evidence from individuals and organisations that have an interest in the issue, and we had videoconferences with representatives from Orkney, Barra, Uist, Tiree and Stornoway, at which it was abundantly clear that those communities are far better versed in videoconference etiquette than the committee convener. We took part in informal fact-finding visits as well. Committee members visited Arran, Gourock, Dunoon and Mallaig to meet ferry users and operators. Our call for evidence received more than 110 responses.</p><p>The committee has come up with a series of recommendations, and I am pleased that the Scottish Government has chosen to accept several of them. That is an encouraging sign, and I <place-holder colnum=\"10616\"/> am sure that we will hear from the minister about that later in the debate. There are other areas where the Government is not yet persuaded of the strength of our recommendations&#8212;I am sure that we will also explore some of those issues.</p><p>To begin with, the committee considered some of the short-term measures that could be taken in advance of the Government's review&#8212;improvements that do not need to wait for the longer-term strategic thinking to be completed. I will run through some of those and then move on to the longer-term recommendations.</p><p>On short-term issues, there is scope to investigate whether more can be done to lengthen the sailing day and to maximise the use of vessels in order to allow greatest ease of commuting from the islands. We argue that Caledonian MacBrayne should investigate what can be done to improve that in the short term, and that the Government should investigate ways of speeding up the process of approving small and uncontroversial changes so that they can be implemented more quickly, and with less bureaucracy. We also argued that Calmac can investigate other forms of innovative working that could allow timetables to be improved.</p><p>On better integration with other transport modes, the committee has argued that operational flexibility could be built into contracts between the Scottish Government and both First ScotRail and CalMac ferries. We have also argued that the Government could establish a group under the auspices of Transport Scotland to ensure that operators regularly meet to discuss improvements. There is no reason why such work cannot begin in the short term.</p><p>On consultation, the committee has asked that the Government review how well the new ferry-user consultation arrangements have worked in practice. In evidence, we heard a wide range of views on the extent to which people believe that their opinions are being taken into account in the delivery of ferry services. Adjustments could be made to improve the lines of communication between operators and communities.</p><p>The committee argues that the Government's review has to treat accessibility as a priority, but we argue that even before that happens, work could be done to improve the pace of delivery, for both ferries and infrastructure, to bring them up to modern standards wherever possible.</p><p>On customer service, we have argued that the Scottish Government should instruct CalMac to make public how often it adopts ferry users' suggestions for improvements. That is a reasonable request; it would ensure that ferry users had some sense that their views were being heard. The Government should also instruct David <place-holder colnum=\"10617\"/> MacBrayne Ltd to review its customer service operations and to take into account how good practice in customer service can be shared between NorthLink Ferries and CalMac.</p><p>I will move on to some of the committee's longer-term recommendations. The first was that some of the immediate issues do not need to wait for the Government's review. We then moved on to argue that the specific timescale for completion of the review should be made clear. The Government should devote the necessary resources to guarantee the review's completion within a set timescale.</p><p>We have also argued that it is essential that the review be completed well in advance of the end of the current ferry contracts operated by NorthLink and CalMac. Several committee members detected no sense of Government urgency to move the review forward. Committee members felt that that should change. We also argued that the Government should take into account in its review the evidence that the committee received as part of the inquiry: I am glad that the Government has agreed to do that. We received a substantial body of evidence, which we hope will be of use in shaping the debate.</p><p>We have argued that the Government must fully assess the proposals that the committee identified for improving ferry services in the longer term. For example, there have been proposals on new, faster and more fuel-efficient vessels; on the use of a larger number of smaller ferries instead of a smaller number of larger ferries; on the use of catamarans; and on leasing arrangements. There is also scope for new routes&#8212;either through new routes being introduced or through existing routes being reconfigured. Such thinking should cover ideas of \"island bridge\" fixed links that some communities are talking about.</p><p>We recommend that the Scottish Government give full consideration to those and other ideas in its review. We have argued that many of the issues should be considered together and not on a piecemeal, issue by issue basis. The interconnection between them is unavoidable, so for a coherent overall strategy to be developed, the Government will have to examine all the ideas together.</p><p>We have argued that the review should outline how the Scottish Government proposes to address the constraints that have prevented delivery of improvements to ferry services. For example, any new flexible contracts must include appropriate safeguards for communities' lifeline services.</p><p>Recommendation 7 in our report is that a key feature of the Government's review should be an exercise to consider the transfer to a new maritime division of Transport Scotland responsibility for the <place-holder colnum=\"10618\"/> future strategic direction of ferry services, the development of gaps in the market, and the strategic management of the organisations involved. The Government's response describes it as being \"agnostic\" on the issue in the longer term. I must admit that I was a little disappointed by that cool response. The arguments in favour of the change were heard from a number of different sources and were well made. I hope that the minister can respond on that in more detail when he speaks in the debate.</p><p>Lastly, we have argued that a decision on the way forward for ferry services should be articulated in a single document, to be published following the review, and that that should be the subject of parliamentary debate, scrutiny by the committee and public input. The document must include full information on how proposals will be funded, the timescale for the implementation of changes and the body or bodies that will be charged with delivery of those changes.</p><p>I will address a couple of other issues on the road-equivalent tariff. It was unavoidable that a committee inquiry on ferries would include substantial discussion of the road-equivalent tariff, even at this early stage in the scheme. We recognise the fact that it is a pilot scheme that is in its initial stages. However, although we cannot comment on the effectiveness or the impact of the changes, several members of the committee were concerned about the views that were expressed regarding the possible impacts of the pilot scheme in various areas&#8212;different impacts in different parts of the country&#8212;and the capacity of the ferry services to support tourism, for example, in many parts of the country. We seek assurances from the Scottish Government that the planned evaluation will monitor those impacts. Further detail on how that evaluation will progress and the timescale for it would be useful.</p><p>We also need to recognise that a European process is under way to examine the competition issues. Although it is not possible for either the committee or the Government to pre-empt or second-guess that European process, we must recognise that it will have a substantial impact on how the debate moves forward. On balance, the committee does not believe that there is a need to restrict any input that the private sector may have in the future. Nevertheless, the Government review must include a full and genuine assessment of the opportunities that may exist in the light of the European process that is under way.</p><p>I look forward to the rest of the debate.

Some of the faces around <place-holder colnum=\"10386\"/> the chamber are in new jobs and 15 new bills are coming our way. However, some things are just the same as they were last year. The Government continues to strike a confident tone, but it is still a minority Government. It still needs to negotiate, co-operate and work with others if it wants to propose a programme. The Greens have been constructive but not uncritical in the past year and I am sure that that tone will continue.</p><p>One theme of today's debate has been hard economic times. Prices are rising and people are being hit in their pocket and their purse by the cost of living&#8212;the cost of food, energy and so on. It is recognised that that is due largely to the global economic pressures under which we all live. However, the First Minister introduced a paradox when he mentioned high and growing levels of life satisfaction&#8212;of happiness&#8212;in Scotland. Does that mean that no connection exists between the economy and wellbeing? Of course not. However, I argue that the connection is more complex than any Government has recognised.</p><p>More wealth for those who already have wealth does not increase happiness&#8212;that was the story of the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century&#8212;just as higher GDP for an economy is not a measure of progress or wellbeing for the population, yet the Government's purpose remains to increase growth and to fix single-mindedly on that one measure of economic progress. Given that and the growing acceptance that the global pressures under which I mentioned we live are not short term&#8212;they are not going away and are likely to worsen as the decades and the century roll on&#8212;we should reassess the fundamental purpose of Government.</p><p>In the past year, the SNP has brought clarity and focus to what it believes is the purpose of Government. It has brought greater clarity and sharper focus than its predecessors, but it has the same purpose&#8212;economic growth&#8212;which is the problem. The SNP calls it sustainable economic growth, but we hit up against the same basic problem: everlasting economic growth on a planet of finite resources cannot happen. That is the definition of unsustainability. Of course, that which is unsustainable will not be sustained.</p><p>How would making the purpose of Government sustainability rather than growth at any cost translate into a Government programme that was announced at the beginning of a parliamentary year? On energy prices, we would certainly do what Sarah Boyack argues for and remove the barriers&#8212;the inhibition and bureaucracy&#8212;that prevent people from adopting microgeneration and energy efficiency measures. We would go further and make huge public investment, which could turn high prices into an advantage for householders&#8212;into an income source rather than <place-holder colnum=\"10387\"/> a bill at the end of the month. We are constrained in regulating the energy market in some areas of power, but we could at least do what some of the best local authorities down south are doing. However, we are not even doing that. I urge the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth to consider what some of my colleagues in councils such as Kirklees Council are doing.</p><p>On the budget, the First Minister highlighted transport investments. However, with a sustainable vision, instead of spending billions on road building and more than &#163;4 billion on constructing one of the most expensive bridges in human history right next to where we already have a bridge, we would consider public transport, and not just infrastructure, but services and fares. Every morning, I take an overcrowded and uncomfortable bus service into town, which passes the route of the M74, where the Government is pursuing the same unsustainable road-building policy as its predecessors.</p><p>The First Minister was keen to suggest that council tax and local income tax are the only two options, but that is not the case. We need to look for a solution that offers social, environmental and economic benefits, in addition to greater fairness. Replacing an unfair tax with an unworkable tax will cause more misery than we can know.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis made some important points on small businesses, in relation to not only the immediate economic pressures but the longer-term issues of climate change and peak oil. The Green party would promote an enterprise policy that supports and focuses on small and local businesses. We need to transform our economy so that business is more sustainable. Localisation should be a key imperative of that.</p><p>I could not finish without saying something substantial on the climate change bill. As Robin Harper said, it is a welcome bill. It is coming later than we had hoped&#8212;perhaps in his closing speech the cabinet secretary will tell us about the timing. For example, by the time that Governments from around the world meet at Pozna&#324; for the next intergovernmental conference, will the Scottish Government be able to say that it has introduced its bill or will we have longer to wait? If indications are to be believed, the bill will be weaker than we had hoped. Because the SNP does not have a majority, I do not always give it a verbal kicking for changing policies and dropping manifesto pledges. It does not have the authority to implement all of its manifesto pledges and needs to work with others to form a majority. However, annual targets were SNP policy, Green party policy and Liberal policy. Further, every voice from the Labour Party that has spoken on the issue so far has called for annual targets. If that is the case, there is a majority and there is no excuse for changing the <place-holder colnum=\"10388\"/> policy.

I suspect that Des McNulty and many of his colleagues would agree. He talked about the cost of fuel and the changed relationship between central and local government as two new factors. It is right in new circumstances to look again at the regulatory environment, not just to enforce and apply it better, but to change it and truly achieve transformation in our transport system.</p><p>Des McNulty also talked about climate change&#8212;we all talk very well about that these days. We call for transformation in our energy system, in housing, in industry and in transport. However, we are not seeing the required transformation. We are seeing a wee bit of change in the right direction but sometimes, too, a wee bit of change in the wrong direction. Road traffic levels are still rising, so buses must be seen as more than merely a supplement to the car or a choice for people who do not own cars.</p><p>Alex Johnstone emphasised the fact&#8212;it is a fact&#8212;that competition has brought some improvements, which I accept. Those of us who advocate reregulation accept that. It is true, but it is insufficient because aside from the improvements, too many people are still putting up with expensive, dirty and unreliable services that are not designed to meet their needs. I continue to regard public transport as a public service: therefore even if-as they are in many cases&#8212;the services are operated by private companies, they should be designed and configured in the public's interests.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson made a general defence of the Government's policy. There is no great surprise in that; it is his job. He acknowledged the essential contribution that bus services make, but I did not get the feeling that he regards them as part of the public service ethos that I am trying to describe. He also said that buses could make a contribution to climate change, but I regret to say that as with almost every announcement on climate change from the SNP Government, there was no specificity about what will be achieved on climate change and how.</p><p>As for the minister's amendment, we all know what he is calling for when he says he wants the UK Government to take measures or to make a response to fuel price rises.

I had hoped that Sandra White would speak in the <place-holder colnum=\"9638\"/> debate&#8212;perhaps it was decided that no member who had signed the bill proposal should be called. I would be disappointed if that were the case.</p><p>Labour and the SNP should be natural supporters of stronger regulation of bus services.

I am not surprised that they extol the virtues of competition, but the reality&#8212;I hope that they can accept this&#8212;is that the impacts of competition are mixed. There is little doubt that in some areas competition has been beneficial, but there is equally little doubt that in many other areas competition has failed bus passengers and is still failing them.</p><p>The Conservative amendment places an emphasis on companies that are enjoying \"unparalleled global success\". I have no objection to Scottish companies enjoying success, but in this case the amendment seems to imply that the success of those companies should be an objective of transport policy&#8212;it should not. Good quality bus services at an affordable price should be the objective.

I congratulate myself on securing time for it.</p><p>To be serious, I was sitting in the seat behind Chris Harvie's just over a couple of years ago when the Greens introduced a debate on supermarkets, so I am delighted to participate in this debate, which pursues the same issue. At the time, we were slightly ridiculed for suggesting that supermarkets were in any way a bad thing. It is interesting to see how far they have come up the agenda and to hear the criticisms of supermarkets.</p><p>We can all list many criticisms, as several members have. Supermarkets have an impact on local retailers, such as those that Chris Harvie mentioned. I happened to be walking back to a train station through one of Scotland's high streets today and I was stopped in my tracks by the sight of what looked like a genuinely independent local baker, because that is so rare in high streets these days.</p><p>I am pretty lucky where I live, in Shawlands on the south side of Glasgow. A host of independent shops that sell not only food but other products survive there, but the supermarkets are encroaching&#8212;they are at one end of the street and are opening at the other, and little high-street mini-supermarkets are beginning to take over other space. Such developments are happening in many parts of Glasgow. Even this week, people in Partick are waiting with bated breath for the result of Tesco's appeal for yet another supermarket there. Partick is well served by supermarkets, and <place-holder colnum=\"8599\"/> the few independent retailers who hang on are threatened by the proposed development.</p><p>However, the impact of supermarkets is felt not only by local retailers, as there is a host of impacts on the environment. Supermarket bags have come up the waste agenda. Even though they form one small part of the waste stream, they are iconic, and many more people are aware of them.</p><p>I genuinely believe that supermarkets are structurally incapable of doing better at addressing localism and selling local food. They can have a bit of shelf space for a bit of local produce, but they will never fundamentally transform their way of operating, because they operate through national and global structures. They offer the deals that they have only because they operate on a huge scale; that cannot work on a local scale.</p><p>There are other reasons why we are beginning to cotton on to the problems of supermarkets. The price issue is a con. We spend more, not less, on our food as a result of supermarket offers. Some supermarket products are sold at cut-down cheap prices, but we spend more on processed foods and ready meals as a result of supermarket promotion. The choice issue is also a con, because when small retailers shut down, we lose that choice.</p><p>Above all, apart from all those impacts, supermarkets are just so damn soulless, in comparison with a real high street with real shops that sell real food.</p><p>The political response to supermarkets is inadequate. Competition law is failing us, principally because its purpose is to protect companies and to ensure strong competition between them rather than to protect people.</p><p>It is time to put supermarkets back in their box. They were initially supposed to be a useful supplement to a healthy and diverse local economy, but they are no longer that; they have become far too dominant. It is time to recapture our food culture from them. One good step forward would be for the Parliament never again to accept commercial sponsorship for an event, as happened at the session 3 ceremony last year, when bags with Asda adverts were given away. However, the issue goes far beyond that. We must recapture our food culture in a local way.</p><p>I thank Chris Harvie for the debate. I apologise that I cannot stay for all of it, but I appreciate the fact that he secured it.</p>", "hdate": "2008-05-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13658512", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Supermarkets (Economic and Social Impact)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank John Scott for giving me the credit for this fine debate, which I am happy to accept.

The advocates of local income tax could have made the case for fairness and listened to nothing else. The SNP could have stuck to its 3p rate and the Liberal Democrats could have defended local variability to the hilt.</p><p>The opponents of the local income tax&#8212;more accurately called the salary tax&#8212;in its various guises could have listed all the shortcomings as we see them. The Conservatives could have restated the case for cutting the rate for pensioners. The Labour Party could have continued its attack on the administration or competence of the salary tax, or it could have raised more questions about the impact on average earners or the amount of revenue that it would generate.</p><p>The Greens could have made another speech about the merits of the land value tax, which the Burt review&#8212;that review that somehow started gathering dust before it was even shelved&#8212;recognised. Every time we make a speech about the LVT, a majority seems to come together somehow and the chamber agrees that the idea shows promise and that we should fully investigate it. It never happens. The previous Government never made good on that promise, and the current one manages a less than impressive eight lines on the issue in its consultation.</p><p>So, we could have had that easy debate. Each of us could have set out our policy and defended our positions. The Greens could have taken the easiest possible approach and simply voted for the Labour motion, which rejects a local income tax but says nothing&#8212;not one word&#8212;about what should be done instead. How much further would that have taken us? Not a single step. Why? It is simply because the Parliament remains deeply and almost precisely evenly divided on the issue. There is no majority for a local income tax in the chamber, but there is no majority for the status quo either. Each party's colours are nailed firmly to its own particular mast and little room is left for dialogue. We appear to be at an impasse.</p><p>That is why we chose a different approach to this debate. If we were to agree a motion today that closed the door either to reform or to any element of property tax, Parliament would still be facing the same impasse. We would not have moved forward in any way. It is far better to <place-holder colnum=\"7623\"/> recognise our differences and agree some basis on which to resolve them. That is what my amendment does&#8212;it specifies the criteria that we should establish for a local taxation system.

It will be hard for the advocates of the salary tax to demonstrate how they can reduce tax avoidance, especially given that people at the wealthiest end of the spectrum would get away with paying nothing under the proposals. They will also find it hard to explain the economic advantages of the abolition of any element of property tax. It is a measure that, all things being equal, would be inflationary and would further distort the housing market and make it even harder for people to buy their first property. They will find it hard to point to any environmental benefits of such a tax, as it gives local authorities no facility to incentivise the efficient use of land. In case that seems to imply that LVT would get an easy ride, I am prepared to admit that we also have a hard job to persuade others that land value tax or site value rating can be made to ensure fairness for everybody.

I hope that the Government is willing to do that in the longer term.</p><p>I welcome the cabinet secretary's comments about the M74 and am pleased that the Government takes seriously the complaint about anti-competitive practices that has been lodged with the European Commission.

We will take no lectures from Mike Rumbles or any other Liberal Democrat about opposition to their road-building schemes.</p><p>Iain Gray spoke about the true romance between the SNP and the Conservative party and described their courtship behaviour in some detail.

His speech contained one grain of truth: our budget process is designed for majority government and is not properly designed to achieve what is in the interests of the population and public services of Scotland during a period of minority government. I hope that, even if no other grain of consensus emerges from the debate, all parties will be willing to consider and improve the process for the period of minority government that lies ahead.</p><p>We are where we are and we have the budget that we have. We must decide what to do about it. The Greens have taken a constructive approach, <place-holder colnum=\"5887\"/> as Greens in all European countries have done when we have had the opportunity to take part in parliamentary politics. As an early elected Swedish Green member of Parliament said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is better to take a few steps forward than to stand in one place screaming.\"</p><p>Tempting as it is, given the urgent problem of climate change and the consensus among every other political party on a road-building programme and aviation expansion, to stand up and scream how wrong members are, it is far more rewarding to argue for improvements in the budget, as we have done.</p><p>There have been improvements to the budget. We persuaded the Government to accept our arguments on scrapping aviation subsidies, on greater support for sustainable travel and bus services, on the climate challenge fund, on carbon accounting and on increased support for microrenewables and community generation. That is a substantial list of improvements. If Labour and the Liberal Democrats had taken such a constructive approach to the budget process&#8212;imperfect as it is&#8212;they would have seen more of their priorities being worked on in future.</p><p>Despite the improvements, we still do not have a green budget. The small wins that I listed are not enough to enable us to support the budget in the vote. We will not support it; but we will not seek to block it.

It should be clear that if we want the transport sector to pull its weight in the transformation that climate change demands, we must reverse that trend. If the sector does not pull its weight in moving towards the 80 per cent cut and we get, for example, only a 50 per cent cut from it, we will need a 90 per cent cut from the rest of the economy. That option is unacceptable.</p><p>We need to do more than express concern about the level of the BSOG; we need to make a clear call for a substantial increase, and my amendment does that, although only for 2008-09.

I thank those members who have stayed to participate and those who signed their name in support of the motion.</p><p>In recent years, environmental issues and climate change have come to the top of everyone's agenda. Political parties, businesses and the public sector recognise the issues, and they are beginning to be recognised by the education sector. Like any other part of the economy, educational institutions have an impact on the environment, which they can do a lot to reduce.</p><p>I will address Scottish issues in a moment, but across the United Kingdom, the higher education sector emits 3 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year and is responsible for about 1 million journeys every day. Schools emit about 9.3 million tonnes, with an additional 1 million tonnes emitted as a result of travel to school.</p><p>The education sector not only has a direct impact on environmental and sustainability issues; it can have an indirect effect by influencing the ideas, perceptions and attitudes of young people and more mature students who are in a learning environment. As a result, it is important to acknowledge instances in which students, such as those in the United Kingdom-wide People &amp; Planet campaign, act as leaders on these issues. That has long been the case. Indeed, 15 years ago, <place-holder colnum=\"5464\"/> when I was a student, it was the student leadership that prompted my university to attempt for the first time to examine its impact on environmental issues. I welcome the student leaders who join us today in the gallery and those who I know are watching the debate over the internet.</p><p>Their work is gaining recognition. In November, at the British environment and media awards, People &amp; Planet received the award for the best campaign of 2007. A large part of its work has been the creation of what it calls the green league, which provides comparative information about the environmental performance of the UK's academic institutions. The organisation aimed not only to applaud genuine progress by institutions that have taken steps in the right direction but to expose inaction by those that have not. It was felt that if such information was not made public, academic institutions would not feel any competitive spirit to improve their performance. Certainly I would like institutions to feel a competitive urge to get to the top of the league fastest or get themselves out of the lower ranks.</p><p>People &amp; Planet wanted to provide the information to give prospective students a choice. Although I sometimes feel that choice can creep in a little too much these days, nevertheless it can spark different reactions from institutions. In any case, students should have access to the information that they need to choose an academic institution that behaves in accordance with their values, ideas and aspirations.</p><p>What does the league have to say about Scottish institutions? Sadly, it shows that there is quite a bit of room for improvement. The league, which grades institutions as firsts, 2:1s, 2:2s, thirds and fails, has awarded firsts only to the University of Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews. They should be commended for their work to improve their performance; however, their overall score of 40 out of 50 is not perfect and we must encourage them to do more.</p><p>No Scottish institutions achieved a 2:1; three of them received 2:2s, and so must try harder; and the rest have poor environmental performance, failed or did not provide enough information to get a mark at all.</p><p>Obviously, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of course, such improvement can be achieved not only through student leadership but through organisational leadership. After all, it takes only one or two key people in an institution to be committed to driving these ideas forward to make all the difference.</p><p>What role can Government and Parliament play? Over the coming weeks, the Government and MSPs will have the opportunity not only to <place-holder colnum=\"5465\"/> support and raise the profile of the People &amp; Planet go green week, which will take place in February, but to ask academic institutions directly what they are doing to meet the campaign's aims.</p><p>In its campaign, People &amp; Planet is calling for four measures. First, it wants academic institutions to identify high-profile leaders from their senior management teams, such as vice-chancellors or principals, to provide active public support on these matters. Secondly, it calls on universities to have full-time staff who are dedicated to environmental management, to develop objectives, to set priorities and to establish time-bound targets for the fulfilment of those priorities. Thirdly, it calls on institutions to investigate all their environmental impacts through a comprehensive review, whereby current impacts are measured, potential improvements are identified and performance is monitored. People &amp; Planet's league has begun to assemble some of that information, but if the institutions carry out the work themselves, the position will be much easier to assess.</p><p>The fourth key measure that is advocated is the adoption of a written, publicly available environmental policy, which will provide a formal demonstration of intent on environmental performance and will enable us to compare practice.

There is merely time to point out that 100 per cent of people in Scotland outwith Gordon could have voted for Alex Salmond for First Minister, but if the people in Gordon had not elected him as their constituency MSP, he would not be here; that is why that is a problem. There is no time either to talk about the overnight count or the electronic counting, save to say that it is a grave mistake and one that we simply do not need to make. The Electoral Commission describes manual counting as 19<sup>th</sup> century technology&#8212;what nonsense. Doing things by hand is every-century technology, and it works.</p><p>There is no time, either, to go into the positions in the Conservative and Liberal amendments. I support the substance of both, however&#8212;the decoupling of the elections, and STV. I will cut all that and move directly to my rant about the Labour Party's position, which is a lot more fun than the rest of my speech anyway.</p><p>I suppose that much of the general substance of the Labour amendment is broadly okay. It is something that I might be able to accept rather than applaud and tolerate rather than celebrate. However, I have reservations about two aspects that seem to strike the wrong note. The first is the call for us to have regard to the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster. Now, I watched that committee. I was not that bored during the recess, <place-holder colnum=\"4992\"/> but I watched it earlier. I watched almost in disbelief as the committee rigorously grilled the Electoral Commission and gave an exceptionally easy ride to the UK Government, which the committee exists to scrutinise and which so grossly misused and bungled its powers of administration and legislation.</p><p>I watched in despair as Labour and Tory MPs joined in attacks on the principle of proportional representation, which was not criticised by Gould. I know that some Labour MPs at Westminster regard PR as a thorn in their side, but how dismal it would be if the 2007 election fiasco&#8212;for which Labour must accept a generous helping of blame&#8212;was used to promote regression to first past the post, which is the least representative and least pluralistic election system outside Cuba. We should be thankful that Scotland's democratic representation is no longer solely in the hands of such people. I would be happy to ignore that committee's views on the matter.</p><p>The second issue is the constitutional commission. I have no problem with the commission considering the matter&#8212;or indeed any other matter&#8212;but perhaps Mr Kerr should alert his colleague Mr Brown to the expectation that it will do that. When the Prime Minister was asked whether he supports the commission's work, he said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"This is a debate that has to be held at some point ... about accountability for money spent.\"</p><p>He seems to regard the commission as considering purely matters of financial accountability and not powers in any other area. If the UK Government or the three UK parties that initiated the commission want to pay for it, they can limit its work in any way, but if they want the Parliament to pay for it, it should be able to consider any matter.</p><p>I urge the Parliament to unite behind the principle of implementation of the Gould report's recommendations.</p>", "hdate": "2008-01-10", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13395562", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Gould Report"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Thank you, Presiding Officer.

Although I welcome the fact that the previous Administration was less than gung-ho on ID cards, I would not have given a simple endorsement of its position. At the time, Tom McCabe's commitments on ID cards were always just a wee bit hedged. I would not go so far as to say that he wanted to keep the door open to ID cards, but the commitments were generally on only the cards themselves. Compulsory ID cards are symbolic of the slow but relentless erosion of civil liberties that has taken place under the Labour Government at Westminster. However, beyond the cards, many campaigners have long argued&#8212;and I agree&#8212;that the real threat is from the national identity register, the database that will underpin the system. The motion shows an understanding of that, but the commitments that the previous Administration gave on the use of the database were always rather weaker than those that were asked for.</p><p>The position in Scotland on DNA retention is similarly open to criticism.

I draw members' attention to the briefing by NO2ID, which acknowledges that security is important, as mentioned in the motion. That issue is under a lot of discussion in the aftermath of the Government's gross negligence and incompetence in losing the personal data of 25 million people. However, there <place-holder colnum=\"4399\"/> are seven other important principles to remember. My other point is on citizen accounts, to which we must apply the same principles by which we condemn ID cards. There is a danger that we will end up with a system that looks more like an ID database than a bus pass database.</p><p>I agree with the Conservatives' criticism in their amendment of the cost of the ID card scheme&#8212;I welcome the defence of civil liberties from any part of the political spectrum.

We already lock up more people than most European countries do, and it would be wrong to reinforce that situation.

In talking about having constructive dialogue and <place-holder colnum=\"4167\"/> mature debate, she echoed Alex Salmond's words on the day that he formed a minority Government. It is funny that we can all strike that note when the circumstances require it but that we then descend back into skirmishes along the usual battle lines.</p><p>However, Labour's position contains contradictions. Wendy Alexander says that the SNP should not push its own agenda, but the remit of the proposed commission deliberately restricts its work and binds its hands, while calling it independent. If it were to be an independent commission, it would be given a free hand to consider all the options. If it were genuinely to seek to generate the broadest debate, it would be inherently inclusive. If it were genuinely to attempt to find common ground, it would welcome into its discussions every strand of political opinion.</p><p>There is another problem with the motion&#8212;the lack of any mention of a referendum. There is a well-established principle that major constitutional change should be put to the people for a vote. Beyond that, we should take care when we consider some of Wendy Alexander's comments. She said that the Parliament was a fitting tribute to the efforts of those who campaigned for it and that many people in Scotland take pride in it, but we should be careful not to overestimate the esteem in which the Parliament or, indeed, our entire political culture is held by the public. It would be wrong for Scotland's constitutional future to be determined by politicians alone or by commissions that we appoint. It should be determined by the people in a vote, which should include all the options. Those options should be clearly worked out in detail, which I am sure a commission such as the one that has been proposed could do.</p><p>I would have been happy to support the motion if it had incorporated slight changes along those lines but, sadly, it deliberately avoids being inclusive of all strands of political opinion. If such a commission is established following today's vote, I hope that it will work in a way that is more in keeping with the inclusive spirit of the Constitutional Convention.</p><p>There is nothing in the text of the SNP amendment that makes it impossible for me to support it, but I regret the fact that the SNP has not taken the opportunity to lodge an amendment that at least sought to elicit the support of all, even if that could not be achieved, rather than one that simply sets out its own stall. In such a debate, the right tone for the Government to have struck would have been for it to agree to the idea of a commission, albeit one that was genuinely independent and which had a free hand, even if such a proposal would have been rejected by other parties.</p><p>The initiative that we are discussing is the product of three political parties&#8212;the Labour <place-holder colnum=\"4168\"/> Party, the Tory party and the Liberal Democrats, which are the three main parties at Westminster. Those parties will need to make genuine efforts to make the initiative more inclusive and truly free from political control. If they do not, the perception will grow that it is not a Holyrood initiative at all but a Westminster initiative, which is taking place at the behest of&#8212;or at least with the consent of&#8212;leaders in London.</p><p>I note with regret that all three of the leaders of those parties who spoke in the debate have decided that they have more important things to do for the rest of the debate. Nicol Stephen said that he wanted the commission to have the widest possible support. That is the right tone to adopt. For example, there is no democratic mandate for federalism, but it would be quite wrong for any such commission to rule out that option before the debate has begun. The same should apply to other options.</p><p>Cathy Jamieson began her speech by talking about some of the problems that have beset Scotland. She mentioned poverty, disadvantage and ill health; to those I would be bound to add still-growing inequality, prejudice, environmental degradation and the harm that our lifestyles will inflict on the generations to come, whose representatives may sit in this chamber and curse our names for our inaction. All those issues and more are the responsibility of a Parliament and a Government but, sadly, the future of our constitutional powers seems to be debated only in the context of one objective of Government&#8212;economic growth. Leaving aside whether that should be an objective&#8212;my party is sceptical about that, although other parties believe that it should be&#8212;surely we agree that it is only one objective of Government.</p><p>My hope is that the debate about Scotland's future is broad, not only in participation but in vision. What kind of Scotland do we want? Do we want a Scotland that continues to permit growing inequality or one that places the health and cohesion of our communities on as high a pedestal as the one on which material wealth sits? Do we want a Scotland that continues to live unsustainably, storing up death for future generations, or a Scotland that challenges the culture of me, me, me; greed, greed, greed; and more, more, more&#8212;the culture of overconsumption?</p><p>Regardless of the text of the motion that is agreed today and whether we pursue the debate through a conversation, a commission, a referendum or an election, may the debate not be bound and blinkered by the narrow interests or prejudgments of today's generation of politicians of any party.

We could use the planning system to thwart the domination plans of the big four retailers, for example. We could use a serious approach to green procurement to direct some of the huge amounts of public spending outwith the central Government budget towards small businesses throughout Scotland. Some &#163;2 billion a year is spent by local authorities alone on procurement, and we could use that money to support small businesses, rather than just spending more from central Government's budget.

That is the end of my bridge building, and I turn to scrapping the unsustainable road-building projects that the Liberals and Labour set in motion and which, sadly, the SNP seems keen to stump up the cash for. As I said in relation to Derek Brownlee's amendment, those are matters for budget scrutiny.</p><p>What of the strategy itself? Mr Mather's management-speak may have crept in a little too much for my taste, but leaving that aside there is very little in the economic strategy that would be out of place in the expression of economic objectives of many Governments around the world. That, of course, is the problem.</p><p>We face unprecedented challenges, which derive from economic activity in developed, high-consumption countries such as ours. In the face of those challenges, business as usual is not good enough, and Greens would be as bland as the rest if we accepted the conventional thinking and chanted the mantra of everlasting economic growth. That came to mind during Iain Gray's speech, during which he mentioned EARL, the route development fund and the M74 extension; all three of those so-called \"iconic projects\" are designed to build capacity, either for increased <place-holder colnum=\"3594\"/> road traffic or for increased air traffic. It is no wonder that the Prime Minister is more interested in discussing the climate overseas with other world leaders than in taking the policy decisions at home that are necessary to cut emissions.</p><p>The issue comes up on page 20 of the Government's economic strategy, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Countries around the world are wrestling with how to break the link between economic growth and environmental impact.\"</p><p>Is it possible to break the link between economic growth and environmental impact? That is a tough question. Fortunately, I do not need to argue that it is possible; I argue that it is not necessary, because the link between economic growth and well-being has clearly been broken already. Since the 1960s, it has become increasingly clear that, once a society reaches a certain level of affluence, getting richer is not what makes us happier&#8212;growing more equal does. I commend the Government for at least writing in its strategy about social equity, inter-generational equity and the cohesion of communities, but that is all set in the context of growth&#8212;the myth that everlasting economic growth can be achieved on a planet of finite resources without something being torn apart at the seams.</p><p>When the SNP Cabinet positions were first announced, I was optimistic that there would be something new on well-being, given that it apparently forms half of the Deputy First Minister's agenda. However, we have not seen much on it so far&#8212;I await that with interest. The development of alternative economic indicators would be a good place to start.</p><p>My final point is on the process that has led to the publication of the strategy document. I have heard it rumoured that no strategic environmental assessment has been carried out on the strategy. I have even heard it said that some person from somewhere in the bowels of the Executive has given the absurd excuse that an assessment has not been conducted because the document is a financial plan and is therefore exempt under the legislation. It is clear that the document is not a financial plan&#8212;it is an economic strategy, which is why the words \"economic strategy\" appear on the front cover.</p><p>I hope that the cabinet secretary will explain, in closing, when the strategic environmental assessment will be published.

It is not entirely as I would wish it either, but it is entirely in order. We discussed with Cathy Peattie, the deputy convener, who supports the bill, whether she might stand in today; however, she is away on sick leave this week. If the member is interested in how I intend to manage this feat, I suggest that she simply watch and listen.<place-holder colnum=\"3497\"/></p><p>There are some difficulties in this scenario. I am a convener in a minority of one, but the vast bulk of the report was agreed unanimously. The majority of the recommendations in the report had the support of the entire committee, and I will spend the bulk of my speech reflecting the consensus view of the committee on the majority of the bill. After that&#8212;if I can be indulged just a few words at the end of my speech&#8212;I will talk about why complete consensus was impossible to achieve.</p><p>Our first task was to consider the toll impact study and to find out whether the Government accepted its findings. In one of our most significant early conclusions, we found a wide body of support for the toll impact study and a suggestion that it represents the best state of knowledge that we can have about the likely impacts of the bill. We found that the study is factually sound and that there is a general consensus that it presents a reliable account of the impact of the abolition of the tolls on the two bridges. In questioning the minister, it appeared&#8212;although he was sometimes less than 100 per cent explicit about this&#8212;that the Government accepted the findings of fact in the toll impact study.</p><p>After considering the impacts, we recommended that the Government should provide funding for any remedial or mitigating measures that might be identified as necessary to address negative environmental impacts. Although the Government has responded, that response consists mostly of commitments to \"continue to monitor\" and to \"give consideration to\", and other such open-ended commitments. It seems reasonable, given that the findings of fact of the toll impact study have been accepted&#8212;at least, it is implied that they are accepted by Government&#8212;that the Government should have something a bit more coherent and positive to say about what it intends to do, based on the expectation that the toll impact study's findings will come to pass.</p><p>We asked the Government to explain what it intends to do to ensure that it honours its commitment to keep road traffic across the Forth at 2006 levels and to decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, given the likely impact of an additional 9,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per annum. The minister answered that that is</p><p class=\"indent\">\"outwith the scope of the Bill.\"</p><p>However, the committee would not have agreed its conclusions on those matters if it did not regard them as being very much part of the context of the bill.</p><p>Of course, the commitment to long-term targets for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is welcome. The whole chamber will look forward to debating that. Nevertheless, it is a long-term target and we were <place-holder colnum=\"3498\"/> looking for something about what the Government intends to do in the immediate future to ensure that its policy on emissions and traffic levels is achieved. There does not appear to be anything clear in the minister's response about what impact each of the measures will have. The minister mentioned buses, rail, travel planning, eco-driving&#8212;the phrase almost makes me gag but I have said it&#8212;green fleet reviews and active travel, but there seems to be no clear expectation of what impact those measures will have. If those measures are being planned, and if the minister has some confidence in the predictions about traffic levels and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, he should be able to tell the chamber what impact those measures will have on traffic levels and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p>We commented on the need to fund additional traffic management measures as a result of removing the tolls. We had a clear explanation of how the toll plaza currently manages traffic at busy times by merging multiple lanes of traffic so that it can pass safely across the bridge, and a clear indication that whatever traffic management system replaces the plaza will have some of the same physical consequences for traffic going on to the bridge.</p><p>We argued for further commitments on bus priority measures and sustainable transport initiatives. I am a little sorry that, although the minister mentioned bus priority measures in his response, he said nothing about sustainable transport. I particularly mention the evidence that the committee received from Spokes, the cycle campaign, which described the experience of getting across the bridge and into Edinburgh. The minister told the committee that there is a very nice cycle lane on the bridge, which would be fine if all one wanted to do was cycle back and forth across the bridge, but most people want go somewhere when they get off the bridge. The cycle route is described as:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Completely inadequate cycleroute - too narrow, poor surfacing.\"</p><p>Another person said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"this is one of the poorest parts of the route\"</p><p>and someone else stated:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"It is a national disgrace that it is allowed to continue.\"</p><p>It would be good if the minister said what the Government intends to do to achieve the shift towards sustainable transport for which we all hope.</p><p>Finally, equity is the basis on which the Government has made its argument. It is clear that the Government's current transport policy objectives are connectivity, public transport, reducing emissions and shortening journey times. <place-holder colnum=\"3499\"/></p><p>Those are the transport strategy's objectives and the Government says that it intends to honour them.</p><p>At one point, the committee agreed that equity should not in general be a transport policy objective. We heard very sound evidence that it would be difficult to build in such an objective. In this instance, the majority of the committee agreed that equity should be argued for and other members will no doubt explain that at length. We were not able to reach full consensus because, in my view, if equity was to be a serious transport objective for Government, we would be looking for the greatest equity, which is equity for public transport users who have been fleeced for decades, and many disabled passengers who are still physically locked out of much of the transport network. That is where the greatest inequity lies in the transport system. If the Government were genuinely proposing equity as a transport objective, that is where it would begin.</p>", "hdate": "2007-11-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13392192", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am sorry that the member finds it awkward.

It has not, so we should scrap it and I am glad that that will happen, although it will take some time to come about.</p><p>I am also glad that there are moves to improve energy efficiency and to increase the fund for microrenewables, which so often ran dry under the previous Administration. I welcome the provision for a climate challenge fund and a few other measures, such as the commitments to making agriculture, housing and energy use lower-carbon areas of the economy.</p><p>However, all that is pretty small beer&#8212;although it is a step or two in the right direction compared with the previous lot.

I will hear no lectures on commitments to motorway building from Des McNulty or any other member of the previous Administration. The commitment on climate change is barely more than the Government spends on administration.</p><p>I echo some of the comments that Jackie Baillie made on housing. On the surface, there will be modest increases in the housing budget over the full three years of the spending review period&#8212;most of us understand that the first year is bound to be tighter. However, it is already being made clear that in the first year there will be a 6 per cent cut in the housing budget and there is no specific commitment on social rented housing. The organisations that Jackie Baillie cited say that the budget will fail spectacularly to provide the 30,000 new rented homes by 2011 for which they have been campaigning. It is also important to reflect on the fact that increases in the housing budget in subsequent years will not be enough to keep up with land prices.</p><p>Parties will always have a go at one another in the chamber over promises that have been made and the reality of minority Government.

We were conscious that it was a bold, clear, radical, public health measure that would have an impact. In considering the various proposals on alcohol&#8212;there are lots of them, and some of them are minor&#8212;with which most of us agree, I find myself worrying that none of us yet knows which ones might work and how well they might work. If there is a radical public health measure for alcohol that is politically acceptable, I am not sure that I have yet heard it. However, there are some ideas in the Government's motion and in the amendments, so I will be happy to support them even if I might have liked them to go further.</p><p>There is no getting away from the fact that some aspects of the problem are urgent and widespread&#8212;but they are not new. Binge, underage and excessive drinking, or drinking to get drunk, were not invented in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but there are new aspects to the problem. What are they? There have been trends in the industry during recent decades&#8212;I would say specifically since the 1960s&#8212;that were conscious, deliberate and designed to increase consumption without regard to their impact on health or society. New products were introduced, such as lager in the 1960s, to replace drinks that took longer to drink. More lager can be consumed in a certain amount of time, and so more can be sold over the bar. Such products also changed the tone and culture of pubs; they brought in a younger generation who could be more easily encouraged to drink more substantial amounts more quickly.</p><p>Since then, other products have been introduced&#8212;pre-mixed drinks, alcopops and other sweetened and flavoured drinks&#8212;that were designed to promote unhealthy consumption. Changes in the pub and retail industry have also brought about the same effect, whether we are talking about mega-pubs, which have fast <place-holder colnum=\"2776\"/> employee turnover, poor training and fewer social connections between the buyers and sellers of drink, or whether we are talking about supermarkets. I have argued much the same case about the big four supermarkets over a range of areas in which they overuse their market dominance.</p><p>Kenny MacAskill said that alcohol is not like any other product; I argue that, too often, the industry is regulated much like any other industry.</p><p>Alcohol is a legal recreational drug that I enjoy myself and I would not want to say anything that could be misinterpreted as being puritanical. I cannot help but recall the stage 3 debate on the Licensing (Scotland) Bill, in which I perceived something of a&#8212;no doubt unintentional&#8212;judgmental undertone. After all the calls for national restrictions on opening hours, irrespective of local knowledge or circumstances, and all the expressions of concern about impacts on communities having too much access to alcohol, we trooped downstairs to the huge trays of wine that awaited us at that evening's reception.</p><p>I do not think that anyone intended to be contradictory or hypocritical, and I would not want to make such accusations, but we have created around us a working environment that promotes unhealthy drinking. Only very rarely on a Tuesday, Wednesday or sometimes Thursday evening does a glass in this building go without being refilled.</p><p>We need to resolve the tension between public health priorities set by the Government and personal freedom. That will not be easy in this case. We could do it with the smoking ban because that was about recognising the freedom of non-smokers, but such a measure does not exist in relation to alcohol.</p><p>If we are going to restrict anyone's freedom, we should begin with the industry that has up to now exercised its own freedom without any reference to public health.</p>", "hdate": "2007-10-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13390286", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Alcohol"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "There has been a degree of consensus in today's debate, as there is in the motion and the amendments.

I congratulate any member for persistence, but Mike Rumbles will know that I cannot welcome the terms of his motion. It refers to the economic importance of the AWPR project, which I believe has been overstated, as was the economic importance of the previous major road project that his party pushed through&#8212;the M74 extension, in respect of which figures for predicted jobs were more or less pulled out of the air.</p><p>Regardless of any supposed benefits that the AWPR will bring, it is clear that levels of traffic will continue to rise and that economic benefits will be lost over time. It should be clear to anybody that congestion harms the economy and that it is a function of too much traffic, rather than a function of a lack of roads. The motion says nothing&#8212;not a word&#8212;about the environmental impact of the AWPR scheme, which will be increased road miles and road journeys, and more CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. It has been suggested that there will be a 7 per cent increase in emissions. There will be mixed impacts locally from pollution; some areas may benefit in the short term, but potentially serious increased local pollution will affect a number of schools close to the route.</p><p>On the public local inquiry and the First Minister's commitments on that, I suppose that it is no surprise that a member of the Liberal Democrats wants to ensure that ministers can continue to ignore utterly the recommendations of a PLI, given that his colleagues happily threw out the report on the M74 extension and pushed through that monstrosity of a road project. Members of the public do not have the resources to represent themselves at PLIs that developers and local authorities have. If we expect them to put their time, effort and money into the PLI process, it is important that they trust it. However, there is a perception that not only for the AWPR project but for many similar ones, the PLI is just another form of tick-box consultation, particularly given the political commitments that were made before the beginning of the process.</p><p>The AWPR project was originally costed at &#163;120 million, but the current projection is for &#163;295 million to &#163;395 million&#8212;none of the figures is realistic. If Mike Rumbles is right that the only alternative to PFI is further delay, the costs will continue to spiral no matter what. Given the average cost of building a mile of motorway&#8212;I think that we are talking about something like &#163;16.2 million&#8212;and the amount of money that has already been committed, I suggest that a &#163;600 million price tag for the project is much more realistic.

Is this just <place-holder colnum=\"2149\"/> another example of general taxpayers subsidising the roads lobby while politicians mouth platitudes about public transport, modal shift, sustainable development and climate change?

It is entirely worth our while to consider the process of the inquiry without necessarily getting into the rightness or wrongness of the project.</p><p>Just as Murdo Fraser made the case that prior assumptions had been built into the inquiry, I will begin with an assumption of my own: I believe that few people&#8212;there are some, certainly&#8212;who object in principle to the development of onshore wind in Scotland, although I understand their concerns. On this day, on which we had a first informal meeting of MSPs to discuss the need for a cross-party group on climate change to ramp up debate on this most urgent of issues that face humanity, I believe that it is worth our while to reflect on the process of change that has led both the people and the political parties both to come to such agreement. My assumption is that many objectors are reasonable people who seek not to prevent the development of renewables in Scotland, but instead to reduce the impact of such developments on people and the environment.</p><p>All members have in front of them a copy of the minister's conclusions on the legal submissions that were lodged recently. The conclusions argue that the terms of the inquiry and the various types of evidence do not need to be reconsidered. In legal terms, the ministers might well be right about that, but a question remains about whether that should be the case. Regardless of the differing views that people might have on the need for the upgrade, reasonable people who have engaged in the process and who have often spent a great deal of their own time, effort and money in doing so, should be able to expect a reasonable process.</p><p>Is the public local inquiry process reasonable? I can refer only to my experience as a witness at the public local inquiry on the M74. The overwhelming sense was of the huge imbalance between the resources of objectors and the resources of developers and local authorities. It was an intimidating process; I had been fairly intimated by being elected as an MSP a couple of months beforehand, but the process of giving evidence to the public inquiry for the first time was even worse than standing in the chamber. A degree of political bias was also built in&#8212;three <place-holder colnum=\"1900\"/> days before the inquiry began the then First Minister had made a commitment in Parliament to build the road. The terms of the inquiry were also restricted. Given all those factors, it is amazing that we won and it is rather disappointing that ministers ignored the successful conclusions of the inquiry. I do not recall Conservative members or members of any of the other political parties that are represented in the chamber expressing a great deal of support for the objections that we raised and the motions that we lodged at the time. If we are debating the fairness of the process, rather than the merits of the project, perhaps other parties should review their positions on the M74 public local inquiry.</p><p>There will always be controversy surrounding major infrastructure projects. We will never get a process that makes everyone happy with the outcome. However, both sides&#8212;developers and objectors&#8212;should welcome the fairest, most rigorous, most comprehensive and most thorough process possible, because such a process is most likely to persuade those on the losing side, whichever that happens to be, to accept an unpalatable result.</p><p>I understand that ministers do not want to reopen the debate on planning legislation, but they have flexibility in the work that they are still doing on the regulations that result from it. Will they reconsider the idea of records of inquiries, either written or video records? The latter might be cheaper. Will they look again at the health and social factors that could be included in planning decisions, and at the idea of health impact assessments?

Most members are wrong pretty much all the time, and I will be entirely even handed with my constructive criticism.</p><p>It might have been convenient and happy for the Parliament and all political parties if the electorate, in their wisdom, had given us a Parliament that had a clear view on the council tax. However, the arithmetic is on a knife edge: half the Parliament wants a local income tax, but half believes that some form of property tax is an important principle and must remain.</p><p>Let us consider the arguments that we have heard on local income tax. First, I will examine its relationship to the ability to pay. The idea of a progressive taxation system in which what one pays relates to what one has is clearly an important principle. However, it is not limited to salaries and can relate to any form of taxation. It is an important principle across the taxation system as a whole, not in relation to one, specific tax.</p><p>It seemed to me that Tavish Scott's arguments on the ability to pay could almost be used against resource taxes, which the Liberal Democrats <place-holder colnum=\"987\"/> describe as green taxes. Considered individually, resource taxes can appear regressive but, if they are used carefully within an overall progressive system, they can be fair. Similar arguments apply to value added tax.</p><p>The other argument for a local income tax is the perception of unfairness that surrounds the council tax&#8212;Bob Doris referred to detestation and anger. The sense of unfairness has increased in proportion to the steady increase in council tax levels. We need to take account of that. We need to respond to that sense and recognise that, just as there is no majority in the Parliament for a local income tax, there is no majority for the status quo either.</p><p>However, those arguments can be made for other forms of tax, not only council tax or income tax. Let us examine the arguments for some form of property tax. One of the Burt review's conclusions was:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Property taxes are better suited for use as a local tax than income tax. They are difficult to avoid and suitable for collection locally. They are certain ... they are not susceptible to sudden reductions.\"</p><p>Des McNulty argued that a genuinely fair system takes account of assets and income. People should remember that both are forms of wealth. Reducing the scope of the taxation system as a whole by taking asset wealth out of the equation altogether would only make it easier for people who so desire to avoid paying tax. Even without that deliberate avoidance, under a salary tax&#8212;that is what we are talking about with a local income tax&#8212;many of the very wealthiest would pay nothing at all.</p><p>Robin Harper has talked at length about the benefits of land value tax as not only a fairer but an environmentally and economically better form of local taxation. It would not only help to bring disused land back into economic use and stimulate the economy, but would also help to dampen down some of the problems with the housing market. By contrast, removing any form of property tax would be an inflationary measure.</p><p>I recall to members' minds the motion for which the Parliament voted in 2003, agreeing to further investigation into</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the contribution that land value taxation could make to the cultural, economic, environmental and democratic renaissance of Scotland.\"</p><p>The Parliament voted for that. The Scottish National Party voted for it and, if I am to be open to the arguments that it is making today, I need to hear some willingness from the SNP Government to act on that commitment and undertake that investigation.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13385513", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Council Tax"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I am delighted to close on the Green amendment.

I am sorry that he has just left the chamber, because he made a thought-provoking speech that I was glad to hear.</p><p>There is general global debate about what role market-based mechanisms can have in tackling climate change. For Governments, emissions trading is the main expression of that idea. Among many individuals and businesses, to whom such trading mechanisms do not directly apply, the idea of voluntary offsetting has gained some popularity. They want to do the right thing. That is, of course, to be welcomed, but the question is whether the Government should not only endorse that approach, but initiate its own offsetting policies.</p><p>I echo Des McNulty's comments on that. If we accept the concept of offsetting&#8212;as many politicians from a number parties do&#8212;there can only be a case for using it in relation to so-called housekeeping emissions to offset or attempt to offset a particular journey or the total emissions from running a conference or major event. The arguments about offsetting infrastructure projects are very different from those on offsetting housekeeping emissions.</p><p>Robin Harper compared commercial offsetting to papal indulgences or even fig-leaves. He talked about good reasons for many international development measures and domestic tree planting but made it clear that such measures cannot, in themselves, simply be totted up and offset against polluting practices and policies or used as an <place-holder colnum=\"752\"/> excuse for continuing such practices and policies elsewhere. Jim Hume also spelled out the difference between burning ancient carbon&#8212;the carbon cycle of which is on a timescale of geological time&#8212;and replacing it with tree planting, which is on a short carbon cycle.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson was one of many members who talked about the importance of climate change as an issue that faces the world. I welcome the commitment to the climate change bill. I look forward to the statement next week and to seeing the contents of the bill when it arrives, but I question the stated intention of attempting to offset transport infrastructure projects. I hope that my questions are constructive and I look forward to receiving the answers to them, because the intention to offset is an implicit acceptance that those infrastructure projects are not sustainable.</p><p>I also express a little disappointment that Stewart Stevenson stated that he would have to take a domestic flight. I do not accept that there is a case for flying on this small island in any except life or death circumstances and for essential island connections, which are the only option for some people. I regret that his visit to see Mr Miliband will leave him in a position comparable to Nicol Stephen's after his urgent and necessary trip to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards last year.</p><p>I also echo a lot of what Sarah Boyack said. She laid out a clear case for a truly sustainable transport policy and advanced many arguments with which I agree, not least on the Edinburgh tram system and the Glasgow crossrail.</p><p>Richard Baker mentioned the Aberdeen crossrail. I reassure him that I am no more nervous about criticising the unsustainable transport policies of my SNP colleagues than I am about criticising those of the Labour Party, not least the Edinburgh airport rail link. We are critical of that project because we regard its business case as being predicated on a further dramatic expansion of aviation and because it will have to compete for passengers with the trams, which risks undermining the case for not only building but completing the tram network, which would serve the whole city, not only airport passengers.</p><p>We also disagree with all the other parties on major road building projects. I find myself unable to support either the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrat amendments. Those parties have supported projects such as the M74 extension and have simply pointed to a few green-thread policies as an excuse for pursuing unsustainable transport policies. For them to use phrases such as \"sustainable transport\" is the political equivalent of offsetting. They have their green threads so that they can carry on with business as usual.<place-holder colnum=\"753\"/></p><p>Alex Johnstone mentioned Mr Cameron's offsetting habit. I cannot agree with that, but I am glad that Alex Johnstone entered into the debate properly and acknowledged the concerns that many people have about offsetting. His amendment detracts nothing and adds a little, so we can support it.</p><p>Alison McInnes said that climate change needs a much wider debate. I agree and hope that she agrees that this debate takes nothing away from that. We need to debate offsetting in advance of the Government introducing its climate change bill and proposals on offsetting&#8212;if that is what happens&#8212;not least because of the limitations that she mentioned in relation to offsetting. We initiated the debate not because we are overly concerned about the text of a motion or an amendment, but because we have a general concern about the concept of offsetting.</p><p>I recommend that members look at the website cheatneutral.com, which urges people who feel the need to be unfaithful to their partners to fund somebody else to be faithful as a way of offsetting the amount of pain and unhappiness that they are generating in the world. It urges people to think about how to reduce their unfaithfulness to sustainable levels first. It is satire, of course, but it makes the point about what offsetting really is.</p>", "hdate": "2007-06-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13384991", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Carbon Offsetting"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We initiated the debate as the beginning of a discussion about this complex issue and I am grateful to all members who have engaged constructively in that conversation, not least Nigel Don.

We have discussed the cost of the system, which affects Scottish devolved services. The cost of Trident has an impact on the amount of money left to spend on other priorities, on many of which people in Scotland would prefer money to be spent.</p><p>We have debated the strategic decision and whether replacing Britain's nuclear weapons system at this time would influence other countries to seek to acquire nuclear weapons. We have debated the hypocrisy of a country that has waged war on other countries over allegations of weapons of mass destruction and has pursued sanctions against such countries for wanting those weapons. We have debated the role of deterrence and whether the original strategic idea behind the possession of weapons of mass destruction is in any way relevant to the modern world or whether that argument died with the cold war.</p><p>We have debated the importance to local areas of the jobs associated with Trident. We have considered how many jobs really rely on Trident and how the areas in question might seek economic diversification.</p><p>We have debated the United Kingdom's international responsibilities under the non-proliferation treaty and the requirement on us to work towards disarmament. We have heard the former Labour First Minister recount his personal journey from unilateralism to multilateralism, which I believe he spoke about sincerely. However, multilateral disarmament is still disarmament. Those of us who argue against the deployment of a new generation of submarines and, ultimately, of nuclear weapons make the case that replacement <place-holder colnum=\"701\"/> fails even the multilateralist cause because it amounts to unilateral rearmament.</p><p>Just about every argument for and against the replacement of Trident has been heard in the Parliament, but three things have happened since the Parliament's most recent debate, six months ago, on the issue.</p><p>First, in January, an opinion poll carried out by ICM for the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament found that almost two thirds of Scots opposed the plan to replace Trident. That figure rose to 73 per cent if the price tag was set at &#163;50 billion, which some people consider a conservative estimate.</p><p>Secondly, on 14 March, a clear majority of Scottish MPs at Westminster voted against the Government's proposals: 33 Scottish MPs were against them, including a majority of Labour members, 22 were in favour of them, and there were four abstentions.</p><p>Thirdly, in May the numbers in this Parliament changed. I believe that a clear majority of members here also oppose the UK Government's proposals. It is clear that there is a range of views within that majority. Some members, including me, many Labour Party members&#8212;I am sure that Elaine Smith comes into that category&#8212;most Scottish National Party members, some Liberal Democrat members and perhaps even some Conservative members, are strongly opposed to the idea of replacing Trident at all. Other members qualify that, by reference either to multilateralism or to delaying a decision.</p><p>A majority of MSPs oppose the current proposals and although I share Elaine Smith's regret that her amendment was not selected, its selection would not have altered the decision at the end of today.

There is a great deal to take in in a short time, so it is impossible to respond to everything in the report. I welcome the fact that John Swinney responded immediately by restating the commitment not to mutualise Scottish Water, which is one of the recommendations in the report. Several political parties agree with that manifesto commitment. Mutualisation would in practice be privatisation in key regards. I do not believe that most Scots would find that in keeping with their priorities or find it acceptable.</p><p>I agree with Margo MacDonald and Alex Neil that in this session Parliament will have to get its teeth into the issue of powers. Even the Howat report uses language such as the \"evolution of devolution\". It would be bizarre and almost perverse if Parliament, after an election in which many people voted for change, was unable or unwilling to touch the issue of powers.</p><p>The Howat report's comments on the nature of a partnership agreement could be regarded as a harsh critique of the specific partnership agreement that was in place in the previous parliamentary session. However, more reasonably, it is a discussion of the problems inherent in any partnership agreement formed by a coalition. The report offers a series of options for helping to solve such problems.</p><p>What surprised me, though, is that in a report that sets such store by the quality of forward thinking in government there appears to be no discussion at all of the different set of problems that would arise and solutions that would be required if we eventually arrived at the situation in which we now find ourselves. We have a Government that does not command a legislative majority in Parliament and that cannot produce a partnership agreement or a programme for government that it can implement.</p><p>If a partnership agreement is seen as a mixed bag of commitments&#8212;general and specific, costed and uncosted&#8212;that lead to a lack of focus or <place-holder colnum=\"168\"/> consistency and which causes problems for an Executive's budget, how much more complicated a situation are we now in? We do not even have the policies and legislation that are to be put in place over the next few years in the one bag yet, let alone a more consistent set of priorities or policies than those we saw in the previous parliamentary session. That is not an insurmountable problem, but it is a different problem. It is a new situation, which poses new challenges and requires new thinking.</p><p>Minority government means that some power has shifted from the Executive to the Parliament and that will be healthy. Legislative changes made by MSPs in parliamentary committees and in the chamber will have an impact on the Executive's budget. A majority Executive can be reasonably sure that, broadly speaking, its programme will be put in place, which means that Parliament can hold ministers to account for the consequences&#8212;we can hold them responsible for all the consequences. However, none of that holds now.</p><p>The question of how Parliament as a whole will exercise responsibility and take informed decisions, given that the civil service works only for the minority Executive, will arise in this session. The answers that we come up with may well come to be regarded as a precedent for minority Governments well into the future. The approach to government is therefore a question not only for the Government, but for us all.</p><p>Ministerial remits have been referred to. Initially, I shared Malcolm Chisholm's concerns about the possibility that the equalities agenda might move from the communities portfolio to justice. I believed that if that happened there would be a danger of an overly legislative focus developing in the equalities agenda. Social attitudes&#8212;the whole hearts and minds agenda&#8212;are crucially important to equalities policies. I was pleased therefore that that portfolio change did not take place and that equalities will stay in the communities portfolio. I think that that was an early indication that the Executive is willing to take on board concerns and rethink its plans.</p><p>Several members referred to the crucial issue of environmental remits. On one level, the more ministers who have an explicit responsibility for environment and climate change, the better. I would like to see them all have that explicit responsibility. However, on another level, there is a clear need to join the dots between cause and effect. The previous Scottish Executive sent some ministers out into the wider world to champion the cause of climate change and bang the drum on it, while other ministers pursued unsustainable policies, notably on economic growth and transport.<place-holder colnum=\"169\"/></p><p>I may have as many criticisms of the SNP's transport policies as I did of those of the previous Executive, but at least now there is one cabinet secretary and ministerial team who are accountable for both cause and effect.

A country of the size and scale of Scotland can more easily achieve the fundamental change that is necessary to develop sustainably for the future by acting for itself on the widest range of issues. It can more effectively advocate for global justice by acting for itself on the world stage. That is my position and the Green position, but I want to examine the other parties' positions.</p><p>The Executive's motion&#8212;after its false start&#8212;now highlights the fact that Labour and the Liberal Democrats have different views. That is all well and good. For me, the most difficult aspect of the motion is the assertion that the majority of Scots are against independence. We have seen polls one way and polls the other way, but the question has never been put to the vote. We have never given all Scots an opportunity to engage in a debate on that issue alone and to put an X in a box to state their preference. Why are the Executive parties against giving people that opportunity? Because, they say, more constitutional wrangling would produce conflict and chaos.</p><p>Let us remember that Labour's suggestion that any Executive that sought to open a dialogue with Westminster about reserved issues would bring about conflict and chaos came in the same week that its Minister for Education and Young People, in a very welcome intervention, added his voice to the general outcry against the dawn raids that families in Glasgow are living in fear of. Mr Henry finds it possible to engage with London on a reserved matter, calling for a change to UK asylum policy, and the Executive has done so on other issues as well. However, we are asked to believe that any future Executive that did the same thing and engaged with London on reserved issues would spark off conflict and chaos. I find that to be a difficulty with the Labour position.</p><p>The Conservative amendment seeks to restore the motion to its original form. I do not believe that that is due to the Conservative team suffering from the same clerical problems as the Executive team; I think that the Conservatives are making a different point.

Sadly, however, I cannot agree that the bill as it stands will achieve those aims or put those principles into practice.</p><p>Prison can and must be used to protect the public from some dangerous offenders, but it can do so only if the time spent inside is used properly, by challenging behaviour, supporting recovery from addiction, teaching basic skills and encouraging better attitudes. If we do those things, we will release people who are less likely to reoffend. But we do not do those things. We pack ever more offenders, including those who are not a threat to the public, into ever more overstretched and overburdened prisons, thus reducing the scope for meaningful work with offenders during their time in custody. We often release them in an even more damaged state than when they went in. As a result, reoffending rates continue to be unacceptable. If we do not reduce prisoners' chances of reoffending, we protect nobody.</p><p>Bill Aitken gave a particular example, but I do not believe that sending even a petty repeat shoplifter to prison protects the shopkeeper unless the time the offender spends in prison reduces the likelihood of their reoffending when they come out. If that does not happen, a short prison sentence is <place-holder colnum=\"33332\"/> worth little in the way of deterrence, little in the way of rehabilitation and little in the way of public protection. If a sentence is not worth those things, what is it for?</p><p>It is possible to express differences of opinion on this subject without accusing one another either of not caring about victims or of being on the side of criminals. In this morning's session, and again during First Minister's question time, there was a little too much of that uncomfortable \"tough on crime\" rhetoric, which helps nobody. Whoever feels that they are winning the \"tough on crime\" trophy always ends up accusing those who disagree of being on the side of the criminals. We can do a little better than that.</p><p>In reality, the interests of victims and criminals are not opposites. Giving offenders the best chance of changing their lives and offering them the greatest support to overcome addiction and other problems is the way in which we can prevent the creation of more victims in the future.</p><p>Despite the good principles behind much of the bill and despite my support for some of its aspects, such as those relating to the sale of weapons, I find myself struggling to justify support for it. The bill could have damaging consequences not only for the overstretched prison system but for criminal justice social work services. The Executive tells us not to worry, as it can build more prisons. That is exactly the kind of predict-and-provide mentality that still holds sway in its transport policy&#8212;\"Too much congestion? We'll build more roads.\" I fear that custodial sentences will eventually result in filling up whatever space we make available and that we will be back in this chamber at some point asking why rehabilitation is not having the desired effect.</p><p>If we had passed amendment 44, in the name of Colin Fox, I would have found the bill more palatable. As it is, I am unable to support it.

The bill does not specify what kind of anonymised systems should be put in place, but it is clear that many schools, in seeking to fulfil the duty, will opt for biometric systems, which are already in place in some schools for a range of purposes. It is clear that there will be an increase&#8212;possibly a substantial one&#8212;in the use of biometric systems.</p><p>In the Communities Committee at stage 2 and before that in the Parliament, I raised questions about how the systems ought to operate. I feel instinctively that biometric systems are probably unnecessary and not very welcome in schools, but if schools decide that they want to go along that route, that is well and good and we should consider how the systems will operate. The principles that I asked about were on issues such as parental consent and whether biometric data would be kept centrally in a database or on site in schools' local systems.</p><p>I have raised a range of issues, but the crucial one is parental consent. The Executive has said repeatedly that parental consent is an essential prerequisite if schools are to collect biometric data. However, having probed that a little further, it seems that consent is in no way essential and is not really a prerequisite. Instead, it seems to be an optional extra&#8212;it is regarded as a matter of good practice for schools to obtain parental consent before they take children's fingerprints. To me, that is not enough, which is why I suggested at stage 2 that we write into legislation a requirement on schools to obtain parental consent. The Communities Committee and the Executive took the opposite view.</p><p>Another approach that I suggested was that ministers should issue guidance on how biometric systems ought to operate and what the boundaries should be for their use. Again, I was not successful in persuading the committee on that. My suggestion at stage 3 is that we take a smaller step in the same direction: I am asking for a code <place-holder colnum=\"33092\"/> of conduct, which, unlike regulations, would not be binding, although it would give a clear steer from the Executive on issues such as parental consent.</p><p>The minister might be able to answer a question that I asked at stage 2 and to which I did not receive an answer. The British Educational Communications and Technology Agency is currently working on guidance for United Kingdom ministers on how biometric systems will operate in schools and the boundaries for them. Will the minister say whether those guidelines will apply in Scotland and, if not, whether the Executive is minded to produce guidelines, in which case there would perhaps be room for negotiation or compromise? However, if no such guidelines are being worked on in Scotland, it is reasonable to ask the Executive to produce a code of conduct, which is what amendment 27 does.</p><p>I move amendment 27.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13381566", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 8 &#8212; Protection of identity of pupils receiving free school lunches"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Section 8 will place a duty on local authorities to introduce anonymised systems to protect the identity of pupils who receive free school lunches.

It is therefore right for us to have the debate even just one more time.</p><p>The two issues that I think the minister needs to address are the contradictions in the Executive's position for which I find no explanation. The first is the fact that there is universal provision of free school breakfasts, snacks and fruit but an absolute prohibition on the same approach being taken to lunches simply because they are served in the middle of the day. I cannot find any explanation in any of the minister's statements in the <em>Official Reports</em> of our stage 1 and stage 2 proceedings that clarifies why a fundamentally different approach must be written into law simply because food is served at a particular time of day. The only explanation that I can conceive of is that the Executive's approach is based on cost alone.</p><p>The second contradiction that I still cannot get my head round is that it is now accepted that food in schools is not merely an optional extra but an integral part of the education experience. Food in schools is about teaching children to have a healthier relationship with food that will serve them well for the rest of their lives. Why should lunch be the one aspect of children's education experience that is not provided for universally?</p><p>I understand the targeting argument&#8212;that we should target our resources on those who most need them&#8212;but why does that not apply to the provision of jotters in schools?

However, I struggled to find any information about issues such as credit unions and the debt arrangement scheme on the Scottish Executive's website. Indeed, after 10 minutes of searching, I found only one reference to illegal moneylending, so it might be useful if more information were to be made available not just to members, but to the public.</p><p>In his opening speech, Des McNulty defined loan sharks as people who lure unwary borrowers into easy credit. He mentioned exorbitant interest rates and appalling practices involving harassment and violence, and highlighted the consequences of unmanageable debt. He also talked about how &#163;250 might be borrowed to pay off an unexpected debt. That led me to recall Scott Barrie's members' business debate last night, which touched on Scottish Power's back-charging of prepayment meters. The &#163;250 that is borrowed to pay off that kind of debt can easily spark off a spiral of debt that can go out of control; in some cases, that &#163;250 might become a four or even five-figure debt within a short space of time.</p><p>I am very happy to answer Des McNulty's call and join in his condemnation of illegal moneylenders. I welcome the Executive's support of credit unions and its work on financial <place-holder colnum=\"32626\"/> education, money advice and mechanisms to help people to manage their debt better. Indeed, I am sure that there is a broad welcome across the chamber for many of those measures. Moreover, I am keen to hear more about the task force pilots, which no doubt have a role to play.</p><p>However, I want to highlight two further issues, the first of which is the unhealthy trend towards the general social acceptability of substantial amounts of debt through the enormous mortgages that some have taken on, through credit cards, or through loans from illegal or legal moneylenders.</p><p>The SNP amendment touches on the second issue that I want to raise, which relates to legal moneylending. Although we should certainly join in condemning illegal moneylenders, we should recognise that they are only one part of the problem. Irresponsible legal moneylending is at least as much of a problem. For example, all the criticisms that Des McNulty made of illegal moneylending could equally be levelled at the so-called subprime lending sector.</p><p>Provident Financial is perhaps the best-known UK example of a company that provides such credit. Its pitch of providing immediate, no-questions-asked cash on the doorstep is specifically targeted at low-income households, and very often leads to repayments that are nothing short of extortionate. One single mother who borrowed &#163;200 was required to pay back &#163;300 over 30 weeks. When she got into trouble with the payments, the same agent immediately offered her a second loan of &#163;500 to settle the debt and cover some additional expenses. The interest on that loan, which was to be paid over 54 weeks, amounted to &#163;310. Again, difficulties arose, and a loan of &#163;1,000 was offered, which was to be paid back over 54 weeks at interest rates equating to about 170 per cent. The debt spiralled and spiralled until, at the end of the year, it had reached more than &#163;7,000, an amount that the woman had no realistic prospect of repaying.</p><p>The subprime lending sector and its huge profits are in no way subject to the same kind of criminal penalties and sanctions that Des McNulty outlined and which we would all support for the illegal sector. Indeed, far from it. The UK Government has simply not addressed the problem of legal providers and predators&#8212;and I reinforce the point that, in this instance, I am talking not about the Glasgow Housing Association, but about subprime credit providers, who are free under legislation to continue to do very nicely, thanks very much, out of people's poverty.</p><p>In that context, I commend to members the New Economics Foundation's publication, \"Profiting from Poverty: Why debt is big business in Britain\", which recommends a cap on the interest rates that can be charged on such loans. That measure, <place-holder colnum=\"32627\"/> which echoes Trish Godman's proposal, is already in place in several European countries and should be considered.</p><p>At the moment, shared legal actions against companies are not permitted in this country. However, there is a wide range of reasons why we should be open to the idea of class actions and of enabling borrowers to make joint complaints against companies such as subprime lenders.</p><p>Finally, it does not make sense that while the rest of the financial services sector pays for its own regulation, the public sector pays for the regulation of credit. In effect, that amounts to state subsidy of the credit industry.</p><p>Members have mentioned many other proposals with regard to credit unions and have highlighted a range of other measures on which communities and the public sector can work together to address the problems. However, I am forced to agree with much of the tone of the SNP's amendment, which does not, as Jamie Stone seemed to imply, hang on the idea of independence. Those who support or oppose independence can have that disagreement, but no matter whether we believe in devolution or federalism, we need to resolve the current split in which we have responsibility for debt issues but not for credit issues. Even if members want devolution to continue instead of choosing another option that some of us support, we should at least re-examine the area.</p>", "hdate": "2007-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13380267", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Illegal Moneylenders"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.

I am not sure whether he is influential, timely or prescient, but it is a welcome debate and Scott Barrie is to be thanked for bringing it to Parliament.</p><p>In addition to the energywatch briefing that Scott Barrie mentioned, I was pleased to see that we received briefings from a number of other organisations, including Barnardo's and Capability Scotland, which want Parliament to understand the impact that energy debt has on a range of different people in diverse family situations.</p><p>Energy debt needs to be considered in the context of other debt issues in our society. I think that we are seeing an unhealthy trend towards social acceptability of large amounts of debt, whether it be the immense mortgages that some people are taking on or other forms of debt such as credit cards and student debt. There are also issues with illegal lending&#8212;which we will debate tomorrow&#8212;and, indeed, legal lending, which is often quite predatory. That trend is bad for our society and our economy as well as for the individuals concerned, who are often among the most vulnerable individuals in our society.</p><p>Energy suppliers will always have a problem with billing systems for the most vulnerable people, but some of their practices, as Scott Barrie mentioned, hit the poorest households and families hardest. For example, the fact that prepayment meters have a different tariff is an issue and some providers have been unwilling to write off the debt that has accrued when there has been a delay in resetting meters. As Scott Barrie rightly pointed out, people accept a prepayment meter partly because of the expectation that they will pay their bills as they go along and will not be hit with a bill for a single lump sum. It is entirely right that a cross-party group of MSPs joined Jackie Baillie in a delegation to Scottish Power on that issue&#8212;I am sure that Jackie Baillie will mention that.</p><p>In the case of Scottish Power's practices, what has shocked me most is that, although the company's representatives spoke with us civilly and were quite willing to meet us to discuss the issue, they had not even calculated what it would cost Scottish Power to change the policy by writing off such debt. I suspect that the cost would be a drop in the ocean for Scottish Power, but it would <place-holder colnum=\"32595\"/> be very significant for many families. I urge Scottish Power to reconsider the matter.</p><p>Energy debt will continue to be a problem because it is a consequence not only of fuel poverty but of price fluctuations. Price fluctuations will not go away. All suppliers must ensure that the most vulnerable people are not placed in the situation of having an ever-greater debt burden. The role of politicians is not just to engage with suppliers on the issue but to look at public policy. Scott Barrie explained the historical situation in terms of the welfare state but, as we move further into the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the job for politicians is to prepare all citizens and households in Scotland for the period after cheap energy. Cheap energy belongs to a period in human history that is over. Whether we use fossil fuels&#8212;which are fast dwindling&#8212;or the mineral fuels such as uranium that will fuel any new nuclear power plants that might be built, those fuels will dwindle and run out, so energy prices will continue to fluctuate and energy debt will continue to be a problem.</p><p>It falls on all suppliers, including Scottish Power, to adjust their systems to ensure that the most vulnerable people are not placed in further debt.</p>", "hdate": "2007-02-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13380251", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Energy Debt"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Scott Barrie began by mentioning the recent slight reduction in prices.

The reality is probably somewhere in between, but we should all acknowledge that steps have been taken.</p><p>The Executive and the Parliament should be proud of the homelessness legislation that has been put in place. The Executive certainly cannot be accused of ignoring housing issues, as it has repeatedly come to the Parliament with proposed legislation on housing issues. Throughout that process, the issue of resources has been raised in relation to support services, which have been mentioned, and to new build. However, it is not reasonable to accuse the Executive of ignoring the issues.</p><p>Across the political spectrum, there is now more understanding of and support for the principles of affordable housing, including those on affordable social rented housing and mixed communities, than was perhaps the case in the past, although understanding has not quite reached everybody. I remember asking one Glasgow housing developer whether there was an affordable element in a housing development on which he was working. \"Absolutely,\" he said, \"You would be surprised. Some of them will go for less than &#163;200,000.\" Someone was missing the point, and I do not think it was me.</p><p>I put on record my support for the Executive's homestake initiative. If people want to get on to the property ladder, buy a house and feel a sense of ownership, but property prices are out of their league, a case can be made that they should be able to get into the market one step at a time, which is what the homestake initiative lets them do. I would like the open-market version of homestake to be rolled out. Ministers should accept that although helping 1,000 households is a good start, it is only a start. If the initiatives are taken further, we are in danger of stalling on other progress that we have made. I hope that members of the Executive parties acknowledge that if we handle the homestake initiative wrongly, we run the risk of damaging further the status of rented <place-holder colnum=\"32467\"/> housing. It is a shame if social rented housing is seen as the option of last resort, as though it is an inferior kind of housing. It does not need to be perceived in that way.</p><p>I do not agree with everything the Scottish National Party says about stock transfer, but it is absolutely right that we must talk about the issue. It was a mistake for the minister to open the debate without saying anything about that.

That is part of the purpose of LGBT history month.</p><p>One of the last things that I did in my previous job was to create an historical timeline exercise for youth workers, helping to train them on supporting young people coming out. I found references from as early as 8,000 BC right up to the present day, spanning the world's cultural diversity from ancient references, within the world's oldest known written story of Gilgamesh for instance, to examples in the Chinese and Indian cultures, the Greeks&#8212;naturally&#8212;and the beginnings of formalised legal oppression in Europe's middle ages.</p><p>In this year when we mark 300 years since the Act of Union, I will risk mentioning King James VI of Scotland and I of England. James, who commissioned what we now call the authorised version of the Bible and to whom it is dedicated, is one of those characters whose sexuality has not always been recognised by historians. However, it <place-holder colnum=\"31397\"/> was remarked at the time of his accession to the English throne that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Elizabeth was King: now James is Queen\".</p><p>It was also noted with some scorn by one writer that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The love the King showed men was amorously conveyed as if he had mistaken their sex and thought them ladies, which I have seen Somerset and Buckingham labour to resemble in the effeminateness of their dressings\".</p><p>The crudeness of that description obscures the human feelings involved. By the end of James's life, he spoke of his love for George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, in terms of marriage&#8212;centuries before civil partnership:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I desire only to live in this world for your sake ... I had rather live banished in any part of the earth with you, than live a sorrowful widow's life without you\".</p><p>In more recent times we have seen the hypocrisy that masqueraded as Victorian morality and the celebration and condemnation of Oscar Wilde&#8212;a moment when same-sex love dared to speak its name and was brutally punished for doing so. We have seen the beginnings of the emancipation movement, particularly in pre-war Germany, and eventually we saw decriminalisation in the United Kingdom after the Wolfenden report, although more than 20 years passed between its publication and decriminalisation reaching Scotland. Now, we see the steady erosion of the swathes of discriminatory legislation and practice in society. That has been driven partly by the legislators and partly by the activists inspired by events such as the Stonewall riot&#8212;a response to the police raids that were still occasionally known in this country even in the 1990s.</p><p>We have come far&#8212;further than many would have predicted even a few decades ago&#8212;but have we reached equality? Even if we have, it does not quite count as the end of this history. I remember using the timeline exercise that I mentioned with a group of LGBT young people who were shocked and puzzled at the concept that their sexuality could ever have been a criminal offence. At the time, I could not decide whether it was good that they were growing up without that concept in their heads. On balance, I would say that it is good, but young people have a right to learn about it in the context of history.</p><p>I remember my shock on learning about the liberation of the concentration camps at the end of the second world war. The hair stood up on the back of my neck when I learned that, when the camps were finally liberated, the few homosexuals still left alive were rounded up by the allies and re-imprisoned. It was shocking, but is it more shocking that I was never told? All school students learn something about the horror of the Nazi persecution and mass murder in the middle of the <place-holder colnum=\"31398\"/> previous century, but very few learn about that fact. Such airbrushing of history&#8212;deleting or ignoring aspects of people's lives or even of major world events&#8212;diminishes history for us all. That is why we have a programme of events around Scotland for LGBT history month. If history has been airbrushed and if events and people have been left unrecorded, we should remember the words of Oscar Wilde:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it.\"</p><p>I am pleased to acknowledge that the Scottish Executive supports the programme of events. I am pleased, too, that many members have stayed to debate it with us. The Parliament has also made its mark on LGBT history in Scotland, repealing section 2A before the rest of the UK repealed section 28 and in so doing facing down those who wished to turn their prejudice into one of the first major battles of devolution.</p><p>That has been the story in more recent years. With every step forward that we have taken towards a society that is more at ease with its own healthy and natural diversity, a small but vocal group has sought to cling to every last shred of discrimination and prejudice, as I am sorry to say is happening again down south even as we speak.</p><p>It is greatly to be welcomed that political leaders across the spectrum in all parties are now committed to equality for all in society. That does not mean that there is no more work to do. There is more work to do, such as making good on promises to outlaw hate crime, for example, which many people had hoped the Executive would do in this parliamentary session.</p><p>I hope that, if members take away nothing else, they will take away a mental note to return to their parties and examine the commitments that are being made for the coming election, to ensure that the next session of the Scottish Parliament continues to make history for LGBT communities in Scotland.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13376942", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History Month"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank the 30 or so members who added their names in support of the motion.

I hope that the Conservatives will not oppose the general principles of the bill. Even in Conservative terms David Davidson is wrong. If the Executive's bill was telling parents what they were allowed to feed their children at home, he would have a much more valid civil liberties argument.</p><p>When we first received the bill, I, like Dave Petrie, asked myself whether we really needed legislation. I considered the evidence of hungry for success and wondered whether we needed a bill. I concluded that the bill is good and that it will improve not only what is happening in schools but what is happening in children and young people's wider lives, including their family lives.</p><p>I will talk briefly about the health promotion aspects of the bill. When taking evidence, the Communities Committee heard a gargantuan phrase&#8212;the obesogenic environment. Young people in that environment, even when they take rational decisions, find that conditions such as obesity are more likely to occur. Making health promotion a core function of schools is taking a step in the right direction away from the obesogenic society.</p><p>Our ambition to give young people a healthy environment should not end at the school gate. The bill does what it can in the context of schools, but I would argue that in the next session of Parliament we should look beyond the school gate and consider ways of making a fundamental shift towards a healthier society for young people outside of school as well.</p><p>On the issue of nutritional standards, the bill gives us an opportunity to shift the philosophy. Food should not be regarded merely as the feeding of children; it should be regarded as part of the education of children. Food in schools should be part of the educational experience. As I think Jamie Stone said, children should be aware of where food comes from. They should know about the farming in Scotland that helps to feed them. Such awareness will stay with them for life. Children should also learn about how food can assist them in their health and in their academic attainment. The opportunity that the bill gives us to make that philosophical shift breaks the link that David Davidson sees, with food being a parental responsibility and education being the school's responsibility. The food that is provided in schools should be seen as part of the educational experience and I can see no reason why it should be paid for differently.</p><p>We have heard about the contradiction between the universal free provision of breakfast, water and fruit and the lack of such provision for lunch. The bill says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The authority may&#8212;<place-holder colnum=\"31350\"/></p><p>(a) provide any food or drink free of charge, or</p><p class=\"indent\">(b) charge pupils for any food or drink.\"</p><p>That applies to anything outside of lunch&#8212;for anything that cannot be called lunch, there is local flexibility. Let us explore the minister's argument. The central point is to do with targeting. We have a certain amount of resources&#8212;where do we target them? Why should the taxpayer pay for a free lunch for the child of an education minister, a successful architect or a general practitioner? If that is the argument that is being used, why does it not also apply to free breakfasts? Why should a taxpayer pay for the free breakfast of the child of a rich family? I would argue that we should be paying for free breakfasts and for free lunches, because there are some things for which society is better off if it provides them collectively. Education is one of them. Given that food in schools should be seen as part of education, I would say that the same argument applies to it.</p><p>The Executive's approach with respect to poverty is to focus on stigma. It seeks to remove any distinction by producing anonymous systems. I think that we should remove any such distinction by removing the distinction between who is entitled to free school meals and who is not. The proposed anonymous systems give me cause for concern, partly because they address a problem that exists only in some people's perceptions. The evidence that the committee heard did not show clearly that stigma is a problem for young people&#8212;or indeed for teachers. The evidence suggests that some parents perceive it to be a problem, at least for other people. However, I am not convinced that there is strong evidence to suggest that young people themselves feel it to be a problem. The young people whom I have asked about it in schools have had a very mature attitude to the issue.</p><p>As I said, I have concerns about the anonymous systems that the Executive wishes to introduce. Some of them might be unnecessary and some of them might lead to the introduction of technological systems such as swipe cards and fingerprinting. There are longer-term worries. If we are teaching children to put it on the plastic, I worry that we might pay the price in consumer debt in 20 years' time. If we are teaching children that biometric systems are a normal and natural thing in society, I worry about the civil liberties implications.</p><p>I will close by speaking about the draft nutritional standards and the draft regulations. I think that they place too much emphasis on a narrow approach to nutrient levels, with nothing on artificial additives or the sustainable procurement and freshness issues that the Soil Association has discussed so articulately while promoting them in schools in Ayrshire in particular.<place-holder colnum=\"31351\"/></p><p>I hope that there will be some improvements to the bill, but the Greens will certainly support its passage this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2007-01-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13376790", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I cannot help expressing a little disappointment at David   Davidson's speech.

However, in today's debate about trial in the absence of the accused, the Conservatives took the biscuit&#8212;if I may mix my food metaphors&#8212;in accusing the bill of overturning the fundamental principle of the right to a fair trial. That is pushing it a bit. I am the first to agree that accused people&#8212;who are innocent in the eyes of the law until proven guilty&#8212;have clear rights that cannot be shirked. Nevertheless, the approach in the bill, which focuses on what is in the interests of justice, seems proportionate.

We are also possibly heading towards a situation in which we imprison a higher proportion of our population than any other European country. It should, therefore, be clearer than ever that simply locking people up for longer does not make society feel safer or make society safer in reality. I worry that, a few years down the line, in reconsidering the issue, we will find that bail offences have continued and that we have simply added to the overstretching of the prison system, making the situation worse.</p><p>I have little to add to my general welcome for the bill and my one expression of concern over an issue that will perhaps be for the next Parliament to consider in the coming years.

Many such parents would downplay the contribution that they make by emphasising that adoption is a rewarding experience. I am sure that that is the case, but many adoptive parents take on a very challenging experience. We should be proud to associate ourselves with the contribution that they, and all those who work to support them, make to our society.

My response to that is that, at one time, challenging racism and sexism was not an easy thing to do.

I am a great supporter of the principle that we should all vote according to our conscience all the time. I certainly do not think that members should in any way be disciplined or frowned upon for voting or speaking according to their conscience. That is an important principle. How would members feel if discrimination and prejudice against their family was given greater dispensation? That is what is implied when it is said that votes on issues such as Roseanna Cunningham's amendments should be treated as votes of conscience, in some higher regard than any other vote that we have in this chamber.</p><p>We have a bill that I hope all members will be able to support.

He framed that distinction largely in economic terms. Without wanting to take away from the importance of the economic aspects of Derek Brownlee's argument, I am sure that he will agree that there is such a thing as society. I regret that the Conservative amendment seems to imply that the Executive's duties do not apply or relate to social or cultural factors. Like the Executive's amendment, the Conservative amendment removes the issues about how young people are perceived. That is to be regretted.</p><p>Fiona Hyslop cited Ewan Aitken, who has spoken about the danger of young people being turned into hate figures. I very much agree that none of us wishes to ignore the harm that is done through antisocial behaviour. I think that Fiona Hyslop understands our argument that, if young people continue to be perceived as not being welcome on our streets and not feeling part of society, the problem is likely to become worse, not better.</p><p>Frances Curran&#8212;albeit at a slightly higher pitch than I personally find comfortable&#8212;spoke about the funding problems for community groups, <place-holder colnum=\"28538\"/> activities and facilities. As an adult in Glasgow with some money to spend and with access to transport to the city centre, I have a choice of a myriad things to do and places to go. If I did not have that choice, I think that I might behave quite badly sometimes.</p><p>Stewart Stevenson spoke about children as victims, and I agree with that. I would add that, when discussing issues around bad behaviour and crime, as politicians we all sometimes ignore the nuances and imagine that there is some rigid distinction between victims and offenders. That is not always so; it is not always cut and dried. I have been both, and I think that many other people have been both. Sometimes, we forget that important aspect.</p><p>I return to Scott Barrie's comments. He seemed to imply that bringing the problem of negative perceptions and stereotypes of young people for debate&#8212;like Labour's think-tank, the IPPR, has done&#8212;is somehow to create or reinforce the problem. He went on to focus on family support services, which was much more welcome. Referring to Mary Mulligan's contribution, I would like more of the Executive's contributions in this area to focus on the improvements that could be made if we were able properly to fund such services.</p><p>The last speaker I will mention is Paul Martin. I am sure that he will enjoy reading the Scottish Green Party's manifesto for 2003 much more closely and noting that it mentions policies relating to children on seven occasions and policies relating to young people on six occasions. If he wants, we could sit down with a cup of coffee later and I could point those out to him.</p><p>Would the Executive view success in terms of working with people&#8212;COSLA used those terms in <em>The Herald</em> today&#8212;rather than merely counting the number of orders that are passed? Or would it instead measure success in the narrow terms that Manchester City Council has used? It was bragging that, last year, it had one in 20 of its entire population under an ASBO.

I am sure that the minister was looking forward to it as well&#8212;I think that secretly he enjoys hearing the Green party criticise his transport policy. However, when I opened the \"National Planning Framework for Scotland: Monitoring Report 06\" last week, my heart sank and I realised that yet again I would have to speak about the lack of support shown for crossrail.</p><p>The report's purpose is to inform the review and revision process for the next national planning framework. There are eight paragraphs about internal connectivity, but once again it is a document without a single word about the Glasgow crossrail scheme. It talks about more speculative projects further in the future&#8212;such as the high-speed rail link to the south, which we would all like but which is not happening yet&#8212;but it does not say anything about crossrail, for which there is already clear case and detailed proposals that can be examined. As Wendy Alexander said, it is a strategically significant rail project&#8212;perhaps the most strategically significant in Scotland&#8212;but there is not a word about it in that document.</p><p>That reflects the different priorities that have been attached to crossrail and projects such as the M74 extension. I think that Wendy Alexander implicitly acknowledged that the M74 extension is environmentally damaging, as the local public inquiry explicitly reported. I would prefer that we did not simply match an environmentally damaging project with a more environmentally benign project, such as improvements to our rail infrastructure; I would prefer that we did the latter instead of the former. However, there is different political weight and momentum behind such projects. Labour and Liberal Democrat ministers have consistently given their backing to one, but are not yet able to do the same for the other. I hope that we will hear a little more from the minister today.</p><p>As I argued in the recent debate on the Glasgow airport rail link, we need to consider our priorities. What are our objectives in spending large <place-holder colnum=\"27951\"/> amounts of money on transport infrastructure? In the world as we find it, our top priority can only be tackling climate change and ensuring that in future generations there is a civilisation that can enjoy the benefits of the infrastructure and services that we put in place. Next we have to look at the local environment&#8212;pollution, congestion and the risk of road traffic accidents that comes from the additional congestion that people in Glasgow suffer. Then we consider economic development, and finally we look at how we project ourselves, whether that is in relation to Commonwealth games bids or tourism, for example. That should be the order of priorities, and it is clear that, if it was, the crossrail scheme would get a tick in the box long before the minister came to think about the M74.</p><p>I hope that the monitoring report is the last shiny document that I read without an endorsement of crossrail.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13367803", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Crossrail"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to Bill Butler on securing the debate and on his work in bringing together the cross-party group on Glasgow crossrail.

I am a member of a small group in the Parliament that does not have a representative on every committee, so I often find myself coming completely fresh to a bill at the stage 1 debate. I have no doubt that every committee aims to make its reports useful to members who are in my position, to allow them to get to grips with a bill straight away. The stage 1 report on the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Bill achieves that objective better than most, so I thank the Justice 1 Committee's members and clerks for their work.</p><p>One issue that the report deals with early in relation to bail provisions is the question of why legislation should be introduced if no substantial changes are to be made. Although I accept the value of the flexibility that exists at the moment, I agree with the Executive's objective of making the law more widely understood. Writing it down seems like a good first step. However, unusually, I find myself siding with the Executive's original position on the issue of public interest versus public safety. Both terms are of value and seem on the surface to say what they mean, but in fact both are subject to wide interpretation. We must, of course, aim to protect public safety, but it would be a mistake for us to follow a line of reasoning that leads to the conclusion that we can protect public safety only by refusing bail. Where other ways of protecting public safety exist, it is in the public interest to grant bail, and it should be considered.</p><p>I look forward to seeing the detail of the Executive's proposed stage 2 amendment, which it stated in its response to the committee's report it intends to lodge</p><p class=\"indent\">\"to include a direct reference to 'public safety' in those provisions in a manner that does not prejudice the overall framework\".</p><p>I worry that that will introduce more complexity into the legislation, which might undermine the objective of increasing widespread public understanding of the law.</p><p>I agree with the Executive on the issue of previous convictions for serious offences. A previous conviction may well be an indication of a risk of reoffending, but not in all cases. For example, if someone was convicted of an offence a number of years previously or the offence was <place-holder colnum=\"27589\"/> committed in different circumstances, taking the Executive's route would seem to undermine the discretion of the court. Granting bail only in exceptional circumstances is too much. However, I agree that there is a need for greater explanation of the reasons for and implications of bail decisions. The decision to provide that is to be welcomed.</p><p>I turn to increased sentences for bail offences. The increases are significant, and if the Executive wants to make the case for them it must do so on the basis that it genuinely believes that they will make bail offences less common. If they do not, they will lead only to an increased prison population. If we can reduce the number of bail offences, that is all well and good, but if we attempt to do so by increasing sentences and that attempt fails, we may be stuck with the policy. It would be very difficult politically to reverse that policy change if it failed on those grounds. The committee is right to examine the wider reasons for people's failure to attend court hearings and to mention issues such as addiction and homelessness. I am glad that the Executive addresses those issues in such detail in its response to the committee's report. However, the criminal justice system as a whole still fails to give offenders who face such problems the best chance of getting their lives together and stopping reoffending. If we want a system that serves the whole of society, the objective must be to change that.</p><p>I turn to part 2. The committee expressed significant concerns in a number of areas. Not least, it mentioned the difficulty that it experienced in giving a view when the context of provisions was not known because the Executive had not shared its non-legislative plans ahead of the committee's consideration of the bill. The Executive is right to say that the quicker the criminal justice system deals with cases, the more effective the intervention may be. However, here in Parliament the reverse is often true. We should take the time that is necessary for careful and fully informed consideration.</p><p>I am pleased that in her opening speech the minister endorsed the principle of lay justice as part of the system. No doubt there will be on-going debates about precisely what role it should play. On that issue and the issue of alternatives to prosecution, I hope that the Executive's emphasis will be on relevant work in communities that is designed to change behaviour, not merely to send a signal or to have a stream of offenders take part in meaningless activity.</p><p>Taken together, meaningful, restorative, practical and reparative work by offenders and the use of lay justice, including scope for examining the possibility of peer justice for young offenders, <place-holder colnum=\"27590\"/> could offer the prospect of much more radical reform. However, what we have is the bill that is before us, and the Greens will vote for it this evening, albeit with reservations, some of which have been expressed by Christine Grahame.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13366987", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "After Donald Gorrie's speech, members will hear the second speech in a row from a self-confessed amateur.

People will just think of you as 'the gay one'.\" I understand why he said that, but I genuinely do not believe that if a black or other minority ethnic MSP had been elected he or she would have been advised, \"Don't say anything about racism. People will just think of you as 'the black one'.\" For that reason, I rejected the advice. I understand why Iain Smith says that today's debate should not be dominated by one issue, but I make no apology for devoting my remarks to it.</p><p>Much of the bill should be entirely uncontroversial. No one could disagree with a word of the policy objectives and, from the responses of the organisations that provide services on the ground, it is clear that few could argue with much of the detail of the bill. The only reason for any controversy is a demand that we abandon the principle of considering potential adoptive parents on their merits, taking into account the interests of the child as our paramount concern, and instead rule out of consideration whole groups in society, without knowing anything about individuals' circumstances. Never mind the implicit insult that that proposal represents to existing unmarried couples and same-sex couples who are parents and who, like other parents, are <place-holder colnum=\"27427\"/> doing their best for the children in their lives. Let us ignore that insult for a moment and look at the proposal. It is based on the assumption that such parents are inferior parents&#8212;that they will do a less decent job and that their children will suffer harm because of that aspect of their lives. If that assumption is to be put to us seriously, it should be backed up by robust evidence.</p><p>Instead of decent research that backs up the assumption, however, we have seen the kind of junk science that has been circulated to MSPs by the Christian Institute, and a prejudiced letter. I do not conflate religion with prejudice; there are atheists&#8212;I am an atheist&#8212;who are prejudiced against people on ground of sexuality. Just as I do not blame their atheism for that, I do not blame religion for Bishop Devine's prejudice, although prejudice it is.</p><p>Let us look at his letter. The thing that struck me most in the letter that we have all received is the different language that is used to describe different human beings in our society. When describing married mixed-sex couples, the bishop writes of \"a loving environment\", a \"wholesome home life\" and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the care and protection of a mother and father.\"</p><p>However, when describing same-sex couples who are, in my view, also loving to each other and their children if they have them, the bishop uses the phrase \"homosexual lifestyles\". Frankly, the man knows nothing about my lifestyle or any of the lifestyles of the people he writes about. In my reply to the letter, I highlighted that difference in language and explained the insult that it implies.</p><p>I highlighted another aspect of the letter, which almost made me smile when I read it. It appears to present the image of a society in which religious communities are excluded from the Executive's policy-making process while lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organisations are free to take what the bishop calls \"gay demands\" right to the heart of Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. As members are well aware, this week the First Minister held a meeting, as he does frequently, with leaders of religious communities from throughout Scotland, at which I am sure they discussed a range of policy issues. LGBT organisations, like most others, have to go through the normal policy-making and consultation processes. I am sure that they would expect nothing less.</p><p>I mentioned in my letter to the bishop my criticism of the Executive on matters such as sending responsibility for civil partnerships to Westminster or not legislating on hate crimes, but I doubt that I will persuade the bishop that religious communities are taken more seriously than LGBT communities in Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"27428\"/></p><p>The last point that I made to the bishop was the disappointment that I feel when religious communities are so misrepresented by their own leaders.</p>", "hdate": "2006-09-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13366490", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Very shortly after I was elected to Parliament, I was given some advice by a well-meaning journalist&#8212;there are some out there.

I welcome the fact that the minister has made it clear that it will be changed at stage 2, but I still find it bizarre that it was introduced, as it seems guaranteed to provoke a defensive reaction. To force individuals to pay simply because a complaint has been raised, regardless of its merits, seems extraordinarily unfair. Would we place that expectation on people in any other walk of life? Would we place such a burden on police officers, so that a police officer would have to pay if a complaint were made against them? Would we place such a burden on ourselves, as MSPs, so that we would have to pay for the Scottish parliamentary standards commissioner to investigate complaints against us, regardless of their merit? I do not think that we would. I am, therefore, surprised that such an approach was even suggested in relation to complaints taken to the Scottish legal complaints commission.</p><p>As for the impact of the complaints levy on small firms in general when complaints are upheld, I hope that it will not be a harsh, punitive system.

That response, and the amendments that the minister has said he will lodge at stage 2, are an implicit acknowledgement of the fact that the bill as introduced took the wrong approach.

One of my most interesting experiences on Glasgow buses is of being recognised and falling into conversation with other bus passengers. They are often surprised that MSPs do not take taxis everywhere. I am sure that that is a mistake on their part and that many other members are also regular bus users. However, it is interesting that they are surprised, and I find those conversations much more useful and valuable than the average conversation with a taxi driver.</p><p>What are the experiences of people who use buses? I accept entirely what Bill Butler said about the withdrawal of existing services, but there is also the question of the quality of existing services. For many years, fares have been rising steadily in relation to the cost of driving, and are far too high. There is often little prior notice when fares change, and people are expected to turn up with the right change&#8212;oh, yes, because it seems impossible to run a bus service and give people change&#8212;without knowing the fare. There are also periods when prices are bizarre: odd numbers with sevens and threes, and no expectation that people will get their change.</p><p>Information is lacking at bus stops. Information about what buses turn up and when should be really easy for bus companies and SPT to provide. The information is not always missing because bus stops have been vandalised, but often because nobody bothered to put it up in the first place. There is also the question of incorrect information on the inside and front of buses, including electronic systems that do not work properly and which show passengers where they have just left rather than where they are going.</p><p>As well as routes being lost, some are being doubled up. Some of the smaller operators genuinely add something to the service in Glasgow, but others just hover in front of the FirstBus service in the hope of catching a few stray passengers as the queues lengthen. Such smaller operators do not add anything to the quality of the services.</p><p>I also have to say with regret that I have seen appallingly racist, sexist and homophobic behaviour from drivers on Glasgow buses. That is not acceptable.</p><p>What is the solution? In the 20-odd seconds that I have left, I do not propose to revisit all the recommendations that the Local Government and Transport Committee made in its report last year. However, some recommendations have not been acted on, and I look forward to hearing the Minister for Transport say when we will see a proper response to the recommendations. Some form of regulation or reregulation should be appropriate, and we should not shy away from that.<place-holder colnum=\"27236\"/></p><p>We should also remind the Executive that it invests &#163;500 million in building motorways in a city where most people depend on buses to get around because they do not have access to a car.

That is no bad thing, but it is not a top priority.</p><p>The arguments about sustainability that have been mentioned as part of the bill's policy objectives are absurd, particularly&#8212;as Fergus Ewing is right to say&#8212;because those arguments are comprehensively undermined by political support for ever-greater growth of air traffic.

I go further and say that we should argue that the road should be seen as the premium service. Road traffic is the form of transport that does the greatest damage and which must bear the greatest cost as a result. We can take significant measures to ensure that we use the rail link as a way of taking traffic off the roads and on to the rails and not as a way of increasing the total capacity for traffic to the airport, which will fuel traffic growth.</p><p>I repeat my qualified support and I absolutely implore the minister to go further than he has gone in supporting Glasgow crossrail as soon as possible.</p>", "hdate": "2006-06-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13364957", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill: Preliminary Stage"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will discuss that in a moment.

In recognising the strength of the economic case, we need also to recognise carers as a workforce for which we have the same responsibilities as we do for any other workforce.</p><p>The idea of focusing on flexible working patterns and enabling people to retain employment if they choose to do so is also important. Although we seem to hear a lot about flexible working patterns from employers, the flexibility seems to work only one way&#8212;employees are often called on to be flexible, employers rarely so.</p><p>The Green party's citizens income policy is relevant to the debate. Our policy would see a payment made to all citizens; people should benefit economically from the society in which they live. We see a citizens income as a right and not a payment in exchange for unpaid work. The aim is to give people the flexibility to make choices at different times in their lives, which could include <place-holder colnum=\"26707\"/> combining work or education with the care of a relative or a friend.</p><p>Beyond the economic case, a discrimination and rights-based case needs to be made. In calling for a rights-based approach to be taken, the care 21 report, \"The Future of Unpaid Care in Scotland\", recognised that fact. If we agree not to exploit carers as a workforce but to give them rights, we need to ask ourselves not only what support carers need but what their needs and rights are. We need to find a way for carers to articulate those needs and rights at a stage in the process before the decisions are made on the services that are provided to them and the way in which they are delivered.</p><p>The care 21 report quotes a carer as saying:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"'The reality is if social work says they can't do something because of health and safety and the nursing staff can't do it and it still needs to be done. Who does it? The informal carer - there you go.'\"</p><p>That sums up the argument very well. It shows a workforce whose time and effort is being taken advantage of. The strong motivation of carers should not be exploited.</p><p>The human rights case&#8212;the rights-based case&#8212;calls on us not only to uphold and celebrate our human rights legislation but to go further. I hope that that will happen when, after the summer recess, we establish the Scottish commissioner for human rights. The commissioner should have the power to look at issues to do with how support services are provided to people and to investigate individual cases in which carers believe that their human rights were not taken into account in the service design.</p><p>The issue is very much in keeping with the Executive's access to justice agenda.

That would be an effective way of reducing crime, but most people, including the victims of crime, want to live in a free society.

Many people outwith the chamber might be astonished by that fact and I admit that I had to run three or four searches of the <em>Official Report</em> on the Parliament's website before I could quite believe it. However, we should thank Bill Butler for securing this debate on the subject.</p><p>Bill Butler said that sectarianism has been downplayed by some people, that some have argued that the subject is best not talked about and that, if we do not talk about it, it will just go away. He was right to dismiss that view. We can talk about the legislative measures that the Executive is putting in place and give the Executive credit for being willing to talk about the issue. I commend the Executive on the approach that it has taken. People from many sectors such as sport, the media, education, local authorities, the voluntary sector and the churches have been brought together in the symposium in a way that strikes me as being a positive model for facilitating dialogue and co-operation, which could be used in other areas that are not quite so contentious.</p><p>Many of the issues that members have talked about have been to do with football clubs. Several members have said that the clubs have made progress, but that there is more that they can do. Bill Aitken said that it is understandable that the clubs sometimes want to hang on to their traditions. However, we should remember that they are businesses. They are substantial commercial operations. I do not have the full answer, but we need to ask how we can make it clear to the clubs that the way for them to be profitable is to address the problem and that, if they do not do that extra work and, in two or three years' time, we are still saying, \"They've done something, but they could do a bit more\", they will have to face the financial consequences.</p><p>Members talked about the role of education. We cannot underestimate that. The motion mentions</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the twinning of denominational and non-denominational schools.\"</p><p>I have never made any secret of the fact that, for a number of reasons, I would prefer to live in a society that did not have religious education. However, although that view might be more common outside the chamber than in it, I recognise that religious education is not likely to go away soon. The twinning of schools therefore seems to me to be a positive step forward, although I have spoken to parents who are far more concerned about dilapidated schools being <place-holder colnum=\"25964\"/> repaired, renewed and rebuilt than they are about hanging on to a particular model of denominational schooling.</p><p>The motion also mentions</p><p class=\"indent\">\"challenging sectarian attitudes and improving young people's understanding of each others' cultural identities\".</p><p>Of course, education is a profound opportunity to address that. I have a concern, though. We should ask ourselves why religious identity remains strong at a time when religion and faith are of decreasing importance to people in Scotland&#8212;with between a quarter and a third either declaring no religion or affirming that they have no religion&#8212;and at a time when many people who tick one of the religious boxes on the census form probably would not put their religion at the top of their priorities in life. At a time when religion itself and the practice of religion are of decreasing importance, why does religious identity, which is not about faith or belief, remain so strong? That is a difficult question to answer. Sometimes, it might be a difficult question to ask.</p><p>Education offers an opportunity not only to address religious identity and cultural identity and to challenge attitudes and discrimination, but to put those things in the context of all the other forms of discrimination that remain prevalent in our society. The Scottish social attitudes survey shows that there are other forms of discrimination that are found to be more acceptable than sectarian discrimination.</p><p>I agree with Bill Butler that it is wrong to brush the matter under the carpet, but when we discuss it, particularly with children in schools, we must break down the barriers between cultural identities rather than reinforce them.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13362569", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sectarianism"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "When I saw the number of members who had stayed behind after decision time, I thought that we might be here until about 8 o'clock.

From the pre-legislative stage of the proposals, the process has been thorough and many individuals and organisations who contributed to the process and spoke to the committee about the bill acknowledged the efforts of the team.</p><p>It is right that we make a significant effort on the bill, which represents a major opportunity to help to set the context for pretty much all physical development in Scotland, perhaps for decades. That being so, despite my many concerns about the direction that the Executive is taking, I will mention positive elements in the bill.</p><p>In a devolved context, the planning system is one of the most significant tools that we have to help to facilitate a transition towards a fundamentally more sustainable society. Therefore I welcome enthusiastically the proposed new duty on Scotland's councils to perform their planning functions with the objective of contributing to sustainable development. I am pleased that the <place-holder colnum=\"25653\"/> Executive accepted the argument that in taking more substantial planning functions by putting the national planning framework on a statutory basis, it should itself be under a duty to consider sustainable development. I commend the Executive for agreeing to lodge an amendment to that effect.</p><p>The subtle shift in the Executive's language about priorities has been interesting to witness. The partnership agreement put economic growth on a pedestal, but the white paper, \"Modernising the planning system\" referred to \"sustainable economic growth\", which apparently reflected a recognition that not all activity that generates growth is to be welcomed. During the progress of the bill, the phrase, \"sustainable economic development\" has been used more frequently. I hope that the trend will continue and that future Executive policy will give clear priority to sustainable development and not just economic development.</p><p>The Executive's aspirations in introducing the bill are for a fairer, more balanced planning system, as well as for a more efficient system. I have little doubt that the bill will help to achieve the progress towards efficiency that developers and planning authorities want&#8212;I am not opposed to that. I have little doubt that the bill will provide people in Scotland with opportunities to put across their views through consultation at all levels in the planning system&#8212;I am not opposed to that.</p><p>The issues on which I disagree are described in the amendment, which sets out four major objectives that we should set ourselves in reforming the planning system. First, we must restore public trust, which is at a low ebb. Secondly, we must rebalance the rights that people can exercise, which are currently stacked in favour of developers and against even the most proactive, articulate and constructive community. Thirdly, we must give clarity, so that not just developers but all interested parties, such as the people who have to live with the impact of planning decisions, know what to expect from the planning system. Fourthly, we must ensure that the planning functions that are exercised nationally by ministers are subject to meaningful scrutiny in public and in the Parliament.</p><p>I am sure that few people would deny&#8212;and the Executive acknowledges&#8212;that public trust in the planning system is low. There can hardly be a constituency, or even a council ward, in Scotland in which planning issues have not caused at least some controversy or anger. Undoubtedly, some people's engagement with the planning system can be described as nimbyism or just plain selfishness, but I am convinced that they are a minority. Most people who engage with the planning system do so out of genuine concern <place-holder colnum=\"25654\"/> about their community's future and the environmental and social impacts of development&#8212;they are not anti development. Many people find that engaging with the system is like banging their head off a brick wall.</p><p>How can we regain people's trust? Planning will always be contentious and it will never be possible to please everybody or give everybody the outcome that they want on every issue. However, although the Executive has responded well to the business community's demands for the reforms that it wants, it has ignored the reasonable and restrained calls for more fairness in the system for communities, which is not the right approach. We should make it clear that people are not mere extras in the system and we can do that by giving them some power. Trust is not a one-way street. If we want people to trust the planning system, we must trust them to exercise real rights responsibly.</p><p>The debate on the bill is often dominated by the issue of a third-party right of appeal. My second theme is the balance between rights and consultation. Even the term \"third-party right of appeal\" seems to demean people who engage in the system. Calling them third parties implies that they are lesser parties or bystanders when, in fact, the people who live with the good and bad consequences of development should be at the heart of the system. I endorse a TPRA, not because I want there to be lots of appeals, but because I want a fairer system. The Executive acknowledges the unfairness of the current system, in which a community that has worked hard, perhaps for years, to oppose an unwelcome development may win its case, only to find that the developer has another roll of the dice. However, if the developer wins the first round, it is game over. The Executive acknowledges that unfairness but chooses not to end it.</p><p>I want to broaden out the issue beyond one set of rights and talk about the balance between rights and consultation. We all know that consultation can sometimes be a good thing, but it can also sometimes be a bit of a tick-box exercise. I am sure that the Executive fully intends to support innovative and meaningful approaches to participation and consultation, all of which have value. However, the value will be lost if the consultation is seen as an alternative to real rights. People will have fewer rights under the new system than they have at present. Ministers must acknowledge the deep cynicism about consultation, which has been compounded by the fact that the overwhelmingly positive response to the consultation on wider rights of appeal fell on deaf ears. For people to engage, we must give them certainty that their views have weight.</p><p>My amendment calls for greater clarity on the hierarchy of developments. Pretty well everybody <place-holder colnum=\"25655\"/> agrees that a hierarchy is a good idea in principle. The hierarchy will help to deal with the absurd situation that it is difficult for planning departments to devote the appropriate level of resources to the applications that truly merit those resources. However, too much has been left out of the bill. The bill does not tell people what they can expect of the hierarchy; which kinds of development will fall into which category; whether the same formulaic approach will be used in all parts of the country or whether a more flexible approach will be taken; or in what circumstances the Executive will use its powers to recategorise particular developments. If we want to give clarity, not only to developers about the timescales for planning decisions but to communities about what they can expect from the system, we need a little more in the bill.</p><p>The fourth theme in my amendment is the national planning framework and scrutiny. In the Communities Committee, I argued consistently against the 40-day time limit for scrutiny of the framework and I was disappointed that more committee members were not willing to challenge that. I am not opposed to the statutory nature of the NPF or to the possibility of including specific developments of national importance in it. However, I object to the reduced opportunity that people will have to challenge proposals once they have been included in the framework and the cursory nature of the proposed scrutiny process.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361873", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Planning etc (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "It is not unusual for a Green to be outside even \"a strikingly broad consensus\".

There is little recognition of what a stark option that is or of the fact that the facilities that allow that to be done are limited. Drug-using parents are often stereotyped as being uncaring and incapable people when, although their ability to be parents may be restricted, in most cases they have something to offer. The simplistic assumption is made that the high-profile, extreme scenarios are the norm. We should acknowledge that that is not the case. All those ideas, assumptions and stereotypes are deeply unhelpful.</p><p>We must consider what would be helpful. Much of what is contained in the Executive's report is helpful. It recognises that we must focus on the best interests of the children. I hope that I misheard Annabel Goldie, but I think that she suggested that children could be taken into care as an incentive or a deterrent. The extreme action of taking a child into care must be taken only to protect that child's welfare; it should not be used as an incentive or a deterrent.</p><p>\"Hidden Harm&#8212;Next Steps\" points out that it is not appropriate to apply the same approach on every occasion.

My party and the Scottish Socialist Party would like the criminal law to be used in a very different way; in that regard, we do not sign up to the consensus that exists among the majority of members. We should all aim to ensure that when people come into contact with the criminal law because of their drug using, that serves as a route to support, treatment and services rather than a route into the punitive system of prison. We should recognise the deeply damaging impact that imprisonment can have not only on the individuals concerned, but on their families. In that context, I highlight the work of the happy project in Glasgow, which works with the families and youngsters of prisoners to ensure that contact is maintained.</p>", "hdate": "2006-05-11", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13361751", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Drugs and Hidden Harm"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I certainly welcome the opportunity to debate the Executive's report.

Of course they do not. Members should consider the proliferation incentives that have been created for India, Israel, Pakistan, Iran and North Korea and compare the number of proposals for sanctions against or invasion of Iran with those that have been made with respect to North Korea. We know that North Korea already has nuclear weapons, which is why no one proposes to invade it to dismantle its capabilities.</p><p>Euan Robson said that members should support the Liberal Democrats' amendment. I would welcome a white paper from the United Kingdom Government, which would be a useful contribution to the debate, but while white papers often precede new legislation on which members of Parliament are permitted to vote&#8212;sometimes even according to their consciences&#8212;that would not happen in this case. The UK Government has said that MPs will not yet be allowed to vote on the matter. That is why I cannot support the Liberal Democrats' amendment. Mike Rumbles spoke in support of it and talked about how much he disagrees with replacing Trident, but the amendment calls for retention of our nuclear capability for the foreseeable future, which I cannot support.</p><p>Rosie Kane mentioned the Executive's non-attendance at the debate. I am happy to give ministers their lie-in, which I hope they enjoy.

A challenge for the Parliament, and the political Parties would be to have a genuinely open consultation with the people of Scotland on the question of Trident, and allow MSPs to vote according to their conscience.\"</p><p>I agree with one thing that Mike Rumbles said: this is a moral issue. I get bored and sick and tired of people who say that moral issues in politics are about finger wagging and who people go to bed with. That is narrow-minded nonsense. There are great moral issues of our age, for example the degradation of our environment, the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers in our communities and the treatment of prisoners. Retaining or replacing Trident is one of the great moral issues. It is disappointing that all three parties that dominate Westminster politics are committed to retaining nuclear arsenals.

I do not want to see the Executive's view every time; I want to hear about the shades of grey. I want to hear the other side of the story. It is not enough to know that the Presiding Officer, who I am sure takes the responsibility very seriously, assures us that the bill, as introduced, is compliant with human rights legislation. I want to hear the arguments from both sides, and I also want there to be an independent voice who will advise me about a bill as it is going through Parliament.</p><p>I remember that the provisions of the Family Law (Scotland) Bill, which went through Parliament not so long ago, had been widely trailed and consulted on, especially those on the reduction in the waiting time for the dissolution of a civil partnership or for divorce. At almost the last minute, amendments were agreed to that would have meant that the bill was not compliant with human rights principles. The Executive eventually had to lodge amendments to seek to increase the waiting time for the dissolution of a civil partnership just in case the amendments that sought to increase the waiting time for divorce were agreed to.

The many barriers to justice can be physical and emotional, but today we are talking about barriers of knowledge, barriers of geography and the availability of services locally, as Kenny MacAskill mentioned, and barriers of finance.</p><p>It is often remarked that justice delayed is justice denied. Similarly, justice at a price is justice denied to all but the wealthy few. I welcome some of the remarks in the minister's opening speech. It is good to hear the positive noises about the use of mediation, the recognition of the role of citizens advice bureaux and the statement that pilot projects are on the way. However, we should acknowledge that some organisations, notably Citizens Advice Scotland, have expressed disappointment. CAS's briefing to members for today's debate expresses disappointment that the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill</p><p class=\"indent\">\"will only marginally increase the availability of quality assured legal advice.\"</p><p>The briefing highlights</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the precarious ... funding for advice by non-solicitors\",</p><p>as well as</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the large unmet need for legal advice\"</p><p>and</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the need for preventative measures\".</p><p>If we expand services and if the reform that we all want is put in place, there will be many ways other than the courts of ensuring that people can access their rights and justice. However, I want to highlight two examples of legislative work by the Executive in relation to which departments other than the Justice Department have not quite been singing the same tune.</p><p>One example is the recent Housing (Scotland) Bill, to which I proposed amendments that would have introduced management standards in the private rented sector. The aim was not to increase the legal rights of, and protections available to, tenants in the sector, but to give tenants additional ways of seeking redress when those rights are denied. For the most part, when landlords harass people or treat them badly, they do not go to court about it; they put up with it or accept it&#8212;that is what I did in that situation. For that reason, we have no idea how many thousands of tenants in the private rented sector simply put up with <place-holder colnum=\"24873\"/> problems, move on and try to get into a better housing situation.</p><p>The introduction of management standards would have allowed people to access the private rented housing panel instead of going to the courts. The panel could have resolved problems more quickly and easily and certainly more cheaply. That ability to resolve problems without people needing to go to court might well have prevented many unscrupulous landlords&#8212;who, I am glad to say, are in the minority&#8212;from denying their tenants existing legal rights. However, the Executive resisted my amendments and argued that people can go to the courts to access those rights. That trend should be resisted.</p><p>The same argument has been deployed in debates on the Planning etc (Scotland) Bill. Jeremy Purvis mentioned a couple of planning cases. Planning cases might not be the first example that we think of in considering the civil justice system, but when a community has worked long and hard to engage positively with the planning system and feels that the eventual decision has been taken on the wrong basis and should be overturned, often in Edinburgh going to court is the only way in which it can overturn it.

We should consider what achieving the four key objectives that the Commission has set itself&#8212;prosperity, solidarity, security and Europe as a world partner&#8212;could mean for a better world.</p><p>It will not come as much of a surprise to hear that I, as a Green, would like an attempt to be made to refine prosperity. Green parties around the world have a role to play as part of a wider green movement, which includes people with other political perspectives. There is now broad acceptance of the idea that if developing countries develop in the unsustainable manner in which we have developed, global catastrophe will result. That concept is important not just at a global level but at a European level. As the European Union grows, we must find ways to propose courses of development for the new accession countries that do not echo the mistakes of our past but seek to create a better future for us all. I believe that Scotland would be up for the challenge of such change if we were represented.</p><p>I turn to solidarity, which seems implicitly to cover social justice as well as environmental issues, so I will address both. I would love to see a European Commission work programme make a climate stability pact for Europe a priority. Europe can be a world leader on the issue to a greater extent than it has been. It has done good stuff and made good progress, but placing as great an emphasis on environmental issues as is placed on economic issues would be a good start. A climate stability pact, which my colleagues in Europe have proposed, would be one way to proceed to ensure that the EU does not plunder fish stocks not only here but around the world, as we are doing at the moment, often as a result of poorly enforced and monitored agreements leading to continuing illegal fishing and the depletion of fish stocks, which has an impact on rural communities in Europe and around the world.</p><p>Security is not an end in itself. If we want to live in a peaceful world, we are more likely to achieve it through justice than through security alone. We can do much at European level to promote fundamental rights. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is a terrific document, but it should be made binding so that all people who live in Europe&#8212;including economic migrants, political refugees and other refugees&#8212;have access to those fundamental rights.<place-holder colnum=\"24720\"/></p><p>Threats to our freedom come not only from outside&#8212;from other countries and groups that are often stereotyped&#8212;but from our own Governments.

Today, however, the consequences are being talked of much more in terms of opportunities and benefits. To be honest, neither analysis has a monopoly on truth. Both interpretations have something to offer the debate.</p><p>The Executive's consultation reflects the fact that the issues that affect older people cover the full range and that older people are not a simplistic stereotype any more than are any of the other groups that we refer to in relation to equality strands.</p><p>The minister mentioned recent equality legislation, which includes the Westminster Equality Act 2006, under which the commission for equality and human rights&#8212;which will enforce provisions against age discrimination&#8212;will be set up. There is also legislation that gives us our devolved responsibility to promote equal opportunities. Those are important changes that will impact on many of the aspects of life that are distinctive for older people.</p><p>On work, Donald Gorrie was right when he talked about flexibility. After all, politicians make flexible provision for themselves in their retirement. When Westminster politicians graduate out of the Commons after many years and the constituency burden is lifted from their shoulders, they are still able to contribute from another chamber. Why should we not give that kind of flexibility to people in many different walks of life and jobs and enable them to continue to contribute at a level that is appropriate for them? Most people want to work in some way or other. That is reflected in the high level of volunteering among older people.</p><p>The diverse range of housing needs that people have must be recognised. Although some want to stay in the home that they have lived in for many years, Roseanna Cunningham is right to recognise the benefits of co-housing. She has already dealt with that issue, so I will not go into it in great detail. However, I will say that many people want to share their housing socially with other people.</p><p>We have said that older people are not a simplistic stereotype. That means that the services that we deliver have to reflect the diversity of older people. As Scotland's population ages, those services will encounter a far greater level of diversity in cultural and religious terms as our new <place-holder colnum=\"24391\"/> Scots, welcome as they are, age and begin to need to take up those services.</p><p>Sexual diversity is another part of the changing picture. Services for older people&#8212;particularly residential services&#8212;are quite used to seeing people who, sadly, start to experience dementia. Those people might have lived in the closet all their lives. Perhaps they were brought up at a time when being sexually different meant imprisonment or what today we would call psychological torture. Even though that is no longer the case, they live with those attitudes because they were ingrained at the time. If they are no longer able to maintain the pretence of living in the closet, which their families are used to, the already distressing experience of dementia can be all the more shocking for their families to encounter.</p><p>However, that situation will diminish and, instead, services for older people will encounter more people who are out and who have been living with a same-sex partner for many years. By then, we might even say that they have been married for many years. Services will need to adapt and be willing to challenge the prejudice that exists in residential settings.</p><p>I want to comment on the structure of communities.

The Executive is right to address the demographic problem that Scotland faces with the falling population and, more specifically, the fall in the working-age population. We shall be addressing the issue of the aging <place-holder colnum=\"24166\"/> population next week in Parliament, but it is useful to hold a discussion on the committee's report and on the fresh talent initiative today.</p><p>The distinction between the falling population and the falling working-age population is an important one. Although my Green colleagues in the Scottish Parliament are doing their bit to tackle the falling population, with no fewer than four births in the first half of this year alone&#8212;I have to admit that I have no intention whatever of adding to that total myself&#8212;we must recognise that the issue of our population's economic engagement is different to the issue of the size of our population.</p><p>Attracting new people to Scotland can be a positive thing, and one great change to the city of Glasgow over recent years has been the increasing diversity of culture, language, food and art, which are side benefits to the economic benefits that are sought. However, Glasgow has something else too. Phil Gallie may have left it until the fifth minute of a four-minute speech, but he eventually mentioned the fact that Glasgow also faces the problem of high levels of economic inactivity. I support the view of representatives from the Scottish Trades Union Congress who gave evidence to the committee that much more needs to be done to address that problem.</p><p>Although I accept that the fresh talent target of 8,000 people a year was indicative, I reiterate the figure, which already been mentioned, of 688,000 economically inactive people in Scotland, however open to question that figure might be. Bringing some of those people into economic activity is not something that can be done easily or quickly, and I do not pretend that there are simple solutions to the problem. It will require the innovative use of powers that still reside at Westminster. Can we be sure that they will be exercised innovatively and in a way that is appropriate to Scotland's distinctive situation? Personally, I doubt it.</p><p>However, there is another group of economically inactive people in Scotland, and Jim Wallace and Linda Fabiani have mentioned them. Asylum seekers are economically inactive for no good reason, and most of them are prohibited from working. I stress that a mutual benefit could be gained by giving asylum seekers the right to work. There would be benefits to our economy as a whole and to sectors of our economy that are finding it difficult to attract workers with the right skills, but there would be benefits to the asylum seekers as well, whether they ultimately stay or leave and whether or not they gain refugee status. Can any of us&#8212;even those of us who have been unemployed for a long period of time&#8212;imagine the sense of prolonged stress, isolation and fear that comes from being an asylum seeker? If we imagine in addition to that the utterly frustrating boredom of being unable to put one's skills to <place-holder colnum=\"24167\"/> good use, we can begin to recognise how changing the situation and giving people the right to work while they are here is something that would provide great mutual benefit.</p><p>I know that I am short of time, but I want to mention another issue that Jim Wallace raised. The committee should be commended for saying something about the potential impact of the initiative on other countries, especially developing countries. If we gain skills for our economy at the expense of the economies of developing countries, we should be thoroughly ashamed of ourselves. We must ensure that any benefit to our country does not come at the expense of people in the world's most deprived countries.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13358171", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Fresh Talent Initiative"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate and I commend the European and External Relations Committee for its report.

The inter-European parliamentary forum on population and development&#8212;I admit that that is not the snappiest title an organisation might have&#8212;seeks to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights, the lack of which is deeply linked to poverty. In extreme cases, more than 30 per cent of a country's population might be HIV positive. The approach of some Governments in promoting the idea that it is wrong to use condoms is not morally defensible and has huge economic, as well as social and human, impacts.</p><p>In other developing countries that do not suffer from that particular chronic problem, the extent to which people have sexual and reproductive health and rights has a profound impact on poverty. We all acknowledge that the status of women in society is connected to poverty and is an important factor in a country's development. The issue is not just a matter of education. The right to make choices about how many children to have, when to have them and with whom is fundamental. The power to exercise that right is fundamental to women's position in society and the development of society. It is not a coincidence that most women in developed countries are accustomed to having such rights and take them for granted.</p><p>It was important that the European forum hosted the conference that I mentioned, which took place before the G8 summit at Gleneagles. The aim of the conference was to influence the summit agenda, because there are countries&#8212;such as America&#8212;and institutions that go around the world attacking the idea that everyone should have sexual and reproductive rights; they seek to deny those rights to people in developing countries and even threaten to remove them from people in developed countries.</p><p>In the light of that international dynamic, it is essential that countries that are committed to sexual and reproductive health and rights advocate their position with clarity and consistency.

However, we should also pay tribute to <place-holder colnum=\"23850\"/> other groups of people. They are the people&#8212;I have met some of them in Paul Martin's constituency&#8212;who not only make positive choices in their own lives, but work hard in their communities to encourage others to make such choices. Those people include police officers and addiction workers, and social workers who should be given the credit that they are due. It is wrong and simplistic to consider a high-profile case, however tragic and heartrending, and put the problem down, simplistically, to failure by social workers. Not only is that the wrong position to take, but it demeans a group of hard-working professionals who rarely get the credit that they are due.</p><p>Each amendment to the motion has something that I can welcome. The amendments and the motion recognise that victims of addiction are people whose welfare should be important to us. We must reject the tabloid simplicity of dehumanising stereotypes and recognise that people who are addicted are human beings. I believe&#8212;almost as an article of faith, to be honest&#8212;that human behaviour is purposeful and motivated; even self-destructive and harmful behaviour is purposeful and motivated. Human beings have a range of different experiences, attitudes, values and motivations. For that reason, a range of different responses is called for from us as policy makers and lawmakers, and from public services.</p><p>My reason for rejecting the Conservative motion is not about flexibility of approach. I do not always agree with what Annabel Goldie says, but I take on trust the sincerity with which she raised concerns about methadone. However, I believe that the approaches of \"zero tolerance\" and \"abstinence\", to which the motion refers, have been shown not to work, not only in this country but around the world. That is why I reject the Conservative motion.</p><p>The amendments all mention flexibility and taking different approaches and we should acknowledge that. The SNP amendment dismisses single, dogmatic solutions to a complex problem and calls for additional resources. Tommy Sheridan said that additional resources should be allocated to treatment and rehabilitation and that there should be a move away from the purely enforcement approach. I think that that is right.</p><p>I also think that politicians, not only here but at United Kingdom level, need to allocate far greater political priority and resources to tackling the production end of the problem. How many of us could honestly say that, if the choice that we were faced with was starvation for our families and violence from the local warlord versus producing poppies, we would not produce poppies? I do not know how many of us could say that. We need to <place-holder colnum=\"23851\"/> ensure that the poppy farmers can make other choices. I would support, in the short term, buying the stuff in order to destroy it, if that was about creating a long-term future for the farmers.</p><p>Far more has been said in the debate than I have time to respond to.

I also acknowledge that the damage that can be done to economies and local communities in a fairly short space of time&#8212;even a few months or years&#8212;can take generations to begin to heal. For those reasons, the SNP's amendment goes a little too far for my taste in attributing blame for past events rather than talking about the future, on which we should focus.</p><p>I argue that the future of regeneration, like the future of our society and economy more generally, must be grounded in sustainable development. I am disappointed that the report did not emphasise that more. As Karen Whitefield said, there needs to be a balance between different aspects of regeneration&#8212;physical, social, economic and environmental. Those aspects underpin sustainable development and must underpin our approach to regeneration. There are forms of development that harm communities. In some cases, that harm can be mitigated, so that it can be tolerated, but there are other forms of development for which we cannot find mitigation and that we simply should not pursue.</p><p>On the role of the private sector, I agree with the Executive's statement that the private sector has a vital role to play in regeneration. Almost everyone accepts that. However, I am pleased that the Executive is not relying absolutely on the PPP finance mechanism, because the case against it remains strong. I ask the minister in closing to say more about the criteria that he believes should apply. Where should PPP be thought of as appropriate and where should it not? In the private sector, there is a huge difference between the contribution that locally owned businesses can make to the regeneration of communities and local economies and the consequences of overreliance <place-holder colnum=\"23629\"/> on attracting external investment from big businesses, which by its nature is often temporary. The Executive is strongly reliant on gross domestic product as an economic indicator. I remind the minister that half of Scottish GDP is based on locally owned businesses, often family businesses.</p><p>In the short time that I have left, I will comment briefly on land issues. The Executive refers to the need to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Tackle land and property issues which can inhibit regeneration\".</p><p>As my colleagues and I have done on many previous occasions, I urge the Executive to remain open minded about the concept of land value taxation, which we support as an alternative to current local government finance and business rates. Even if it is just an additional, occasional tool in the box, it has huge potential to invigorate development of the kind that we support, in the locations that we support, and to contribute to the common good.</p><p>In closing, I emphasise the need for the balance about which Karen Whitefield and others have spoken. If we do not want money that we have put in to continue to leak out of communities, we must ensure that there is local ownership and vibrancy, not just physical regeneration.</p>", "hdate": "2006-03-01", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13356859", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Regeneration"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "We have just heard a balanced speech from the Labour back benches.

The Executive should be commended for reaching its recycling targets, but I am sceptical about whether it would have done so without people such as the community activists who got doorstep recycling projects up and running before anybody else caught up during the many years when recycling was recognised by few but the voluntary sector. Those activists are still diverting much waste from landfill. Many furniture recycling projects not only divert waste from landfill but ensure that, rather than junk them and buy new, we get more use out of our resources.</p><p>I also mentioned the volunteers in sexual health in the statutory sector and the voluntary sector whose work helps the Executive hit its targets and meet its sexual health strategy priorities.</p><p>I touched on youth work, which has far more to contribute to the Executive's antisocial behaviour agenda than is often acknowledged as it helps to develop young people as active citizens. The fact that volunteers and the voluntary sector do so much to help the Executive meet its targets should be acknowledged.

It is essential that they do not lose those qualities and the self-esteem that allows them to use them, regardless of whether they are granted asylum, refugee status or permission to stay. If they return to their country of origin, we have to equip them with the skills and ability to make a go of it. If they stay here, we want to ensure that they are able to contribute fully to our society, which many of them want passionately to do. I wish that we in this Parliament were able to give them the opportunity to work, but we can give them the opportunity to volunteer and make use of and expand their skills.</p><p>We also have to ensure that we give people the time and support to combine volunteering with a working life. I hope that the Executive is talking to its colleagues at Westminster about welfare reform. If we are looking&#8212;as we should&#8212;to encourage people to move into work if they are ready and able to after being on benefit for a long time, a stepping stone of volunteering can be of great use. I hope that the Westminster Government acknowledges that the gradual transition back into work should be supported.</p><p>I make no apology for mentioning the volunteers to whom I am closest, as I am sure are many members: the political party activists who are part of a vibrant volunteering democratic culture.

Punishment may have a role if it achieves something positive&#8212;if it changes someone's behaviour and makes them engage with the reasons why they offended in the first place. If it fails to do that, we need to think again: punishment is not an end in itself.

I met Sir John Orr during his review, and I have great sympathy for anyone who has to deal with this thorny issue. There is a need to ensure that the bill's provisions do not impact on political demonstrations, for instance. I would welcome an assurance that the Executive shares that concern and does not expect the provisions to do so. I also seek reassurance on the time limits. Last-minute approval for a march or demonstration can be problematic for the organisers. If organisers have to give 28 days' notice, it seems only reasonable that local authorities should carry out their negotiations in a reasonable period. Last-minute permission is not reasonable if a long period of notice has been given. I wonder whether that can be addressed in guidance.</p><p>On the powers in relation to suspects, I share Stewart Maxwell's concern about the proposed power to take fingerprints using hand-held <place-holder colnum=\"23061\"/> devices, and I look forward to hearing the Executive's response on that.</p><p>Mandatory drug testing is one of the issues on which we always have difficulty in balancing different human rights. Mandatory testing is about gaining information, and the justification for it is the use to which that information will be put. If it is used to increase the likelihood that someone will accept treatment and support, I can accept and agree to mandatory testing. However, it will do that successfully only if testing leads quickly to assessment and if assessment leads quickly to treatment. Also, mandatory testing must not result in a shortage of treatment places in some areas for people who enter the system other than as suspects of crime.</p><p>Another recent idea is mandatory testing for HIV and hepatitis C. I am glad that that proposal is not included in the bill, as it fails the test that I have just said mandatory drug testing should pass. The information that would be gained would put at risk the suspect's emotional and physical health and would offer no genuine benefit to the other people involved, even if there was reason to fear a risk of infection. I understand that the Executive has talked about pursuing the proposal through a working group.

On every occasion on which we debated the issue, I explained my reservations and concerns and I emphasised that I commended the Executive for taking the issue seriously and for giving it priority. However, I felt that the bill took the wrong approach. I argued that positive interventions should take priority: I argued for reinvigorating our approach to youth work, for reform of the children's hearings system, and for a review of social work. I also argued that such preventive measures should take priority, rather than the enforcement measures that dominated the bill.</p><p>However, the bill took the focus that it did and contained enforcement measures such as antisocial behaviour orders for under-16s. The following figures are from November, so they may be slightly out of date. There were two antisocial behaviour orders for under-16s, no parenting orders and one restriction of liberty order for an under-16. The measures were introduced by the 2004 act and were talked up as being an important part of the solution to a problem that was described as afflicting communities the length and breadth of the country. It is clear that enforcement orders were not the solution&#8212;they are not being taken up. Members are talking about success and about improvements, but those improvements are not the result of a widespread use of enforcement orders.</p><p>Maggie Mellon of Children 1<sup>st</sup> summed it up best when she said that many of the enforcement mechanisms are not the appropriate way forward because relationships are not amenable to orders. We must affect relationships if we want to change behaviour rather than move it. Many of the measures, including enforcement, have a role, but enforcement should not be the position to which we leap automatically. Technological solutions such as electronic tags and closed-circuit television have a role in limited circumstances, but they can be a knee-jerk reaction. Instead of CCTV, we should examine lighting, streetscaping and the many other options that can be more effective at changing behaviour. Such solutions are not subject to the kind of intrusive abuse to which CCTV, for example, has been south of the border.</p><p>In all honesty, I hope that I am wrong and that the use of enforcement measures, even in a limited number of cases, is effective. I hope that we come to the next election without the ratcheted-up respect agenda from the Executive parties that we have seen down south.

There is a debate about the current settlement and the circumstances in which local government finds itself. There is also a debate about the longer-term future of local government finance.</p><p>I will try to address my remarks to both crucial issues. I begin by acknowledging the impressive performance of John Swinney in his opening speech, in which he urged the Executive to seize the opportunity to address both issues. Not only did he highlight the current situation and the possibility of substantial council tax increases in the short term, but he argued clearly and strongly for replacement of the council tax. Mr Swinney's exchange with George Lyon was an absolute joy to behold. Some observers may have been taken aback by some of Mr Lyon's attempts at verbal gymnastics, even if he wobbled off the mat once or twice, but Mr Swinney cut through that and exposed clearly the inadequacy of the list of could-haves and might-have-beens that we heard.</p><p>As a stranger to finance debates in the chamber, I am happy to admit freely that the blizzard of statistics one way and the other holds little attraction for me. However, there have been moments of clarity between those exchanges. It <place-holder colnum=\"22285\"/> seems clear that, over recent years, more resources have been made available to local authorities, but that those have not been sufficient to take account of the dramatic rise in the number of duties and the increased workload that we are placing on local authorities. They are also not enough to prevent the dramatic rises in council tax that many members anticipate.</p><p>David Davidson's remarks were largely a defence of the council tax system, which he would like to continue, albeit with a few tweaks. However, many members have addressed the substantial injustice that is associated with the existing system. Tommy Sheridan spoke about the constraints on local authorities&#8212;not only the new duties that they must carry out but the pressure to make cuts and efficiency savings, to restrain council tax and to use systems such as the dire PPP funding arrangements. I have no doubt that, in the long run, PPP will be judged a wildly expensive folly. It is very sad that the Executive remains wedded to it.</p><p>Fergus Ewing's contribution was entertaining. He quoted from a range of sources such as Ira Gershwin, Deep Throat and Anne Robinson. However, he used his quotes from Mr Lyon most effectively. He made clear, as Mr Swinney did, that a could-have-been&#8212;even a should-have-been&#8212;is not enough to satisfy us that money saved through efficiency savings has been available to local authority budgets and has been spent on more and better services.</p><p>Bristow Muldoon devoted many of his remarks to the virtues of efficiency. On one level, I agree with his repeated assertion that there is no organisation in the world that cannot improve what it does and the way in which it does that by becoming more efficient and saving money. However, he acknowledged implicitly that the reality will involve some cuts in services. When he said that efficiency saving is not all about cuts, he sounded a little defensive.</p>", "hdate": "2006-01-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13353336", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Local Government Finance"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Mark Ballard's opening speech reflected on the dual nature of the debate.

The motion acknowledges that a range of factors, including nutrition, exercise, and clothing, need to be taken into account. However, all members will recognise that fuel poverty, although not the only factor, is of central importance.</p><p>The reasons why we need to reduce demand for energy are many and varied, but they include fuel poverty. We have some level of control over, and some ability to influence, energy efficiency but that is really the only factor by which we can influence fuel poverty. We cannot do much about energy prices, which we know will continue to rise throughout this century as the period of cheap energy&#8212;the fantasy of cheap energy&#8212;comes to an end. We will see much higher energy prices for all types of energy demand, but fuel for the home will certainly be affected. If we do nothing to reduce energy demand, fuel poverty will continue.</p><p>Other reasons for reducing energy demand include climate change, security of supply and, of course, the fact that controversy accompanies virtually every form of energy generation. Whether energy is generated by, in my view, aesthetically beautiful wind farms or nasty ugly nuclear power plants&#8212;whatever side of the line members fall on in that debate&#8212;energy generation is, we all recognise, a difficult thing to get support for.</p><p>Given all those reasons for reducing energy demand, how can we do that? There are many ways of reducing demand, some of which the Executive is working on. Having been accused by the Deputy Minister for Communities of lacking Christmas spirit in yesterday's debate because I would not applaud the work that is being done, let me say that this Tiny Tim is full of Christmas spirit and is happy to agree that much of the Executive's work is heading in the right direction. The reasons for my criticism yesterday were that progress should be faster and greater and is currently too slow.<place-holder colnum=\"21854\"/></p><p>If we are to put in place the housing and energy supply that will enable people to live without fuel poverty and to heat their homes properly in a period of high energy prices, we need to get that stuff physically in place as soon as possible. We need to do that before the problem becomes extreme, but that is already starting to happen.</p><p>On that note, I commend to members Shiona Baird's proposal for a member's bill on micro-renewable power. Her proposals would offer individual householders a rebate from their council tax for the installation of the kit, and, over the years, they would contribute to the energy supply for our country and see a reduction in their household fuel bills. Although the Executive is talking about a pilot scheme including some form of micro-renewables alongside the central heating programme, that pilot will take some time to establish what we already know&#8212;that micro-renewables are a necessary part of the solution. Shiona Baird's proposal for a member's bill goes much further. I encourage all members to read the consultation and to contribute positively to it.</p><p>I was interested to hear Paul Martin's remarks on street-level targeting of local areas.

Annabel Goldie, who has left the chamber, was also there and both of us felt that the seminar was very interesting. The co-director of the centre stated in a recent speech:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am concerned that criminal justice is becoming too much a surrogate for effective social policy and that, as a consequence, the shortcomings of ... government are being visited on already multiply disadvantaged people in the form of punishment.\"</p><p>The essential message of the seminar was that if we look at the geography of punishment&#8212;not where offences are committed, but where the people come from who are imprisoned&#8212;we see that very small areas receive vast amounts of <place-holder colnum=\"21559\"/> money in the form of spending on imprisonment, on which huge amounts of Government money are spent. Those small areas, however, are also the recipients of disproportionately large amounts of money on other services, including benefits, free school meals and social work case loads. Vast amounts of money are poured into those areas, but no strategic view is formed of how the money affects the area. In fact, although each service may act rationally on its own terms, some of the services may work against the overall objectives of others. In the long run, perhaps we must consider whether, in effect, we have a policy of removals and return: X number of young men are taken out of and put back into the same communities. That has a negative impact in the long run.</p><p>Bill Butler said that sentencing must never compromise public safety. He is right, of course, but at some point we must ask whether prison compromises public safety. Again, I quote the co-director of the Glasgow centre for the study of violence, who states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"it is misleading to suggest that by placing someone in prison, you are protecting the public in the long run. You are harming the individual and you are lowering the probability of their surviving legitimately in the community.\"</p><p>John Swinney said that he wants to see offenders' behaviour being challenged effectively. I was pleased that he ended his speech with that sentiment, because it would be far too easy simply to call for longer sentences. I hope that he agrees that if the first 18-month sentence had been served in full, the offender that he mentioned may have been no less likely to go out and commit another offence simply because they had served more time in prison.

Her amendment 85 calls for a strategy, something to which the Executive is already committed. My amendment would insert into the bill statutory targets for improvements in energy efficiency. Statutory targets are the key point that we should be addressing.</p><p>The main difference between amendment 1 and the amendment that the Communities Committee rejected at stage 2 is that the stage 2 amendment contained a secondary target for further improvements on home energy efficiency by 2020. I have removed that, so I am giving the Parliament the opportunity to vote today on the single target on its own.</p><p>Statutory targets are the meat of the issue. Other legislatures in Europe, including Westminster, have acknowledged the need to include statutory targets in legislation on this subject to ensure that there is a deadline for Government to live up to. To agree an amendment without statutory targets would fall short of a half-measure.</p><p>On Frances Curran's amendments to my amendment, I am honestly not sure how necessary amendments 1C and 1D are, but they seem to add, rather than detract, so I would be happy for them to go through. The Communities Committee has already rejected the secondary target that I proposed, and that is unlikely to change today. I am keen that we have the opportunity to vote on the first target alone. I therefore do not intend to support Frances Curran's amendments 1A and 1B.</p><p>I know that the Conservative group is particularly concerned about the cost of the measures that we propose. There will of course be a short-term cost to society in becoming more energy efficient. The savings come later. In these times, when all the <place-holder colnum=\"21165\"/> talk is of an energy gap and fans of nuclear power, including the Conservatives, are calling for new build, the task of preparing our society for the energy problems that we will face in the coming century will have a cost. We can choose to pay the immense financial, social and environmental cost of the nuclear option, or of runaway climate change, or we can choose as a society to pay the lower cost in all three senses of preparing ourselves for the dramatic reduction in the use of energy that will be required of us.</p><p>For generations we have been living with the delusion that energy is a cheap commodity and building the domestic equivalent of gas-guzzling four-by-fours. To focus only on the need to keep the lights burning is as short-sighted as the road fuel lobby's demand for an absolute right to keep putting cheap petrol in their tanks.</p><p>The transition that will be forced on our society one way or the other can be sudden, dramatic and traumatic or we can rouse ourselves from the fantasy of cheap energy and start laying the foundations of a society that can offer a high quality of life to all without living beyond our ecological means.</p><p>I would describe that as a Green society, but, whatever political interpretation one offers, we must all recognise the challenge that lies before us. Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative MPs at Westminster have recognised that challenge by supporting similar measures to include statutory targets in their legislation.</p><p>I welcomed the SNP's support at stage 2 and I hope that it will support my amendment 1 today. I sincerely hope also that members of other parties will see that firm, clear statutory targets are a step in not just the right direction, but the only direction that we will be able to take.

It has taken me about two and a half years as a member of the Scottish Parliament to get a members' business debate, so I have had a long time to pick a topic. I decided to debate air pollution in Glasgow for a number of reasons&#8212;partly because of the issue's importance and partly because of its timeliness.</p><p>One of the positive aspects of having regional MSPs in addition to constituency MSPs is that it should drag us towards a regional focus&#8212;that is my view; others might take a different view. Air pollution in Glasgow affects not only those who live in the city centre but those who work, socialise and shop there, enjoying what is an increasingly attractive city. In short, it affects millions of people across the region and beyond.</p><p>The air pollution in our city is one of the things that is undermining the attractiveness of Glasgow as a place to spend time, socialise, live, work and bring up children. If we are ambitious for our city&#8212;and for other cities that suffer from high levels of air pollution&#8212;we should not ignore the importance of improving the environment in which our citizens live their lives.</p><p>I have chosen to debate this issue now partly because of the decisive action that the Parliament and the Executive have taken on the pollution that fills our lungs when we are indoors by introducing a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces. The <place-holder colnum=\"20420\"/> ban will come into force in a few months. Once it does, a bizarre situation will emerge in which I and other Glaswegians will be able to sup a pint in our favourite pub while breathing clean air but will expose ourselves to danger when we step outside into what can no longer be called fresh air. For example, stepping out of a pub in Hope Street will be to step into the worst air pollution crisis in the country.</p><p>It should be clear to us all that, in historical terms, big improvements have been made in air quality. However, it should be equally clear that those improvements have been driven by technology. The principle is straightforward: although improvements in technology are valuable, in short order, they will be overtaken by increasing traffic levels. I believe that Glasgow has already passed the point at which increasing traffic levels overtake the improvements in air quality that come from technology. In time, the rest of Scotland will experience that. If we place our trust only in the technological fix, we risk losing the improvements in air quality that we have seen in previous decades.</p><p>Members might recall a recent campaign by Scottish Environment LINK that involved postcards with an image of a car and the message that the rear end kills far more people than the front end. In fact, it is estimated that the exhaust pipe is responsible for five times more deaths than any other part of the car. In Scotland, around 2,000 deaths a year have been estimated to be attributable to air pollution, and traffic exhaust fumes are the overwhelming cause of that pollution. That is an intolerable number of deaths, but we must not forget the additional health consequences that, although they are less serious and are not fatal, impair many people's quality of life.</p><p>What is Glasgow City Council doing about it? Because the pollution levels are so high, it designated the city centre as an air quality management area and produced an air quality action plan, with a particular focus on nitrogen dioxide. The production of the plan is a legal requirement. It specifies the measures that will be taken but, unfortunately, it does not specify measures that will address the cause of the problem, which is the rising level of road traffic.</p><p>The Executive predicts that Glasgow can look forward to continued and dramatic increases in road traffic levels. To put it simply, unless the situation is turned around, we will have no reason to hope that Glasgow's air quality will somehow magically transform.</p><p>In the past&#8212;and today&#8212;I have been accused of not giving the Executive credit for its spending on public transport, so I will do that now. We like spending on public transport. It is a good thing. <place-holder colnum=\"20421\"/></p><p>We want more of it. Well done for what has been done. However, the objective should be nothing less than a modal shift away from the car and on to public transport for as many journeys as possible. If we have better public transport and rising traffic levels, we will still have chronic air pollution problems in places such as Glasgow, not to mention the contribution that that makes to climate change. Scottish ministers must sit down with councils, such as Glasgow City Council, that are not meeting the Executive's targets on air pollution and consider what measures are necessary to bring traffic levels down to improve air quality in the long run and to bring it up to the Executive's targets, to ensure that Glaswegians of the future have air that is fit to breathe.</p><p>When addressing the chamber this afternoon, the President of Malawi told us that a healthy population is a prerequisite for wealth creation. That principle applies all over the world. In the case of Glasgow, inequalities in health and wealth are equally serious concerns. Air pollution affects everyone in Glasgow, but I fear that its most serious impact will be on people living in poverty. The Executive accepts the principle of environmental justice and the link between pollution and poverty, so it should investigate the risk that the health effects of on-going problems with air pollution may compound the health consequences of poor housing, bad diet and smoking, and thus impact most heavily on people in poverty.</p><p>I thank members for staying.

Members might be confused by the fact that, in a debate on freedom of information, I mention not only a quantum physicist but one who was dead long before the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 came into force. However, I mention him because one of his best-known achievements is the development of the idea that it not possible to observe a system without altering it.</p><p>Heisenberg argued that that is true at the quantum level, where the presence of a photon can affect the energy of a subatomic particle. If he were here, he would probably agree that the principle is far more powerfully demonstrated in the case of the Scottish Parliament allowances office and the many other institutions that have been coping with large numbers of FOI requests. Our effort to make information clear and to allow systems to be observed is having an impact on them.</p><p>If the reports that we have read today are even vaguely true&#8212;that the capacity of an office can be taken up for as long as nine months in responding to requests for information under the 2002 act, the consequence might be not only to affect the system but to prevent it from doing what it is there to do. The legislation might itself end up being the cause of a great many of the problems that could ultimately get reported on as news.<place-holder colnum=\"20213\"/></p><p>FOI is an important principle, but we must be clear about exactly why it is important and what kind of impact we want it to have on the systems that people in Scotland have a right to observe and scrutinise. The Minister for Parliamentary Business made it clear that she regards FOI as being about openness, transparency and the individual citizen having a right to information on decisions affecting their lives and on how those decisions are made. Is the FOI legislation achieving that purpose? Has that been its effect? I am sure that it was never intended for any allowances office or other part of the public sector to be prevented from operating normally as a result of the legislation.</p><p>What can we do to ensure that the effect of the rights that the act gives is the one that we want to achieve? First, we must acknowledge that the act is being used by a large number of people in the way that was intended. Individual citizens, campaign groups and investigative journalists are using it for good purposes in holding public bodies to account.</p><p>Secondly, we need to ensure that those public bodies that are subject to the act are geared up to respond. I am aware of at least one open-source software company in Scotland that is designing tools specifically to help the public sector to respond to large volumes of FOI requests, to track their progress and to ensure that they are answered on time. We also need to ensure that we are publishing information that might be subject to FOI routinely, as we see the SPCB is considering doing. Routine FOI requests could be answered more simply by pointing to information that is already available.</p><p>Thirdly, we should be looking to broaden the scope of the legislation to all organisations that provide public services. I was recently looking again at George Monbiot's book \"Captive State\", which I first read a number of years ago, and his investigation into the issues to do with PPP. Given the fact that many members have had a long interest in those issues, I think that if all organisations providing public services were subject to FOI, a much stronger case could be made not just on George Monbiot's side of the argument, but on both sides of the argument. There would be better-informed debate&#8212;I think that Fergus Ewing alluded to the need for informed debate instead of impaired debate. Subjecting other organisations to FOI would be a step forward.</p><p>I congratulate members who were here in the first session to pass the 2002 act, but I hope that, as Kenny MacAskill said, the review takes us forward, not back.</p>", "hdate": "2005-11-02", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13347963", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Freedom of Information"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Perhaps puzzlingly, I will begin by saying something about Werner Heisenberg.

It was perhaps slightly lost in the hubbub at the time, so let me repeat it: homelessness is a phenomenon that should not occur in a modern society. We should reflect on that, as it is quite a powerful thing to say. I repeat: homelessness should not occur in a modern society.</p><p>As Karen Whitefield mentioned, the aspirations of the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003 were substantial. It sought to abolish homelessness and to ensure that homelessness does not occur in this modernised society. That is a tough call that does not come easy or cheap. I defy any member to say that any party would have declined the opportunity to abolish homelessness if it were easy or cheap to do so.<place-holder colnum=\"20134\"/></p><p>I share Tricia Marwick's keenness for the ministerial statement, but I accept that it will come. I also share the aspirations that exist among the many organisations that have sent us briefings. The Scottish Council for Single Homeless has stated that the 2012 target</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is not only the right approach, but also achievable and practical.\"</p><p>That does not mean that the target will be cheap or easy, but it is achievable and practical if the political will exists.</p><p>Johann Lamont described the requirement to abolish priority need as being about creating a fair and equal Scotland. We should agree not only that the measure is worth while, but that the Executive is right not to avoid it&#8212;as Johann Lamont said, we should not put it into the box marked \"too difficult\". In the context of the Executive's wider work on poverty&#8212;for example, on child poverty&#8212;we need to recognise that poverty among single adults is on the increase, and homelessness is part of that picture. Obviously, there must be a balance between meeting the needs of homeless people and meeting other people's needs. As other members have observed, if we are to be able eventually to meet everyone's housing needs, supply is a crucial issue.</p><p>I will make a couple of quick comments about the right to buy. Increasingly, members accept that, although the right to buy may have had a positive impact on some individuals and their families and households, it has had a profoundly negative impact on society as a whole. The case not only for reviewing the right to buy, but for allowing that review to lead to its abolition, is growing in strength.</p><p>Some people have suggested that the need for more new-build social rented housing is an argument for closing the door on a third-party right of appeal in the planning process. I want to make a quick point about that. It is not a planning point, but a point about the status of social rented housing. Let us accept&#8212;as I think members are beginning to do&#8212;that there has been a shift towards owner occupation and an increase in its status, that there is an increasing perception that the aspiration to owner occupation is the only valid one and that the right to buy is part of that shift. If we allow social rented housing to be classed with all the most unpopular planning developments in Scotland and to be pushed through in the same way as opencast coal mines, landfill sites and other unpopular developments, do we not underline its low status in society? If we want to change that status, should we not accept that we need to provide leadership in the communities where objections may be raised, to prevent those objections from being raised and to tackle them head on, rather than simply allowing them not to <place-holder colnum=\"20135\"/> have any impact on decisions in the planning system?</p><p>I want quickly to mention support services. A while ago, 7:84 brought a theatre group to the Parliament and gave a performance, which several members who are in the chamber attended. Two themes were highlighted by the group of homeless and ex-homeless people who took part in it. The first was the fact that is very easy for people to become homeless. Homeless people are not some alien group&#8212;in different circumstances, any of us could find ourselves in that situation. I was glad that Johann Lamont made that point in her opening speech. Secondly, homeless people have on-going and complex support needs. It is a question not just of providing places to live, but of providing support to people so that they can carry on living there.</p><p>It is not only the role of government to provide on-going support&#8212;there is a huge amount that voluntary organisations and social enterprises can do. I encourage members to reflect on the value of my favourite, <em>The Big Issue in Scotland</em>. It is not just a magazine that has my ugly mug in it every week. A huge amount of work is being done in the organisation to support homeless people and people who are coming out of homelessness.</p>", "hdate": "2005-10-27", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13347853", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Homelessness"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Euan Robson opened his speech with a very simple statement.

One of the things that the summer academy gets right is that it tries to achieve that objective in a way that does not just provide a tokenistic approach for young people from a particular geographic area or type of school or background. It tries hard to create a social and cultural mix in the groups with which it works, which is very important.</p><p>The international mix adds to that. Bill Butler mentioned Spain, Sweden, Holland and Germany&#8212;I might have missed one&#8212;as well as the initiative at the University of Barcelona. I am very interested in that because I was in Barcelona on Friday for a conference. I happened to have with me as some of my travel reading a little history of Scottish universities. I did not finish it, so perhaps I am not as good a student as I might be, but Scottish universities have a long-standing tradition of being more accessible and of involving <place-holder colnum=\"20023\"/> not just people from a narrow social background.

Education's purpose should not just be about what the economy or industry needs; it should not just be about training people up for the jobs market. It is about creating and shaping a culture and about fostering a creative, capable and purposeful citizenry that is aware of its aspirations and able to meet them. An education system that achieves that will make efforts to break down the barriers that exist between educational institutions, and that exist between those institutions and wider society.

One is that the bill provided an opportunity to take a more surefooted step forward. The bill is a step forward, but it could have been better. It could have been a useful vehicle for levelling up work on the various equality strands and the legislation that affects different groups. UK ministers have indicated that they are open to doing that at some point in the next few years, but we do not know when.</p><p>The hierarchy of equalities that exists can be seen in other areas, such as the proposed incitement to hatred legislation. I have an instinctive concern about censorship and free speech, but a strong case can be made for having a general incitement to hatred offence.

I do not want more communities to have to go through another stage of involvement with the planning system if it only makes them feel stressed and defeated and has the same outcome. I support third-party right of appeal as a way of giving developers and local planning authorities an incentive to get involvement right, because that will give them the incentive to avoid the appeals stage altogether. At the moment, local planning authorities have an incentive only to avoid developers' appeals. Because they feel that they do not have the capacity to deal with appeals, local authorities grant consent for planning applications that they do not want to consent to.</p><p>As far as the national planning framework is concerned, although there are good reasons for having such a measure, we must not use it as a means of locking people out of a further tranche of developments.<place-holder colnum=\"19717\"/></p><p>I do not have time to develop the argument, but we must have meaningful public scrutiny.

The Communities Committee, the Enterprise and Culture Committee, the Local Government and Transport Committee, the Environment and Rural Development Committee and any other committee that is in any way connected with planning must be involved in this process. We must have a long period of thoughtful and critical analysis that involves outside experts. After all, no MSP can be expected to be an expert on every planning matter. Outside experts advise our committees on the budget process and we need the same approach in examining the planning system.</p><p>Sustainable development is not just jargon.

Of course, I was not the only politician to go there last week&#8212;not all went through the same door. I went to see the governor and to be given a tour of the education and rehabilitation services, because I had heard from colleagues in the justice field that what was happening at <place-holder colnum=\"19614\"/> Edinburgh was particularly impressive&#8212;and so it was.</p><p>I had flagged up to me some of the behavioural problems of the younger men who were graduating&#8212;if we can use that term&#8212;from the youth justice system into the adult criminal justice system. Some of those problems were linked not only to the men's imprisonment and their offending behaviour, but&#8212;crucially&#8212;to bereavement. I was told that behavioural issues linked to bereavement and parental addiction were becoming huge problems. I asked the natural question: what is society doing to prevent such problems for the next generation? After the briefest of pauses while they glanced at each other, the two people to whom I was speaking said, \"Nothing.\" That reply might be a bit of an overstatement, but it is clear from the people to whom we all speak as MSPs and from the committee's work that we are not nearly doing enough. Without those vital services, no enforcement, preventive order or punishment will ever be effective in the long run in dealing with a problem that many people throughout Scotland have to put up with. The young people who are now being electronically tagged and receiving ASBOs&#8212;such as the person to whom Hugh Henry referred&#8212;were toddlers when the enforcement-led approach that ASBOs represent was first put on the table. How well have we served them since then? To what extent have we ensured that they have been able to fulfil their potential to grow and thrive? I believe that they have been failed.</p><p>I became a member of the Parliament in 2003 and immediately had the delight of serving on the Communities Committee and dealing with the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill. At the time, I argued that the order of priorities was wrong. I did not argue that all the wrong things were being done; my view was that things were being done in the wrong order. Our first job should have been to consider what Hugh Henry described as positive interventions. We should then have worked out what we could do to reinforce, strengthen and reform the existing systems, such as the children's hearings system, to make them better able to do their job. After that, it would have been clear what the necessary new enforcement measures would be. However, exactly the opposite approach was taken and the new enforcement measures are now in place. I hope that those measures will help, but I doubt that they will do anything to address the problem in the long term until the issues that the committee's report addresses are given greater priority.</p><p>The minister said that his starting point is to put the young person at the centre of the Executive's approach. However, it is interesting that he talked about young people after they had become young <place-holder colnum=\"19615\"/> offenders. The starting point should be the children who are being born today. We know that having high-quality child care and nurseries, parents who have the time and support to be as good parents as they can be, good diets, youth work provision and high-quality play spaces help to prevent young people from becoming involved in low-level offending behaviour. Those things should be our starting point.</p><p>We have distinctive structures, historical factors and institutions in Scotland and we have the opportunity to take a distinctive approach that recognises children's rights, which Stewart Stevenson mentioned. Those rights are enshrined in documents such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. As was said in a debate last week, the United Kingdom Government does not always take such an approach.</p><p>In politics, what everybody thinks is important is not necessarily what is important. Health is a good example. People think that health is a big election issue, but it is not. The treatment of illness and ill health and the potential loss of hospitals are big issues, but health is about matters such as junk food, lack of exercise and high-stress lifestyles&#8212;things that do not have a high political priority. With respect to crime, prevention and rehabilitation are difficult to sell&#8212;a headline about being tough on crime is always more appealing. Children should be society's highest priority, but we are failing to do what is in their best interests. I add with regret that police officers are now receiving calls in Scotland not about young people being rowdy or offending on the streets, but about their being on the streets at all. A society that considers that to be a problem has got its priorities wrong.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-29", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13346424", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Stewart Stevenson told us that he is a grumpy old man today.

The United Reform Church, the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church have added their voices.</p><p>Is there any sphere of life in which this situation would be acceptable? We have seen behaviour that falls short of what we expect in a civilised society. I am pleased that, after today's debate, we will be able to say that the Parliament did not remain silent. We have added our voices to the necessary outcry about the harm that is being inflicted on children and their families in Scotland. What matters next is that action is taken. We want to give the fullest possible emphasis to our devolved responsibilities for child welfare.</p><p>I am sorry that I will not have time to mention everyone who spoke, but I want to thank some members in particular.</p><p>Robert Brown said that we are discussing an issue on the border between devolved and reserved institutions and he was right to say that we should have the confidence to debate it. However, it is not only the issue but the children themselves who are being sent across the border. Asylum policy is the UK's responsibility, but if removals are being carried out in a manner that we do not think meets our standards of welfare, our responsibility does not evaporate.</p><p>Christine Grahame said that what is being done is too little, too late, that we have heard the Executive's words before and that we need action. <place-holder colnum=\"19394\"/></p><p>I agree, but I am glad that the Executive has gone further than it has in the past. It is more important now to continue to press ministers on the what, when and how of the commitments that they have made today than it is to lament what was not done in the past.</p><p>Mary Scanlon focused on the practices used and acknowledged that they are unnecessary. I hope that Mary Scanlon will consider supporting the Green motion, which specifically says that the practices are unnecessary. She also mentioned the education of the children of asylum seekers. Surely we all acknowledge that the Vucaj children were getting their education in Drumchapel High School and that they should go back there.</p><p>Jeremy Purvis applauded Robert Brown's constructive approach in previous debates. I hope that members will agree that the Greens have taken a similarly constructive approach. He mentioned the robustness of the Executive's position.

We must hear concrete commitments to action rather than caveats about UK responsibilities. However, I share Bill Butler's hope that today's debate will lead to stronger action.</p><p>Donald Gorrie spoke of this Parliament's growing maturity. He is right to mention that, but the Vucaj children and others cannot wait long for us to find our maturity. The experiences that they have gone through have meant that they have had to grow up fast and so must we.</p><p>I thank the Executive and the SNP for lodging amendments that are in keeping with the spirit in which we brought this debate to the chamber. We understand that this is not an issue that should divide us on party lines. Of course, the parties have different positions on asylum policy. Too often, UK ministers use words such as \"robust\" and \"control\" when they are talking about asylum policy.

In this debate, that <place-holder colnum=\"19260\"/> is my position. I make that case with mixed feelings following an event that I attended last night. At a time when human rights in our society are being given a bad name, I hosted an event, in a room just around the corner, as the convener of the cross-party group on human rights: the Amnesty International human rights media awards. However, I was embarrassed to see that no other member of the Scottish Parliament was present at that successful event, which celebrated the work of journalists in Scotland who support human rights. It was embarrassing to have to admit that this Parliament appears to place little value on human rights.</p><p>In many debates on justice, a clear, sharp line is imagined between victims and offenders, with the Executive keen to present itself as being on the side of the victim. Of course we should be on the side of the victim but we should also have the courage to say that we are on the side of everyone whose interests we represent. Does inhumane and degrading treatment give offenders the best chance of changing their behaviour for the better?

We have heard similar concerns today from the Justice 1 Committee and I repeat those concerns now.</p><p>The issues that the bill addresses are complex. The committee report describes the bill as \"disparate\" and says that it was difficult for the committee to identify the basic principles that we are here to debate. However, I think that some simple principles should underlie our approach to the subject. Some people would prefer family law to be based on a set of unchanging, absolute truths, which I believe are irrelevant in a modern society. The social change that has occurred in recent decades, to which Mike Pringle referred, has had mixed consequences, of course, but the <place-holder colnum=\"19131\"/> changes have been overwhelmingly positive and family law must keep up with the situation.</p><p>Some people argue that accepting any change to family law will undermine marriage. The phrase \"undermine marriage\" crops up often&#8212;it has done so a couple of times today&#8212;but it is an idea that, honestly, I have never fully got my head round. If I treat my fellow citizens with respect, that does not undermine my status as a citizen. If I value the skills and abilities of my colleagues, that does not lessen the value of my skills and abilities, however different they might be. I like to think that I treat even my fellow MSPs with respect and I hope that that does not undermine my ability to do a decent job. Respecting and legally recognising different forms of relationships and family in society undermines nobody's relationship. It could undermine the idea that one family is better than another. However, we should undermine the idea that one loving and committed relationship is superior to another. We should get rid of that idea completely. Love is love; commitment is commitment; and all families are due respect.</p><p>Marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute should be done away with, if for no other reason than the fact that its name is far too complicated. When I was working on the issue of civil partnership during the early months of this session, I met many mixed-sex couples who came out to me as bidie-ins or as having a common-law marriage. They told me many things about how their relationship was perceived by other people and by the state. It is right that the situation should be cleared up with regard not only to the law, but to people's perceptions.</p><p>The Deputy Minister for Justice recognised that people have various views about divorce. Some people are opposed to it in principle while others are not. That is precisely why the law has to give people the freedom to act on their own terms. Some people would not pursue divorce out of principle but, for others, a formally recognised relationship is a purely personal matter and is not the business of people and institutions other than themselves and the state. People have to be free to act in the interests of their family, on their own terms, if their relationship breaks down.</p><p>As Couple Counselling Scotland and Family Mediation Scotland observed earlier this week in a briefing session to MSPs, divorce is not, by definition, the end of all family relationships. Parents remain parents and children remain children. It is important to support couples who choose to stay together, but we also need to provide support to those couples who have no option but to separate. If we provide that support to them, they will be better able to remain active parents who can support their children.</p>", "hdate": "2005-09-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13345311", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Family Law (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "During the short period of time that I have been a member of the Scottish Parliament, I have spoken to what seems to be an increasing number of members who have expressed concerns about the time that is available to them to do their work as well as they are capable of doing it.

I am sure that many issues will be raised that well deserve to be on the agenda. In the debate on those issues, a response is demanded to recent high-profile and shocking events, to which Jeremy Purvis and others referred. The First Minister is right to say that we must learn lessons from those events. However, learning lessons is not the same as allowing our approach to be driven by those cases. Clearly, if someone poses a risk to the public, it might be dangerous to grant them bail. However, bail exists for good reasons and it would equally be wrong to place individuals on remand who do not need to be there simply because of a feeling that something must be done.</p><p>I was, therefore, a little disappointed by the First Minister's response to Mr McLetchie's question on that issue. I did not hear a robust and solid defence of the place of human rights in our society. We had to wait until Pauline McNeill spoke&#8212;and she did so very well&#8212;to hear a solid defence of human rights.</p><p>Human rights are a basis of a modern democracy. They have repeatedly come under threat, not only from those in the Conservative party who regret the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998, but from the UK Government and other Governments. That is why the move towards a Scottish commission for human rights is so important. It is a move for which we have been waiting for some time. I congratulate the Liberal Democrats on whatever influence they have brought to bear. I welcome the fact that we will see the commission established through this year's legislative programme&#8212;and, incidentally, I think <place-holder colnum=\"18839\"/> that MSPs need an independent source of advice on the legislation that comes before us.</p><p>In his statement, the First Minister implied a moving away from a narrow comparison with England and Wales; he talked about Scotland in relation to the rest of the world. I ask the Deputy Minister for Justice whether, in his closing speech, he can confirm that the Scottish human rights commission will conform to the highest international standards for such organisations, will report to the Parliament rather than to the Executive and will have the power to take cases on behalf of individuals and groups in society. I also ask him to say something about the resources that the commission will have to do its work.</p><p>Another important body that the Justice Department will be working on during the coming year is the police complaints commission. That commission was promised in the partnership agreement; again, I congratulate the Liberal Democrats on whatever influence they have brought to bear. I hope that the commission will be all that it can be. Recent events in London have shown the pressing demand for truly independent scrutiny of complaints about the police. The commitment in the partnership agreement to create an independent police complaints commission appears to be a little stronger than what we heard from the First Minister, who spoke about introducing an \"element\" of independence into the police complaints system.

Climate change, recycling and the protection of small fluffy animals do not often fall within my remit, even though I am happy to admit that I am one of the smallest and fluffiest members of my party.</p><p>The bill offers an opportunity to address a theme&#8212;waste of resources&#8212;that is familiar to people who mistake the Greens for a single-issue pressure group. I will talk first about energy efficiency, which is the most obvious aspect of waste of resources that is addressed in the bill. Through walls, windows, doors and roofs, Scotland's homes are leaking energy that costs householders money and which has costs for environment both locally and globally. Overconsumption of energy does not get enough press and when we talk about the so-called energy gap we often talk only about generation of energy. Scotland is by no means the only country that is guilty of overconsumption and waste of energy, but we must address the problem rationally.</p><p>Some provisions in the bill relate to energy efficiency, but the committee heard evidence from some witnesses that, for example, the national home energy rating of 2 represents for most homes no great hurdle to overcome, so surely we can be more ambitious. The committee thinks so and calls not only for a national target for improved energy efficiency by a specified date, but for the tolerable standard to address more than just insulation and to address overall energy performance. That would take account of environmental concerns, but would also address the hugely important problem of fuel poverty, which is of real concern to the Executive. I hope that ministers will use the warm summer months to consider carefully what more can be done.</p><p>The second wasted resource is homes themselves. I refer members to the briefing from Shelter Scotland on empty and derelict homes. We need to build more affordable homes in many parts of the country. The Executive's target is 5,000 homes a year throughout Scotland, but many thousands of homes are left unlived in&#8212;some because of physical condition and some, I am sorry to say, out of little more than selfishness on the part of owners who have no intention of letting or selling them. By following the lead that has been taken in England and Wales, we could make those homes available for social rent, which would not only meet immediate need, but would bring resources back into use that would otherwise continue to rot over the coming years.<place-holder colnum=\"18407\"/></p><p>We all know of the serious problems that local authorities often have with planning issues when we seek to build new homes. We will bear those issues in mind later today when we hear the Executive's proposals on the planning system. Especially in urban areas such as Glasgow, where space is at a premium&#8212;particularly open space&#8212;we have difficulties in building homes because people feel that such building is an intrusion that results in their having no control over what happens in their communities.</p><p>In Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and elsewhere, as well as in some rural areas, the number of empty homes is almost as high as the number of people who are waiting for a place for social renting. A small proportion of those empty homes being brought back into use would help to meet need. A compulsory leasing order, as proposed by Shelter and which would be similar to the scheme that has been brought in south of the border, would enable local authorities to bring a home into use, to recoup renovation costs and management costs from rent, and to help to provide good quality, affordable, socially rented housing for all those who need it.</p><p>There are one or two other opportunities in the bill that we should not waste. The tenancy deposit scheme has been mentioned and the minister's words on that in committee and in the chamber are welcome. Citizens Advice Scotland estimates that somewhere between &#163;52 million and &#163;75 million is being held in Scotland as tenancy deposits. Let us not forget that that is tenants' money, not landlords' money. Not only should that large sum of money be held independently, with only reasonable deductions being taken off, but the interest from it should be put to use for the good of tenants, not landlords.</p><p>Beyond that, there is an opportunity to address wider management standards. The minister is right to speak of the balance between supporting the private rented sector and ensuring high standards. However, we should not imagine that high standards are a purely physical matter. Management standards also impact heavily on tenants' quality of life, so we should take the opportunity to address them. Members know that I supported Cathie Craigie's amendments to the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill on registration of private landlords&#8212;one of the few parts of that bill I really liked. We should take the opportunity that is presented by the bill to build on that system so that we can address issues such as rights of access and the rights and obligations of tenants as well as those of landlords. We must ensure that tenants and landlords have information about their rights and obligations and that we give them a clear and simple route for making complaints and seeking redress. The bill <place-holder colnum=\"18408\"/> presents an opportunity to drive up management standards.</p><p>Other members have mentioned disability. We heard compelling evidence from Ownership Options Scotland. I do not have time to address such matters, except to say that I share the concerns that were expressed. I welcome other provisions in the bill and will endorse its general principles. I thank my fellow committee members, colleagues on the clerking team and the researchers for making this a relatively pain-free process.

It is, however, just possible that the relationship between the level of interest in a debate and its importance is not always a direct one.</p><p>The minister began her speech by talking about the importance of legal aid reform. We should also recognise the importance of the Executive's general theme of access to justice, which covers attempts to address the physical barriers and barriers that stem from intimidation and emotional factors and the need to support people in a variety of ways to ensure that they have access to justice. However, the financial barriers to justice are also extremely high. Even if every other aspect of the Executive's work in this area was 100 per cent successful, the financial barriers alone would be enough to make us extremely worried.</p><p>In its letter&#8212;I assume that it was sent to all of us&#8212;the Scottish Legal Aid Board states:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Scotland has a well developed legal aid system which provides wider scope than in the vast majority of other jurisdictions\".</p><p>That may well be true, but the fact remains that access to justice is dependent upon being on one side of the ever-increasing wealth gap in our society. For people on one side, access can be found through legal aid if they are lucky. For people on the other side, the ability is there simply to buy access to law and justice. However, for most people in the middle the prospect of legal action can be financially terrifying. Even minor action can put a huge dent in the average bank account. If substantial, long-running or complex actions arise, the pressure to simply give up the search for justice can be huge. Phil Gallie was right to say that that applies not only to individuals, but to small businesses, charities, community groups and campaign groups.</p><p>My experience in that regard relates to two specific issues. One was the section 28 case, when affected organisations and charities had their funding frozen because of action that was taken not against them, but against the city council. To ensure that they had access to justice in the judicial review that took place, they had to ensure that they were represented. The only way in which they could do that was to find lawyers who were prepared to work essentially for nothing because of their sympathy with the case. The other case, with which there might be less sympathy on some benches, is the M74. Whatever people feel about whether the road should be built, the people concerned should have the right to challenge the minister's decision. They should not be barred simply by the threat of facing tens of thousands of pounds of expenses.</p><p>On the specific proposals, allowing legal aid to fund non-solicitor advice is welcome. I am sure <place-holder colnum=\"18344\"/> that we have all seen much in the Citizens Advice Scotland briefing about the great range of work that is already going on, and the thousands of cases in which citizens advice bureaux around the country are providing support.</p><p>We need to be careful of some of the consequences. As Jackie Baillie mentioned, one consequence of providing more alternatives when people cannot access solicitors through legal aid is that people might feel that they have no option but to use the alternatives as substitutes for professional legal advice, when professional legal advice is what is required. As Scottish Women's Aid has argued, in some circumstances not accessing professional legal advice could have devastating consequences for people's personal safety and that of their children. Some of the alternative services that we support, such as mediation and alternative dispute resolution, are not always appropriate in, for example, domestic abuse cases. However, we should remember the large number of cases for which those alternative services are appropriate.</p><p>I see that Christine Grahame is not here&#8212;everyone I have mentioned in this debate has left the room before I have got to them. She mentioned her experience of Baltimore. Many European countries are making much better use of mediation and alternative dispute resolution than we are. Those services can lead not only to satisfactory outcomes, but to a far greater sense of participation and ownership of the solution to a conflict or a problem. I welcome the Executive's proposals on that issue.</p><p>Although some proposals have been on the table for several years, progress on them has been slow and conservative so far. I hope that the questions that are raised through the consultation will help to move matters on. I have sympathy with Kenny MacAskill's comments. He argued strongly for much more fundamental and radical reform of the system. I wonder whether, constructive though the consultation is as part of the process, it will lead to fundamental reform. Therefore, I intend to support Kenny MacAskill's amendment.</p><p>In my final few moments, I will say something about the fundamental reasons why we need to consider access to justice carefully. We all, I hope, want to arrive at a situation in which everyone is equal under the law. We are not there yet, but we may get there eventually. However, even if we are equal under the law, if access to the law remains a commodity, inequality and injustice in the system will persist. People have a right to health care, which is why we have a national health service and why we do not charge people to see their doctor or to visit their relatives in hospital; instead, we pay for that collectively. People have a right to education, so we have created schools that do not <place-holder colnum=\"18345\"/> charge for lessons or exams; instead, we pay for them collectively. People have a right to speak to their elected representatives, so we do not charge them to come to surgeries, to vote or to put petitions before Parliament&#8212;we pay for that collectively. If access to justice, justice and equality under the law are rights, we should increasingly move towards paying collectively to ensure that people have no financial hurdles to get over to access their rights under the law.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-23", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13343492", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Legal Aid Reform"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, was disappointed to hear that the whips had been   scouring the corridors in an attempt to round up speakers for the debate.

Earlier, Bill Aitken talked about the five high-level objectives of the bill that are also intended to be the values of the licensing system. In welcoming those values, the only regret that I have is that alcohol is to be the only recreational drug to which we apply such a sensible approach. It would be beneficial if the same approach were taken to other recreational drugs that are currently illegal, many of which have higher social and health costs.</p><p>The bill's ideas about local forums are welcome. Not only do local people need a listening ear and the right to object, they also need a forum in which to participate. Perhaps, when he closes, the minister could tell us whether it is expected that those forums will meet in public. If they are in keeping with local authority committees, that would be expected. However, that is not made clear in the bill.</p><p>The right of local people to object is important and there is a clear parallel with the planning system, which we will debate at great length in the coming weeks and months. However, there is no point in empty consultation exercises that leave people feeling that their views and opinions have been ignored. There is no point in continually turning people off engaging with local authorities or the Executive on decisions that will impact on them. If people find that their views have fallen on deaf ears, they will be less likely to engage in the future. We need to have a listening ear, but we also need to give weight to communities' views and objections.</p><p>The simplification of licences is to be welcomed, as are the provisions on irresponsible drinks promotions and the Executive's confirmation that it will consider extending those measures to off-<place-holder colnum=\"18191\"/> sales in some way. However, we should ask whether the bill should also include provisions on the promotion of responsible drinking. Information about support services and problem drinking should be available at the point of sale, and I wonder whether that should be covered in the bill.</p><p>There are some reserved aspects&#8212;Brian Adam touched on them&#8212;including the wider use of the media and advertising to drive up consumption. The promotion of consumption by young people has changed slightly due to public pressure on the sale of alcopops and so on, but there are still many aspects of the way in which alcohol is promoted that we should address.</p><p>In the minister's policy document&#8212;and, I think, in his opening speech&#8212;he quite rightly dismissed the myth of 24-hour drinking. I have received e-mails and one or two letters from people who are concerned that there will be 24-hour drinking&#8212;that perception is still out there, and we need to challenge it. The presumption against 24-hour drinking is absolutely the right approach, but there is no reason why we should not welcome a premises-by-premises approach, with determination made locally.</p><p>The general approach on personal licences is welcome. Training will be a condition of personal licences but, having looked through the documentation, I am still unclear about what that training will cover. Will it simply be about the legal requirements of holding a licence or will it cover the more useful stuff, such as public health, conflict prevention and resolution and good practice?</p><p>I want to say something about access for under-18s. First, at the lower end of the age range, I completely endorse Paul Martin's insistence on proper baby changing facilities, although I am happy to admit that I do so from a far more selfish point of view. If people were expected to change their babies on tables in bars I would rapidly find myself uncomfortable drinking my pint there. It is clear that the provision on baby changing facilities is needed.</p><p>I am unclear about the rationale for the opt-in approach. It seems to me that, in the bill, we do not have something that is at one extreme or the other&#8212;purely opt-in or purely opt-out. There is some useful stuff about encouraging licensees carefully to consider the implications of allowing under-18s access to their premises, but I worry about the implicit acceptance in the committee's report of the idea that large numbers of establishments are simply inappropriate for under-18s. I wonder whether we should question that assumption rather than signalling approval of it.</p><p>Finally, I turn to some aspects that are not in the bill. There is a long-term trend away from locally <place-holder colnum=\"18192\"/> owned, independent establishments towards chain pubs and city centre megapubs. I walk home through Glasgow city centre quite late every Thursday night and I see the impact of city centre drinking. We should acknowledge that megapubs are a focus of social problems in some parts of the country. The way in which highly intensive, industrialised drinking establishments are run makes it more difficult for staff to get to grips with, for example, resolving conflict in a non-violent way and turning people away from the bar if they are already drunk.</p><p>Tavish Scott and Bruce Crawford mentioned the importance of culture change, which it is right to say will not result from legislation.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-22", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13343069", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Licensing (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Every other party has extended its welcome to Mr Brownlee and it would be rude if the Greens did not do the same.

The event gave me the opportunity to reminisce about my experience of working for the sexwise helpline, which provides sexual health information to young people between the ages of 12 and 18. I used to do two shifts a week; it was not the best job I have had in my life because pressure was high and it involved taking many phone calls and much abuse. People often wanted very simple information; for example, time after time, they wanted terms to be defined. By the time I left that job, I must have defined most sexual activities more times than I will ever participate in them&#8212;not a happy thought for a single 20-something.</p><p>That experience reinforced for me the huge number of myths that existed then. I came to that job thinking that many of those myths would have died off decades earlier, but they are still out there. We need to take serious action to tackle the great deal of ignorance and myth that continue to exist. Later in my career, I worked as a full-time youth worker, when it was again brought home to me that as far as people's sexual health needs and the issues that impact on their sexual health are concerned, individuals gain a wide range of experiences at school, at home and at work. We need to be aware of that wide range of experiences.</p><p>The Conservative party is right to tell us that parents have a responsibility for young people's sexual health and the Executive's strategy is right to say the same thing; we all acknowledge the importance of parents' role. However, we must also acknowledge that not all parents exercise that role and that the vast majority of those who do so support the provision of good quality sex education at school on top of&#8212;not as an alternative to&#8212;their own efforts. They also support young people's access to services and information. As Scott Barrie said, not all parents will be able or willing to provide the necessary information and support.</p><p>I condemn the idea of giving school boards and parents a veto over the use of specific materials. We all saw how ugly the section 28 debate got. You can bet your bottom dollar that, if that power were available, it would be exercised and abused by some of the most unpleasant elements in <place-holder colnum=\"17935\"/> society. If Nanette Milne believes what she says about wanting to support the LGBT community and its specific sexual health needs, I ask her to re-examine her policy on that right to veto.</p><p>I turn to the Scottish National Party amendment. One of the concerns in respect of sexual health as a whole has been about timescales for solid implementation plans. The Green party believes that it is worth supporting an amendment that calls for timescales to be published. Even if, at the end of the day, we expect the timescales to come from the advisory committee, we should say that we want them. We support the intention behind the SNP amendment, which asks for timescales.</p><p>The motion calls on Parliament to welcome the strategy. I welcome it, but it is most important that I do so because of the principles on which it is based. Sexual health is not just about an absence of disease; it is about a range of social and emotional&#8212;and political&#8212;factors that impact on people's sexual health and their ability and confidence to access services.</p><p>However, I have one or two caveats about the wording of the strategy document. It takes six areas as starting points, the second of which is that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"committed and stable relationships, characterised by these values, are the right setting for sexual relationships\".</p><p>My point may be about just a minor aspect of language, but it is wrong to suggest that people should not have sex and that we should disapprove of people who have sex outwith committed and stable relationships. Committed and stable relationships are fantastic and we should support them and encourage people to pursue them. However, equally we should not disapprove of people just because they have sex outwith such settings.</p><p>My amendment deals with the balance between clinical and prevention services. It is perhaps understandable that the minister's speech focused largely on the clinical side. There is a great deal that we need to get right in our clinical services and in the way in which people can access a range of services. I am thinking of local services and services that need to be accessible not only geographically and physically but because they meet specific needs.</p><p>We also have to get right prevention and education. If we want to create a culture of respect and responsibility, GUM clinics are not the place to do it; the whole of society is that place. There is little point in putting all our resources into clinical services. We need to improve health and not just to treat ill-health.</p><p>We need to put equality and diversity at the heart of our understanding of the issues. We have <place-holder colnum=\"17936\"/> to recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work and that we need to consider issues such as age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and language. Legal status is also important, for example in addressing the needs of asylum seekers and refugees who come from different countries and who have a different range of sexual health needs. They might have a different concept of what sexual health is and of their relationship to treatment and medical services, for example. Those matters are implicit in the strategy, but we need to ensure that they are explicit in everything that we do. I look forward to the committee coming up with the explicit aspects of the strategy.</p><p>My amendment mentions the Caledonia Youth project, whose Glasgow branch has been examining specifically the needs of excluded young people. That work has included young offenders at Her Majesty's young offenders institution Polmont and young people who are coming out of care&#8212;the sort of people who are excluded from a wide range of mainstream support services.</p><p>If we end up with the loss of existing services and if existing professionals move to other fields, lose their skills or even their motivation because of uncertainty about funding, we will go in the wrong direction. We should build services. Eventually, the new funding for the strategy will build on existing provision but, in the meantime, we absolutely must not lose our existing services.</p><p>Again, I welcome the strategy and the fact that a committee has been appointed to work on the subject. I encourage Andy Kerr in his visit to the Sandyford clinic to take the opportunity to meet the people at Caledonia Youth; that clinic is where they are based.</p><p>I want to underline that there will be a continued need for proper resourcing, and for good work with the voluntary sector as well as with the public sector, and that we will need political will. A minority of people&#8212;they present themselves as the moral majority&#8212;do not want there to be sex education or recognition of equality and diversity. It will take continued political will to ensure that that agenda does not hold sway, and that instead we end up improving the sexual health of Scotland's young and old people.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-2958.4, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"recognises that there is a need both for clinical services and for prevention work which enables individuals to take greater control of their own sexual health and that both elements must be delivered in ways which recognise the diversity of the population and respect their equal rights to information and services; is concerned, therefore, by the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow to cut the funding to Caledonia Youth's Glasgow branch, which will lead to the closure of a service with a record of working to address the sexual health needs of excluded young people, and calls <place-holder colnum=\"17937\"/> on the Executive to work with NHS boards to ensure that existing services are maintained and improved upon wherever possible.\"</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-15", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13342486", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sexual Health"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will try to follow that speech with a seriousness that it does not deserve.

Like the other amendments that I have lodged, my amendments in the group originate from the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, which is the representative body of the charitable and voluntary sector in Scotland. My amendments cover three broad issues. I expect some of them to be resisted as the arguments have been rehearsed previously, but I hope that some of them will elicit a little more sympathy.</p><p>Amendment 49 would change the charity test in one small way in that a body would fail the charity test if its income or property&#8212;rather than its property alone&#8212;were distributed, or if its constitution allowed for its income or property to be distributed. The amendment would provide an additional safeguard and I hope that it will be seen as a constructive addition to the bill.</p><p>Amendments 50 and 51 are about the principle of independence. It is important to note that in general the bill has managed to achieve a central place for the idea that charities are independent. The bill has managed to preserve that principle, but certain aspects of the provisions could be improved. Independence for charities should mean independence from government at all levels. Amendment 50 would add local authorities, so that if charities were under the direct control of local authorities, that situation would have to change. It seems no more reasonable that local authorities should control an organisation that has charitable status than that other levels of government should do so. It is important to note that the amendment would not change the power of ministers to exempt certain categories, so that where councils would be unable to continue to provide a certain level of services if charitable status were lost, the matter could be addressed through ministerial order.</p><p>Amendment 51 deals not with direct control but with the appointment of trustees. The argument will be familiar to those who have been involved in the consideration of the bill. The idea comes from <place-holder colnum=\"17843\"/> the original McFadden report recommendation that no more than a third of trustees should be appointed by public bodies. I do not expect any last-minute conversions on the issue, but I feel that the point of principle about public appointments undermining the independence of charities should be aired in our debate today. I look forward to hearing the minister's comments.</p><p>Finally, amendment 52 is about the disposal of property. The amendment reflects an important principle. It would ensure that property that may have been given to an organisation specifically because it had charitable status should not be distributed to non-charitable bodies. The SCVO has expressed serious concerns about the ministerial power on the issue and I am happy to give voice to those concerns in the chamber.</p><p>I move amendment 49.</p>", "hdate": "2005-06-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13342211", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill: Stage 3: Section 7 &#8212; The charity test"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will try to be quick.

That criticism has not been of the intention to tackle the serious offences that the minister described as despicable, which should be the target of the bill, but of the way in which the bill risks making offences of perfectly normal and innocent sexual activity and sexual exploration by young people, including people who are over the age of consent. If we want young people to learn to exercise that consent responsibly and to respect themselves and one another, we have to make it clear that we respect their ability to do so and their right to do so; 16 and 17-year-olds rarely go behind the bike sheds to discover their sexuality these days. Very often, they go online&#8212;to chat, to flirt, to get to know one another and to express their sexuality in a perfectly normal and non-abusive way.</p><p>Our duty to extend the protection of the law against abuse into that new domain in society should not result in interference in behaviour that is normal, non-abusive and entirely private.

There is also ambiguity around what is appropriate or inappropriate behaviour, and around what is appropriate or inappropriate material and information to give to young people.

We all agree on the value of those formal spaces, but informal areas&#8212;not just parks, but wild spaces&#8212;are important if we want to encourage children, and particularly young children, to get into the habit of active play, which can lead to a more active life and to better health later. Donald Gorrie and several other members mentioned that.</p><p>The loss of green spaces, open spaces and sporting facilities is one of the issues that has most frequently arrived on my desk in the two years since I joined the Parliament, and I am sure that every other member throughout Glasgow and well beyond would say the same. In north Glasgow, wild spaces have been threatened for luxury housing that is likely to cost about &#163;300,000 or &#163;400,000 a unit, which is not accessible to most people in the area. In Mike Watson's constituency, a small park that is known as the back park is under threat for housing. In one of the areas that are often dismissed as the leafy suburbs of the west end are the Dowanhill tennis courts, to which Pauline McNeill referred.</p><p>Members have also mentioned the North Ayrshire example, about which we were e-mailed today. What struck me from the communication about that situation was the perception that the <place-holder colnum=\"17459\"/> local council is determined to bulldoze public opinion. That is a major feature of the problems that we have with how the planning system works. Whatever we think of the rights or wrongs of one case, the perception is that people's interests in and beliefs about how their communities should be developed are not being taken on board.</p><p>We should also acknowledge, as shown by the \"Investigating environmental justice in Scotland\" report that the Scottish Executive commissioned and which was published just last week, that the trend towards the loss of such spaces is worse in the most deprived and disadvantaged areas of Scotland, including parts of Glasgow.</p><p>The planning system not only fails to provide a safeguard, but is a source of the problem. Pauline McNeill was right to say that comparing different green spaces is not enough, because some spaces are not accessible or appropriate. Not even close and accessible alternatives are enough. Young people and particularly children want to have a choice of places to go to. The undeveloped and wild spaces that are not formally laid-out parks may be just a resource that is waiting to be exploited to a developer, but to children they are places waiting to be explored. We need to protect such areas.</p><p>We know that many planning consents are being granted for fear of the developer's right to appeal. That unfair appeal stage is part of the problem. The lack of enforcement in planning is another problem, particularly when developers make reapplication after reapplication with minor tweaks to ensure that consent for a development is eventually granted.</p><p>I am sorry to say that some councils are complicit by ignoring some spaces and allowing them to be degraded so that the local community feels less attachment and values them less, which means that fewer people object when applications are made to develop such spaces. I echo the disappointment that has been expressed about the Executive's apparent intentions with respect to equality and sustainability in the planning system.</p><p>Generations of our forebears would be unimpressed if they saw what we are doing to the legacy that Dennis Canavan spoke about. They dedicated spaces to their communities without being interested in personal gain, but we are ploughing up those spaces not only for schools and affordable social housing, but for luxury housing, car parks and supermarkets.

The term, \"social economy\" is sometimes difficult to pin down. We use it to define much that lies between the purely public realm and the purely private realm in which the only objective is profit. However, \"social economy\" is not a synonym of \"voluntary sector\". That is reflected in the Executive motion. The social economy includes the formal voluntary sector and many charitable organisations, but it should also be understood to include the domestic economy and the social enterprise sector, on which the Green amendment focuses. That is not to undermine the significance of the traditional voluntary sector. I am a former employee of that sector and am delighted to endorse the warm words about its value to society that we heard from the minister and Linda Fabiani. However, the not-for-profit organisations with which we are all familiar, which are often grant funded and project oriented, are just part of the wider social economy, which also includes organisations that choose to be the more-than-profit organisations that are known as social enterprises.</p><p>Social enterprises trade in markets and make use of grants and subsidies in a way that is similar to the approach of commercial small and medium-sized enterprises. They make profit, but they do so <place-holder colnum=\"17084\"/> in order to ensure their long-term sustainability. They do not distribute profit to private shareholders or seek always to maximise profit, because their approach to markets is based on a social purpose or a public good. The in-built profit element enables organisations to grow and to make long-term plans. Voluntary organisations can become locked into dependence on grant funding, which gives them little incentive to innovate and become self-sustaining.</p><p>Part of the confusion surrounding the social economy is that, although traditional voluntary organisations and new social enterprises share certain values and organisational features, they do not always take the same approach to sustainability, to markets, to enterprise and to entrepreneurship. The best social enterprises combine the ethos of the voluntary sector with the entrepreneurship of the private sector.</p><p>Social enterprises take a wide variety of forms. They can be co-operatives, development trusts or companies limited by guarantee, and community interest companies will no doubt emerge, too. However, the legal status of an organisation should not be taken as being its defining feature. What unites all such enterprises is social purpose and a commitment to objectives that go beyond a return on capital.</p><p>A strategy for the social economy as a whole should not focus only on the needs of the traditional voluntary organisations or charities, or on any other single form of organisation. A successful strategy will be highly differentiated and will recognise the complexity of the social economy. No one assumes that the private sector requires a single policy&#8212;one instrument or one toolkit from the Executive's Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department. Large amounts of Government resources are directed at development agencies and at national, regional and local strategies. That reflects the complexity and the diverse needs of the private sector, but the social economy requires similar thinking and the deputy minister's words showed that the Executive understands that type of thinking. The recent announcement on the social investment Scotland futurebuilders plus fund showed that further steps were being taken in the right direction.</p><p>A cross-departmental approach to the social economy is required. The natural policy environment for not-for-profit organisations should remain with the Executive department responsible for communities, but it is clear that social enterprises need to have a strategic position within the department that is responsible for enterprise.</p><p>Some people compare the social economy to a family. Like family members, organisations in the social economy may look a bit like one another <place-holder colnum=\"17085\"/> and may share certain characteristics. However, they sometimes have very different personalities and, despite their similarities, there are differences. One difference is the extent to which they lean towards public sector or private sector methodologies and behaviours. Social enterprises tend to come from one side of the family, but so far, policy development in Scotland has revolved around the other side of the family. I hope that that will change and I think I am justified in expecting that it might.</p><p>I apologise because I am unable to remain for the whole debate.</p><p>I move amendment S2M-2825.2, to insert at end:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"recognises the breadth of the social economy in Scotland; further recognises the distinctive contribution that co-operatives and social enterprises make to the social economy; recommends the development of a differentiated strategy to meet the specific needs of the social enterprise sector of the social economy, and further recommends that such a strategy be developed in partnership with social enterprises and their networks beyond the voluntary sector, be aligned with the development of the Co-operative Development Agency and be aligned with the Department of Trade and Industry's strategy to support social enterprise across the rest of the United Kingdom.\"</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-19", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13340401", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Voluntary Sector and the Social Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "This is a welcome opportunity to discuss the social economy.

Finally, I happened to be in my office in Holyrood&#8212;by now I was an MSP&#8212;when a colleague told me that Nicol Stephen was standing in front of a camera, telling the BBC his decision. He did not tell me as a representative, as a witness to the inquiry or as an objector to the orders; he told the BBC first.</p><p>It is clear that people who engage with the planning system are not given the respect that they are due as active citizens. Reforms to the planning system have to rectify that&#8212;and I hope that the minister hears. Yes, we need the system to be effective, to be faster and to endorse and facilitate sustainable development, but it must also be fair. If it is going to involve people, they have to be trusted. That trust has been denied them in the past. In effect, they have repeatedly been told at the end of the day that they are not valid participants and that they cannot appeal against bad planning decisions, even though developers can. Unless people know that they can get involved on an equal footing, they will never engage and&#8212;even though we can talk about it all we want&#8212;consultation will not materialise.

Mary Scanlon mentioned the Housing (Scotland) Bill, with which the Communities Committee is dealing. I am sure that the minister has already been made aware of some of the discussions that took place at the committee's meeting this week. For example, Ownership Options in Scotland argued that the bill's proposals would</p><p class=\"indent\">\"diminish ... the financial support given to disabled people to adapt their homes\"</p><p>and that the Executive</p><p class=\"indent\">\"can afford to give Scottish disabled people the same right to grant as disabled people in the rest of the UK.\"</p><p>That is something that we need to take every bit as seriously as employment legislation, because the right to request that an employer make reasonable adaptations to the workplace is of little use if a person cannot get out of their house to go to work, or if the emotional barriers that are a consequence of a physical barrier in the home prevent them from job seeking and getting ready for work. I am sure that the minister is already considering those matters, and that we will have opportunities to discuss them.</p><p>The motion also mentions the need for a single equality bill. I very much support that and, if the Queen's speech includes a commitment to early introduction of such a bill, I will welcome that move. At some point, we will need to go further and not only amalgamate the Disability Rights Commission, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality, but raise the level of protection&#8212;including on provision of goods and services&#8212;in all strands of equalities, not just those that are currently covered by European directives. However, any progress in the right direction is to be welcomed.</p><p>I thank the few members who managed to come to the reception that Cathy Peattie and I hosted in Parliament a couple of weeks before the election. Perhaps one should not host receptions a couple of weeks before elections if one wants MSPs to turn up at them, but I am grateful to Malcolm Chisholm for speaking at it. We also heard from the Department of Trade and Industry and from Scottish equalities organisations.</p><p>I was particularly pleased to see the references to sexual health in the \"Manifesto for Inclusion\". I previously worked in a role supporting a group who experience society's assumptions about sexuality, sexual behaviour and sexual identity. Many people of various identities and walks of life have assumptions placed on them by society about their sexuality. Disabled people often have the assumption made about them that they have no sexuality, so I was pleased to see that the manifesto challenges that assumption and acknowledges that people should be treated <place-holder colnum=\"16900\"/> equally with respect to the delivery of information and services about sexual health matters.</p><p>The Executive's recently launched sexual health strategy was originally developed by a working group that included people who have from their professional lives significant expertise regarding disabled people and the issues that they face. Because of that, the original strategy was quite strong on issues of diversity. I have about seven pages in front of me that show the differences between the original strategy and the final strategy, which most people would acknowledge to be weaker on some issues.</p><p>It is important that the national advisory committee on sexual health, for which the Executive is currently recruiting, make a significant effort to bring back that level of expertise to ensure that the targets that are set, and on which the Executive will monitor progress on sexual health, include targets that challenge service delivery in terms of accessibility, outreach and providing information and education to different communities, including disabled people. I very much hope we will hear soon from the Minister for Parliamentary Business that we will have a debate on the sexual health strategy, so that the issues can be debated more widely and with a few more MSPs present.</p><p>I will share an observation that I have made, which arose from a meeting I attended at Glasgow City Council quite a number of years ago, before I was an MSP, when I was representing the city's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organisations. That meeting was a coming together of various different equality strands and organisations. I ended up having a bit of an argument about the social model of disability. The social model is very much part of the basis of the manifesto. It has great value and has helped to move the debate on and to increase understanding of how people are disabled not necessarily by their condition, but by the condition of society and the barriers that society places on them. There are difficulties applying that model to other equality organisations, however. A representative of a disabled people's organisation tried to argue that we should apply social models to racism, homophobia, sexism and so on, but there are limits to how that model can be applied. It is not so long ago that other minority groups in society were medically marginalised, as disabled people have been medically marginalised. Application of the social model carries the danger of going backwards for some groups who have already overcome that problem.</p><p>We need to support disabled people and their organisations and representatives in challenging the physical and social barriers that still apply to them.</p>", "hdate": "2005-05-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13339948", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Inclusion Scotland"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my congratulations to Sandra White on securing the debate and to Inclusion Scotland for the contents of its manifesto.

Far too many women are being sent to prison without good cause.

In Scotland, it puts us in mind of the massacre that took place in Dunblane. Time after time we express our grief and our shock after such incidents, yet guns remain on display and on sale across Scotland.</p><p>As the Executive has announced in respect of sporting knives, guns are not all used for legitimate purposes. Even those that are used for innocent target practice&#8212;as Jeremy Purvis told us&#8212;can end up falling into the wrong hands or their use can result in tragic accidents.</p><p>I share some of Cathy Jamieson's reaction to the SNP motion. It is sad that a clearer motion has not been lodged. The motion does not call for tighter regulation; it calls for devolved regulation. Members know very well that I support the bringing of those powers to Scotland, but I wish that we were debating a call for tighter regulation rather than one for devolved regulation.</p><p>I am also unclear about what the motion means when it refers to</p><p class=\"indent\">\"the distinct nature of the gun problem in Scotland\".</p><p>We should look at not only the types of weapons but the number of recorded offences. The proportion of incidents in which different types of weapons are used may vary between Scotland and England, but the number of recorded firearms offences in Scotland has been coming down, while in England and Wales the figure for many of those offences has been going up. Air weapons are not a new phenomenon and they are not distinctively Scottish. Figures from the Gun Control Network show that in the past four months alone, 47 incidents involving the use of air weapons have been recorded. Four of those were in Scotland; the rest were all in England or Wales.</p><p>There is a case for saying that the problem in Scotland is not distinct, but I would not move on from that to say that we should therefore leave the powers to deal with it at Westminster. I want those powers to be brought to Scotland, but I am not sure that the motion clearly states what we would do with them once we got them.</p><p>There is much to support in the Executive amendment, but I hope that what I perceive to be a contradiction at the end of the amendment can be explained. The amendment mentions the benefits of having tighter regulation than neighbouring countries have, but states that <place-holder colnum=\"15684\"/> shared arrangements between Scotland and the rest of the UK are an advantage. If loopholes can be exploited, why would differences in regulation between Scotland and England be more open to exploitation or abuse than differences in regulation between the UK and France or France and Germany? I say to the Executive that I am open to persuasion on its argument, which I will listen to in the minister's closing speech, but the issue should be addressed.</p><p>As for the Conservative amendment, I have to say that words fail me when I consider the behaviour of the Conservative party since the events at Craigend. There seems to have been a calculated insult from Michael Howard to the Morton family, to their community and to the people who were touched by the Dunblane massacre. To tell a grieving family that the problem is one of too much gun control beggars belief.</p><p>The Justice Department is not the only department that should do something about the matter. We need young people to grow up in a society that gives them hope and a sense of purpose and which fosters their ability to resolve conflicts without violence. It may be that the Education Department and the Development Department, which has responsibility for communities, have more to say on the subject that does the Justice Department alone.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-24", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336833", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Firearms Legislation"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I add my own words of condolence and concern for the family of the victim, Andrew Morton, in Craigend.

I am sure that none of us would disagree with that description.</p><p>I will raise two areas of concern that have been touched on by other members: the impact of the bill on sex education; and its potential impact on non-abusive consensual behaviour between people who are over the age of consent.</p><p>Sensitivities around sex education are such that a piece of legislation need not be used, or even be usable, against teachers to have an impact on the delivery of sex education. Section 28 showed us that clearly. It was never once used in court; according to senior legal figures, it never could have been successfully used in court. However, it was used in school boards, parent-teacher associations, the media and elsewhere as a weapon of fear by those whose agenda was one of bigotry and prejudice. Given the importance that the Executive has attached to the sexual health <place-holder colnum=\"15565\"/> strategy, it is essential that it takes seriously the possibility that risk of sexual harm orders could be used in the same way as section 28 by those who oppose meaningful and comprehensive sex education.</p><p>I emphasise that I am suggesting not that such orders will themselves be used against teachers, youth workers or others who provide education and advice, but that those who seek to undermine or detract from sex education or to cause fear among professionals could use the fear of such orders to deter professionals from continuing in their work or from volunteering for organisations and so on. I commend the written evidence from East Lothian Council, which suggested that the provision of education and advice, rather than categories of individuals such as teachers or youth workers, could be ruled out. That would send the right message about the importance of sex education while addressing the Executive's concern about the dangers of excluding categories of people from the offence in section 1.</p><p>The Executive has made clear its intention to lodge amendments at stage 2 to raise the age at which it becomes illegal to possess certain images from 16 to 18. That is highly problematic. It risks criminalising young people who are over the age of consent, their friends or their sexual partners for possessing images that have been created with consent for completely harmless purposes. The suggestion that the Justice 1 Committee heard that married couples and civil partners should be exempted reinforces the notion that all other sexual relationships are in some way inferior or are to be frowned on, and that the law should be less tolerant of people who have a sex life without a piece of paper from the state.</p><p>Similar concerns exist over the perfectly innocent use of chat rooms, websites, weblogs and online profiles by people who have no abusive intentions or history and who merely use such facilities either as part of their sex lives or to communicate with other consenting adults. I ask the minister whether it is possible to ensure that consent is referred to in the Executive's forthcoming amendments to ensure that young people who are over the age of consent are able fully to exercise their right to consent.</p><p>The protection of children from abuse is a serious matter&#8212;it can be a deadly serious matter&#8212;but if the Executive wants to ensure that its measures to address the need for protection are effective and gain the credibility that they need, it must take care to ensure that the provisions in the bill are relevant to real people's lives in the modern age, are not open to misuse or misunderstanding and focus on the real problem. I would not be able to support the bill if it was presented in this form at stage 3.

Members seemed dismissive of Mr Gorrie's attempt to raise the matter, but it is worth discussing. As more and more of us live alone, our energy consumption increases dramatically, as does the pressure on housing supply. If the Executive is serious about putting sustainable development at the heart of all decision making, it should attempt in its housing policies to address the trend towards single occupancy.</p><p>The other issue that I will address is the right to buy. The Deputy Minister for Communities said in her speech that she regrets that the right to buy is a focus of amendments to the motion, but I agree with the members who lodged the amendments that the issue deserves attention. Many housing organisations have argued that the current level of commitment to affordable rented housing is inadequate, with long waiting lists in many areas and thousands of homes being lost every year through the right to buy. The usual response to that is that those homes are not lost. Of course, physically they remain part of the housing stock, but the fact that they are lost to the social rented sector is significant. The thousands of additional affordable homes that the Executive has announced could be sold under the right to buy before we even know it and the Executive could find itself in danger of failing to meet the target to give everyone the right to a home by 2012.</p><p>Part of the solution must come from our attitudes to housing and the values on which our society is based. There is a widespread assumption that home ownership is the best option&#8212;a superior option&#8212;for everyone. That assumption relates partly to the type of housing that is available for social rent, but partly to our wider attitudes to acquisition and wealth. The Deputy Minister for Communities says that we should respond to aspirations for home ownership, but we should not respond in a way that fails to identify the difference between housing need and tenure preference. In short, we can respond to aspirations without feeding the notion that ownership is everything.</p><p>If the Executive is to address the issue of affordable rented housing and not just home ownership&#8212;I believe that it wants and intends to do that&#8212;there should be a determined effort to sell the idea of social housing rather than simply an effort to sell off the houses. Also, more could be done to encourage small-scale housing co-operatives and a range of other options that are more common in other European countries.</p><p>The private, public and community sectors all have a role to play in meeting housing need. Low-cost home ownership schemes are one part of the jigsaw but social rented housing is in greater need of attention because it has far greater potential to <place-holder colnum=\"15384\"/> meet Scotland's housing needs than is currently recognised.</p><p>As members have said, the Executive will report next year on the operation and effect of the right to buy. The Executive must be ambitious and not shrink from the task of challenging that policy. A report alone will not be enough. A review must consider the benefit to society that could arise from restricting or even abolishing the right to buy, at least for new lettings.</p><p>I look forward to working with my fellow members of the Communities Committee as we consider the Housing (Scotland) Bill and I hope that we can all look forward to more radical measures in the coming years.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13336005", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Off the top of my head, I say that I will be happy to discuss that with my colleagues.

People in the voluntary sector have been waiting for it for many years and it is good to see that it has arrived. We all regret the scandals that have taken place in the voluntary sector, which have undermined and shaken people's faith in the concept of charity, despite the fact that only a very small number of organisations were involved and that they do not reflect the field as a whole. Nevertheless, people's perceptions were shaken and voluntary sector organisations were left feeling undermined. That is despite the fact that charitable giving is still very much part of our culture, as witnessed in the response to the impact of last year's tsunami.</p><p>In the light of those scandals, a large part of the bill's purpose has been to build the charity brand, as people describe it. That is perhaps slightly uncomfortable marketingspeak, but the bill aims to build trust in and awareness of charities and to strengthen their identities. That is important not only with respect to donations and charitable giving, but for encouraging people to volunteer and to access services that are delivered by the voluntary sector.</p><p>The bill seeks to define what we mean by a charity, through listing the possible purposes. That is a significant improvement on what has gone before. I will mention a few details, as did Donald <place-holder colnum=\"15125\"/> Gorrie. There is an argument for including play and recreation, as well as sport, as charitable purposes. During committee consideration of the bill, I had occasion to draw members' attention to the difference between the charitable purpose of amateur sport in the United Kingdom Charities Bill and that in the Scottish bill. In England and Wales, amateur sport will have to involve \"skill and exertion\"; in Scotland, it will not. I wonder whether the minister and deputy minister would like to speak with their colleagues in the Health Department about that, to find out whether the definition is entirely appropriate.</p><p>On the charitable purpose given in section 7(2)(c), I was pleased that the committee agreed that \"the advancement of religion\" should be broadened slightly to include philosophical positions that do not have a supernatural basis and that are therefore not to be described as \"religion\". Donald Gorrie mentioned the need to ensure that forms of support other than care, such as advocacy, are included. I wonder whether the \"relief of poverty\" covers destitution, a phenomenon that is very much the consequence of UK immigration policy.</p><p>The charitable purposes, alongside the public benefit test, have been intended to build the identity, confidence and brand of charity. I have got a lot out of the Communities Committee's scrutiny of the bill, for which I thank my fellow committee members, but I have been aware of a steadily growing list of proposed exceptions. First, there are the national collections. We would all want a solution that does not harm the national collections.</p><p>However, when a conflict between public benefit and independence arises, we should surely address the question of independence. Surely we could argue that the organisations concerned should benefit from a limit to the extent of state control, as the McFadden commission suggested. I am not sure whether the Scottish ministers have responsibility for the McFadden commission, but I will mention that the commission's website has disappeared and has been replaced by an advertisement offering to arrange dates with Christian singles. I wonder who needs to address that.</p><p>Other organisations could be affected, including FE colleges, as Cathie Craigie mentioned. Again, there is a conflict between public benefit&#8212;which none of us would question&#8212;and independence. I still feel that the question to be addressed is the one that involves independence.</p><p>The exception to the charity brand that I have raised in committee on several occasions relates to designated religious charities. In his speech, the minister said that the purpose of exempting designated religious charities from large parts of <place-holder colnum=\"15126\"/> the regulatory regime was in recognition of their internal mechanisms and processes. The Deputy Minister for Communities told the committee that the exemption reflects the status of religion in society. I am not sure whether there are clear reasons for that; I found it difficult to understand the purpose of the exemption. The Scottish Churches Committee told the Communities Committee that it feared that the civil authority&#8212;meaning this Parliament&#8212;was overstepping the line in the relationship between the church and the state. However, in a democracy, it is for the civil authority to draw that line. The Parliament should be convinced that there is a just reason for exempting religious charities from regulation before it does so.</p><p>I slightly regret that the status of independent schools has been seen as such a contentious issue. The voluntary sector is much broader than that and many people in it welcome the bill. I agree with much of what Tommy Sheridan said, although I disagree with some of it. I would rather that we addressed the wider aspects of the voluntary sector in welcoming the bill, which the Greens will support this evening.</p>", "hdate": "2005-03-09", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13335321", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill: Stage 1"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I draw members' attention to the declaration in my register of interests that I am a director of GALA Scotland, a charity that organises an arts festival in Glasgow.

Even if we accept that figure&#8212;which I question&#8212;it pales into insignificance in comparison with the level of unclaimed benefit, which was, according to the Department for Work and Pensions, at least &#163;3 billion in the financial year starting in 2000.

Given that the students involved had the wisdom to admit that they were wrong and change their decision, I think that we should acknowledge our support for their making that reversal and cancelling the invitation.</p><p>Elaine Smith was right to dismiss the free speech argument. It is important to acknowledge that Nick Griffin's free speech has not been impaired or restricted in any way because we say that we will not speak with him. It would be wrong for any of us, in a misguided attempt to debate with fascist or racist parties, to give them the respectable platforms that democrats are entitled to occupy.</p><p>I will address the points that members have made regretting that the amendments mean that we will not unite behind a single motion. When events beyond the Parliament's remit impact on our work&#8212;including that of the Executive on anti-racism, which we all support&#8212;it is important that we acknowledge and debate the problems. If we disagree about something, we should have nothing to hide and we should disagree openly. If we agree about something, we should do that openly, too. I assume that the arithmetic of the chamber has not changed since yesterday's decision time, so the amendments are unlikely to be agreed to and members will unite behind the Executive motion.</p><p>The conflict between United Kingdom and Scottish policy and practice has an impact on work in Scotland. Information campaigns are all very well and have an important part to play, but when politicians court tabloid headlines that give the opposite message, they give legitimacy to the racist motives of the extreme right, as members argued. Both major parties at Westminster court tabloid headlines about who we want to keep out of the country, rather than about who we want to welcome and how we should support such people. That impacts on our ability to work for a racism-free Scotland.</p><p>We should acknowledge other events at Westminster, one of which was mentioned at question time by Cathy Peattie. She asked about work on the proposal to set up a single equality body&#8212;the proposed commission for equality and human rights&#8212;which is likely to be established by <place-holder colnum=\"14556\"/> a UK equality bill. The Commission for Racial Equality expressed severe concerns about the proposal. I do not share all those concerns, but they should be heard. The CRE said:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Though we are open to discussion of the best way to achieve ... progress, we unequivocally reject the proposals\".</p><p>It went on to say that the proposals</p><p class=\"indent\">\"would weaken the cause of equality overall, and racial equality specifically, and offer so little to the so-called 'new strands' that the relevant groups would receive second-class protection.\"</p><p>I do not support everything that the CRE says about the proposals, but it is important that we consider the CRE's position.</p><p>Many members welcomed the poster and media information campaigns, which have an important role. However, as the minister acknowledged, such campaigns represent only one piece in the puzzle. It is important to remember that equality is not soap powder or car insurance. Although we can use some of the tools that sell such products, that approach on its own is not enough. Campaigns can vary in their impact and effectiveness. I regretfully cite the limitations of the recent campaign by Glasgow City Council. Many people felt that the campaign used images that represented racial stereotypes and stereotypes to do with sexuality and sexual identity. That was regrettable, because people's concerns had been discussed with the council in advance of the campaign. Campaigns play an important but limited role; they are just one part of the picture.</p><p>Education from the earliest age is the most important thing to get right. There are sometimes conflicts between a young person's right to education and a parent's right to have their child educated in a manner that is consistent with the parent's beliefs. I am glad&#8212;and I think that all members will be proud to say&#8212;that we live in a society that places the emphasis on the former right, for the most part. None of us would find it acceptable for children to be taught in schools, for example, that mixed-race relationships are wrong, or that a minority ethnic group is morally inferior. I hope that we can all work towards the day on which we can make a similar statement in relation not just to racial equality, but to all strands of equality.</p><p>I welcome the minister's comments.

Before my election to the Scottish <place-holder colnum=\"14182\"/> Parliament, I gave evidence to the Equal Opportunities Committee, of which she was a member at the time. It was during that unpleasant period that I remember as the war of the clause. Just after it finished&#8212;and we had claimed victory&#8212;the youth group that I was working for had a competition to design their tee-shirts for the next Pride Scotland event. I am sorry to say that I cannot remember the design that was eventually chosen, but I kept with me my favourite&#8212;which never made it near the shortlist&#8212;because, although it was not colourful or visual, I loved the sarcasm of the tone. In simple text, it says:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Brian Souter and the Daily Record made it hard for me to come out, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!\"</p><p>I will clip it to my lectern as my mascot for this evening.</p><p>As a youth worker, for about eight or nine months during that unpleasant period, I went to bed every night thinking, \"What kind of a news day was that for us?\" That was not what I was supposed to be doing. I was supposed to be considering and working on some of the issues that Susan Deacon mentioned in her opening speech. An important one of those issues is the four-year delay that she talked about and the feelings and experiences that people have when they know who they are and that they want to come out but fear doing so, even though they know that it should not even be an issue. Those concerns were why I was giving evidence to the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8212;instead of a member of the youth group who had decided, on the morning that we were coming through, that he did not feel able to appear in such a high profile and high pressure situation, which many young people should be able to cope with. I am delighted that there are many people in LGBT Youth Scotland who, with that organisation's support, are able to speak about their experiences with the passion and articulacy that, unfortunately, eluded that member of my youth group.</p><p>A colleague of mine from down south, a black youth worker who had worked with black young men and gay young men, once described to me what he saw as the main difference between those two groups.

I would appreciate it if the Deputy Minister for Communities could say something about how those two targets fit together in her closing speech. Should they be understood to mean the same thing? Does eradicating child poverty within a generation mean the same as eradicating it by 2020? If so, is that target still achievable and are we still on track?

I endorse his comments about the health impacts and the self-esteem and emotional benefits of work. However, that is an ideal towards which we must strive; it is not a given. Some jobs actively undermine health, dignity and independence. Other forms of work, such as the unpaid work that takes place in the home, are not fully recognised and valued. The Green approach <place-holder colnum=\"13619\"/> both to recognising the value of all forms of work and to the redistribution of wealth would not result in the phenomenon of in-work poverty&#8212;a phenomenon that the Executive also recognises. The Green approach would also take us away from some of the poverty-trap issues that other members have mentioned.</p><p>The Labour Government at UK level has taken some steps in the direction of a citizen's income scheme, but without being explicit about it. A full citizen's income scheme would ensure that all people have the financial means to secure a decent standard of living and the incentive to be socially and economically active.</p><p>I also want to mention the Executive's financial inclusion work. Not only Christine Grahame, but many members across the chamber recognise that the devolution settlement is an issue in this respect.

Having a negative experience&#8212;whether because <place-holder colnum=\"13546\"/> of the outcome of a court case or because of a court's physical ability to support people in a way that is relevant to them&#8212;can lead to outright hostility rather than merely to simple distrust. Crimes going unreported because people have those feelings and are not willing to report crimes or are not able to give evidence when they get to court means that no Government policy of any kind, no policing policy, and not even having as many police on the streets as any Conservative could dream of, will be able to deliver justice.</p><p>Therefore, I was pleased, as other members were, to support the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004. During the passage of the bill, we supported calls from Justice for Children for the use of intermediaries and the right to therapy in court. Since then, we have pursued the question of intermediaries through parliamentary questions, in the hope of drawing attention to the work that is taking place in countries such as South Africa rather than merely the work that is being done in England and Wales. The Executive has responded by promising a detailed assessment of the pilots in England and Wales and a comparison with the work in other countries. In the minister's closing statement, it would be good to hear something about how quickly the issue can be addressed and what the timescale might be for having that assessment carried out. I also welcome the commitment to careful monitoring of implementation of the 2004 act, and I add our weight to calls for regular reports on its implementation.</p><p>It is important to recognise that the need for a positive and supportive experience applies in exactly the same way to victims as it does to witnesses. They need trust and confidence if they are to be willing to report future crimes. Most important of all is the role of Victim Support Scotland, which I am glad that Hugh Henry and other members mentioned. It is not only the criminal justice system and the courts that can ensure that victims have a positive experience; Victim Support Scotland can also ensure that that happens and that victims feel that they are recognised and taken seriously.</p><p>However, that in itself is not enough. Many victims also want to see meaningful consequences for offenders&#8212;not just prison sentences or fines, but consequences that have meaning and that are relevant to the offence. Many want to see offenders taking responsibility for their offences, but all too often that is turned into a suggestion that offenders can be made to take responsibility. \"Making offenders take responsibility\" is either an example of rhetoric or it shows a misunderstanding of the issue. After all, people cannot be made to take responsibility any more than an anti-racism campaign can make people not be racist or a health promotion campaign can <place-holder colnum=\"13547\"/> make people live a more healthy life. Taking responsibility is a voluntary act; the offender must buy into it. Achieving that will require us to work with offenders on their own terms. As a result, I agree strongly with Marlyn Glen that our treatment of offenders, including prisoners, is an important aspect of the debate on victims and witnesses. They are not separate groups in society; they live in the same society and do not experience separate criminal justice systems.</p><p>That brings me back to some of Hugh Henry's comments about restorative justice. Although I welcome many of the Executive's measures in that respect, the approach is still in its infancy. Indeed, some people dismiss it as a fashionable idea that has no substantial value while others regard it as peripheral. The position and perception of restorative justice have not been helped by the rhetoric about being tough on crime. For example, the Executive still promotes retribution as a purpose of the criminal justice system. Restorative justice should be seen not as a bolt-on to a punitive or retributive system of justice but as a rejection of such purposes. Improving offenders' lives is part of the same equation as improving victims' lives. That does not mean that we should give offenders an easy ride; instead, we should make them less likely to be offenders and make victims less likely to be victims in future.</p><p>I say to Hugh Henry that, although the jury is still out on restorative justice for adults, it has come in on retribution, prison and brutalising prisoners. Such approaches do not work and, until we end them, we will make no progress towards achieving the reduction in reoffending that we all want.</p>", "hdate": "2005-01-13", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13331299", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Victims and Witnesses"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "All members recognise the vital importance of ensuring that witnesses in the criminal justice system have a positive experience that leads to feelings of safety, confidence and trust, as that will impact on their willingness to report crime in the future and on their ability to give evidence in court.

I have expressed those concerns in the past. However, whatever the meaning of this Sewel motion, it is not for this Parliament to remain silent on any issue or development that affects Scotland, whether it originates in London, Brussels, New York, Washington or wherever.</p><p>The bill is deeply contradictory. It sets out to facilitate a significant expansion of the gambling industry&#8212;there would be no prospect of the gambling industry making the investment in new regional casinos if it did not expect a significant increase in the uptake of gambling&#8212;yet the rest of the bill sets about addressing the need for protection from the very effects of expansion that the first part of the bill would allow as well as some of the social responsibility issues that Tavish Scott mentioned.</p><p>The bill should be seen as a pay-off to the gambling industry for the introduction of better regulation. If the Government wants to regulate an industry, it should simply do so. We do not seek the tobacco industry's permission to regulate smoking or the sale of tobacco, or that of polluters to regulate environmental matters. Therefore, we <place-holder colnum=\"13410\"/> should not seek the gambling industry's permission to regulate it. One of the purposes of government is to restrain activity that causes social harm.</p><p>I want to consider the expansion that will result. There will be not only supercasinos, but the potential for 24-hour opening, unlimited jackpots and betting on Christmas day&#8212;I wonder how that squares with the support on the Labour back benches for the proposal to restrict the opening of retail stores on Christmas day. There will be an increase in the ability of casinos to advertise. How can such things do anything but lead to an increase in the take-up of gambling and in the incidence of problem gambling? Even in their scaled-back form, the proposals that are going through Westminster will lead to both consequences. No one could think that the gambling industry could undergo such expansion without an increase in problems being caused.</p><p>I am not at all convinced by the regeneration argument that has been made. Supercasinos might well create some employment, but so would other forms of recreational and entertainment facility. Many such facilities might possibly create better and more rewarding jobs. The Greens' take on many economic matters is that we must focus not simply on the amount of economic activity that can be generated, but on its effect&#8212;its impact. Creating some jobs might be a good thing, but if the operation is about taking money away from hard-pressed communities, including from victims of gambling addiction, and sending it straight into the hands of large corporate players, the long-term impact on communities in which such casinos operate will fly in the face of social justice.</p><p>We have been told that the UK limit will be set at eight regional casinos and that, even if one is proposed for Scotland, Scottish ministers will have at least a consultative role and potentially even a veto. However, both assurances&#8212;on the limit on numbers and on the role of Scottish ministers&#8212;are short term. They do not give any permanent protection, place permanent limits on the number of supercasinos or their location or give an assurance about the long-term intentions of Scottish ministers.

It contributed only 15 per cent of the reduction in price that has been achieved so far. Although that is not a figure to ignore, neither is it an overwhelming one.</p><p>I endorse the call from Friends of the Earth&#8212;a member organisation of the fuel poverty forum&#8212;for a greater push on the development of small-scale domestic renewable schemes that not only generate energy where it is needed for the people who need it, but which return the excess to the national grid, which can reduce people's fuel bills and even bring a repayment from time to time.</p><p>However, because of the longer-term picture and the ecological constraints that will force us to consume far less energy as a society, we have to think not only about domestic energy efficiency, but about our societal approach to how we produce, consume and charge for energy. Taxes on consumption of fuel and other resources&#8212;or eco-taxes&#8212;have a role to play because they can be levied in a socially just manner, with those who consume more than their share of resources paying disproportionately so that basic needs such as home heating remain affordable for all. That would also enable Government to make generous additional provision, such as for additional winter heating costs.</p><p>Shifting the burden of taxation from income alone to resources could help and would also have a knock-on effect on income. Income is less easily influenced by the Scottish Executive, but we should not ignore the possible exception of the council tax. Fairer local government finance is important and I am glad that a land-value tax will be one of the considerations of the current review.</p><p>Another Green proposal relates to Donald Gorrie's and Alex Neil's words about the citizens pension. I urge them both to look harder at our proposals for a citizens income for all. We all receive income from the state, whether through <place-holder colnum=\"12879\"/> tax thresholds, tax credits or benefit payments. The simplest way to ensure a basic quality of life for all people would be to give a basic income to all as a right of citizenship and to tax all other income progressively.</p><p>Fuel poverty and winter deaths are taken seriously by all members.

It is a credit to any politician when they say sorry, whether personally or on behalf of a Government and a society. However, the petition makes it clear that it is not enough to say sorry.

How can we give a sense that justice has been done to people who have experienced such injustice?<place-holder colnum=\"12413\"/></p><p>The petition makes it clear what we are being asked to do. In responding to it, the Minister for Education and Young People mentioned the huge amount of work that is being done to make records available. We should acknowledge the scale of that task and congratulate the Executive on its willingness to undertake it. However, I would be grateful for a comment from the Executive on what will be done about other organisations' files and records. Further dialogue with those organisations is one thing, but it must lead to the same transparency that the minister acknowledged is needed in the public sector.</p><p>I also welcome the minister's commitment to fund support services. As I have a background in one-to-one support and counselling work, I know how important it is that such services are available and established on the right footing. I am sure that all members will accept that that job will take some time. A further comment from the Executive on how much time will be required before that can be put in place would be very welcome.</p><p>That leaves us with what is perhaps the most troubling and difficult question: why? Why was abuse allowed to take place? Why was so much of it left hidden for so long? Why, when it was known about, was that often not enough to bring it to an end? As many members have said, the petition calls for a public inquiry. I admit to having some concerns about that. Public inquiries generally seem to promise the undeliverable and I am concerned that a public inquiry would create false hope. I am also concerned about whether public evidence sessions would be the best way of ensuring that all potential witnesses would be willing to give evidence. Such an inquiry would undoubtedly generate a high level of media attention and I worry that that would be a threat to its effectiveness. However, the call is an urgent one and it has been waiting too long to be heard. We should also not forget the importance of the point that Fiona Hyslop made, which was that anything less than a full public inquiry might be less able to result in legal action, where appropriate. If the concerns that I have expressed can be met and, perhaps more important, if the survivors of historical abuse do not share those concerns, I will add my voice to the call for a full public inquiry without further hesitation.</p><p>As a society, we have come a long way in the recognition and protection of the rights of children and young people. Just a few generations ago, children would have been seen as property, without the right to respect as human beings. We have come a long way since behaviour that we now regard as utterly unacceptable was perceived as normal, or at least went without challenge. We have come a long way, but we should judge our society's attitude to children and young people not only by our highest principles or our highest <place-holder colnum=\"12414\"/> aspirations but by the very worst experiences that children and young people undergo. If we are honest, we will all acknowledge that, for many young people in care and leaving care today, we still have a long way to go.</p><p>Finally, we should also judge our society on how willing we are to hear the voices of, and confront the challenges brought by, the victims of abuse that took place in the past, in a less safe time. I am glad that the Parliament has been open to the challenge presented by the petition, but I am sure that none of us would for a moment think that the process ends with this debate.

On being asked whether the party wanted to nationalise Tesco, Tommy Sheridan answered with a wry smile, and perhaps a joke, \"Not yet.\" We do not want to nationalise or abolish; we want to reduce the power and the dominance of the supermarkets. We want to put supermarkets back to where people wanted them in the first place&#8212;as part of a healthy and diverse mix of retail.</p><p>Food poverty is not just about the price of a loaf of bread or tin of beans. It is obvious to anyone that supermarkets can offer incredibly cheap deals on a few product lines if and when they choose to. However, their immense marketing muscle is always geared towards pushing highly processed products which, as well as being dubious on health grounds, makes it difficult to judge value for money. The reality is that most of those products are wildly more expensive than the cost of their ingredients.</p><p>There is also the cost of getting to the supermarket in the first place. When people have lost the option of buying locally, they travel hundreds of miles every year to do their shopping. That brings additional costs to those on low incomes who are unable to shop locally.<place-holder colnum=\"12248\"/></p><p>As Mark Ballard articulated earlier&#8212;only to be ignored by Mr Finnie&#8212;communities that oppose the growth of supermarkets, even communities that are oversupplied by supermarkets, cannot do so easily. The minister, in the finest tradition of the Scottish Executive silo mentality, dismissed that point as a planning matter. The role of the planning system is a central part of the story of the development&#8212;or, rather, overdevelopment&#8212;of supermarkets and until we redress the balance in the planning system in favour of communities, that will continue to be a problem.</p><p>Supermarkets can increase in size, can build more parking spaces and open new stores and they can do so with ease. Small shops cannot. Indeed, when small shops try to develop, they are hit with rates increases and when they try to attract shoppers, they know that those shoppers are comparing free parking at the supermarket with charged parking on the high street. The Executive's reform of the planning system must ensure that the wishes of communities are represented in the system that currently ignores them.</p><p>It is sad that many members who have spoken in today's debate are under the impression that buying three quarters of our groceries from four companies is the only way we can live. They argue that only big global supermarkets can offer the range of foods that people want to buy these days. That is nonsense&#8212;only supermarkets have the buying power that allows them to dominate markets. If that power were distributed more fairly and exercised more locally, demand for those products would still exist, there would still be those who wanted to meet that demand, exotic foods would not go out of fashion and it is likely that they would be traded more fairly. It is also likely that the products that we produce here would be sold here rather than our simultaneously importing and exporting vast quantities of the same stuff.</p><p>Only supermarkets&#8212;so the argument goes&#8212;can offer all the extra services that are developed alongside them. That is nonsense, too. Only supermarkets are being given the opportunity to develop in those ways. If someone runs one of the last handful of independent shops in their local high street, developing new services is not easily done because they are concerned with immediate survival. Every time a neighbour shuts up shop, the range of goods and services that draws people to the high street is diminished. If the butcher goes, the baker suffers. If the bank branch closes, the dry cleaner has to worry. However, a thriving locally owned retail cluster can develop co-operatively, even to the point of offering online ordering, combined home delivery schemes, child care while people shop and all the other attractive extras.<place-holder colnum=\"12249\"/></p><p>Some people would argue that to return to local food systems would be a backward step and that we cannot go backwards. I say that if we have made the wrong turn, if we have come the wrong way and if we look up and realise that we are heading in the wrong direction, we should turn back. I do not suggest that we turn back the clock, but we want recognition that the course of our food culture is heading in the wrong direction and we must turn it back. If we look down south, we see that the trend is several years more advanced than it is up here. It is years again more advanced in the United States. Do we want to head in that direction? If we want to end food poverty, to have a healthy diet for all and to have a healthy local economy for every town and city, it is time to turn back.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-25", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13327891", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Food (Supermarkets)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I take the point and refer the member to a comment that one of our Scottish Socialist Party colleagues made in the most recent election.

Children and young people are naturally curious about the world around them, and we must harness that curiosity. However, we should not forget the need to increase wider scientific understanding throughout society and the media. Almost every week I read a story one day in <em>New Scientist</em> , hear it slightly distorted on the radio the next day, and see another version later on television; by the time that the story reaches the printed press, it seems that almost no fact is reported accurately.</p><p>I acknowledge&#8212;as does the motion&#8212;the hard work that is done by Scotland's 40,000 scientists. There is a common perception of the Greens as anti-science, but that perception annoys me because we always endeavour to be informed by scientific evidence. Our position on climate change, for example, has developed alongside the work of the scientific community, right back to John Tyndall in the 1860s. We are opposed to genetically modified organisms because we believe that scientific and economic dangers <place-holder colnum=\"11737\"/> outweigh the known advantages. If the balance swings back the other way, we will revisit our position. When the facts change, we change our view.</p><p>Whatever the state of scientific understanding on those questions, we must always view them in the light of social, moral, ethical and legal considerations. Unfortunately, many scientists feel unable to focus on those issues, particularly these days, when much of their work is corporately funded. To reply to Elaine Murray's comment in her opening remarks, no one would imply that scientists act without reference to moral values but, after a debate on smoking, we must recognise that large corporations often appear to, and that they can distort or conceal the science to suit themselves.</p><p>When we take those considerations seriously, we have to draw a distinction between what those 40,000 scientists are doing for the economy and what they are doing for the common good&#8212;for society and for the environment that we depend upon. Are the geophysicists who sniff out oil deposits really helping the environment in the long run? Are the biotechnologists whose work may result&#8212;whatever their own hopes and motives&#8212;in greater corporate control of our food chain benefiting society?</p><p>As politicians faced with challenging technical issues and complex scientific theories, it is often tempting for us to defer to scientific experts and save ourselves a bit of homework but, as Einstein pointed out more than half a century ago,</p><p class=\"indent\">\"we should be on our guard not to overestimate science and scientific methods when it is a question of human problems ... we should not assume that experts are the only ones who have a right to express themselves\".</p><p>I think he meant that scientists should advise and inform our debate, but not dictate the direction in which that debate leads.</p><p>It is understandable that scientists are often too focused on the objective facts as they see them to recognise that there are legitimate subjective judgments to be made. The clearest example of that for me was the BSE debate. On television interview after television interview, a politician would say, \"Beef is safe to eat.\" Another politician would say, \"Beef isn't safe to eat\". An interviewer would turn to a scientist at some point in the programme and say, \"Well, is it? Is beef safe to eat?\" as though that was an objective fact. The reality, as the responsible scientist would always say, is that determining what is safe enough is a subjective judgment for us all to make.</p><p>Ultimately, what might be called scientific fundamentalism is as unattractive as any other kind of fundamentalism. We have to recognise that there are other factors&#8212;philosophical, cultural, <place-holder colnum=\"11738\"/> ethical, economic and political&#8212;to consider.

That is why Shiona Baird's amendment acknowledges at length the work that the Executive is undertaking.</p><p>It is a sign of the level of agreement on the importance of this issue that the debate has been relatively non-confrontational. If we are honest, we can say that there is much in every amendment as well as in the motion that we can all support.</p><p>I welcome Sandra White's support for Shiona Baird's amendment. Her call for long-term funding, which Shiona Baird echoed, was an important contribution. Addressing that need would be an important contribution to improving domestic abuse services. Margaret Mitchell gave me the novel and interesting opportunity to welcome the words of Iain Duncan Smith.</p><p>Among the issues that Shiona Baird raised was the need to meet the needs of older women. Although services for them might be available, many of them are reluctant to access them or are hesitant about doing so. The literature review that NHS Health Scotland published cites much evidence of that.</p><p>I will focus on another of Shiona Baird's points, which was about the involvement of non-perpetrating men and boys in challenging and changing our society's attitudes. I will relate a <place-holder colnum=\"11623\"/> story about a family I know. Many years ago, the mother was called to jury duty. The defendant in the case was a victim who fought back after years of abuse. The case affected the juror deeply and sometime later she discussed with her family the issue and the impact that the case had on her. It was the first time that her young sons had been aware of the issue of domestic abuse and it led directly to discussions in their primary school class, which was an opportunity for attitudes about gender, respect and violence to be raised sensitively. We obviously do not want to wait for everyone to be involved in jury duty, but that case shows that we need to find innovative ways to involve boys in particular but also men who oppose domestic violence to challenge the underlying attitudes.</p><p>Donald Gorrie mentioned alcohol. It is important to address that issue as alcohol can be a trigger for domestic abuse and can make individual incidents more likely to occur. However, we must keep our eye on the ball when it comes to the underlying social attitudes that cause domestic abuse.</p><p>I am sorry that I do not have enough time to cover many of the points that I intended to raise. However, I particularly want to mention Cathy Peattie's passionate and valuable speech and should say that Maureen Macmillan's account of the incident on the train added a valuable touch to the debate.</p><p>I close by referring to Mike Rumbles's usual point about male victims of domestic abuse, which on this occasion was echoed by Donald Gorrie. I do not think that there is any reason why we cannot do two things at once. Some victims take the difficult step of making a phone call to try to access services only to be told that nothing can be done to help them or, worse still, that they are not the victims of real domestic abuse. However, there is no reason why we cannot address that issue while acknowledging that the overwhelming number of people affected by this problem are women who are victims of violence by men. The problem is by its very nature gender-based.</p><p>This topic has been addressed before and will no doubt be addressed again. We must continue to do so because the underlying problems and attitudes have not gone away.</p>", "hdate": "2004-11-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13326566", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Domestic Abuse"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I thank all the contributors for what I think has been a valuable rehearsal of the arguments on this important topic.

We can endorse the minister's comments on community ownership, but we agree with Elaine Smith that transfers should be proposed without strings attached. In general, there is much to be proud of in the Executive's record on housing, but big problems nonetheless remain. Fuel poverty is decreasing, but it is subject to the whims of fuel prices due to the lack of progress on reducing the need for energy consumption though increased energy efficiency. Targets are being set for the supply of new affordable homes, but there remains a steady drain on homes for social rent through right to buy, and home ownership is still promoted as a social aspiration in a way that does not happen in every other European country. As a result, the right to rent is being steadily lost.</p><p>As WWF Scotland has made clear, and as my colleague Shiona Baird highlighted, housing contributes to the problem of Scotland's ecological footprint, which is appallingly high; I argue that the social footprint is also too high. Homes that are below tolerable standard are still in use and development is skewed towards the luxury end of the market. I could give many examples of that from Glasgow, but I am afraid that I do not have time. The overall situation in Scotland is one of rising levels of home ownership and rising <place-holder colnum=\"11288\"/> property prices, but there has been a loss of rented stock and a consequent loss of expectation that anything other than home ownership can meet most people's aspirations.</p><p>I welcome what Christine Grahame said in her speech and can support, in general, what is contained in the SNP's amendment. Christine Grahame was the first to mention the right to rent in this debate. The right to rent cannot exist as a mere principle; the homes have to be there and they should not be only the most basic homes but ones that people want to live in. Without that availability, the principle is meaningless. Earlier this year, I became a first-time buyer when&#8212;due to the quite comfortable salary that I have acquired&#8212;I moved from a tiny, freezing-cold room-and-kitchen into a comfortable, centrally heated flat. However, the home was what I wanted, not the tenure; I wanted a place to live, not mortgages and solicitors' fees. I suspect that many people of my generation want the same as me and would be happy&#8212;as I would be&#8212;to rent that flat from a social landlord or a similar source.</p>", "hdate": "2004-10-28", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13325476", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Housing"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will do my best to remain within my time, Presiding Officer.

At most of the hustings that I attended and in most of the media coverage that I saw, whenever the economy was mentioned, every party bar the Greens talked about the need for GDP growth and about how Scotland performs. At one hustings, which was organised by Scottish Environment LINK, every party joined us in calling for a sophisticated analysis of growth and for a recognition that there are downsides to growth and that we need new measurements of economic activity. In short, every party knew that the audience would not swallow the growth stuff, so instead of discussing how to grow Scotland's economy, they joined us in talking about whether we need growth and about how much and what kind of growth we need. They talked about economic development rather than economic obesity. Today, Jim Wallace stood up and told us that what is required from politicians is a consistent response. I agree. The Green response is certainly consistent, and it is distinctive. I will make the case that it is also irresistibly credible.</p><p>However, first I will consider the motion and the amendments. The Executive's position displays glaring inconsistencies, if we want to hand on a better Scotland in relation to transport, renewables, waste, housing and aviation&#8212;I mention aviation in particular. Several members have referred to Tony Blair's speech on climate change. It is not possible to take seriously the local, national or global impacts of climate change while wanting to grow ever more aviation. The contradiction between an obsession with GDP growth and the social and environmental aspirations that we must prioritise drives through all the Executive's inconsistencies. Instead of a focus on those aspirations, there are a few decorative, green-thread policies&#8212;enough to allow ministers to say that they are doing something.</p><p>I agree with the Scottish National Party that the Scottish Parliament could do more if it had more powers. That is undeniable. In an independent Scotland, we would have our hands on more of the levers of power. I support that, but what really matters are the hands that are on the levers and the controlling mind that is behind them. If the controlling mind remains obsessed with growth, nothing meaningful will change. I perceive no interest or advantage in swapping growth-obsessed government in London for growth-obsessed government in Scotland.<place-holder colnum=\"10269\"/></p><p>I was disappointed that the Scottish Socialist Party joined the SNP in calling for an economy that is based on oil. Public oil does not pollute the planet any less than private oil does.</p><p>There were few surprises in the Tory position. The main difference between the Tory growth addicts and the Executive growth addicts is that the Tories are a bit more ambitious about how they might find the cash to pay for the next fix.</p><p>Only the Green amendment recognises that growth carries social and environmental costs, acknowledges the inherent flaws in the old thinking and calls for the focus on GDP growth to be abandoned. Economic growth is irresponsible in the context of the vast majority of our environmental problems. It is utterly facile to try to solve those problems with the same mindset that caused them. The Executive is trapped in an economic orthodoxy and every other party, bar the Greens, seems to accept much of its agenda. We need to cast off those blinkers and seize the opportunities that an economy based on social and environmental justice would offer.</p><p>Economic growth is strongly linked to energy use. The obsession with growth feeds into ever-higher carbon emissions and ever-higher demand for energy that is derived principally from fossil fuels. We must break that link. The economy is inextricably linked to social and environmental issues and it is absurd to treat any of those matters in isolation, yet the Executive does exactly that, month after month and year after year.</p><p>GDP is useless as a measure of a sustainable economy. It measures the money that changes hands in the economy, whether that happens for good or ill. Money that is spent on cigarette advertising increases GDP as much as money that is spent on recycling does. Every car crash or family break-up contributes to GDP. GDP also ignores non-monetary transactions, such as the vital services in the home and in communities that form the social fabric of society. An increase in GDP might have some benefits in some aspects of the economy, but it also undermines and decreases the strength of our social fabric. We must ask ourselves whether we are heading in the right direction.</p><p>GDP also treats the depletion of natural resources as income: when parkland is tarmacked over to make a car park, that boosts GDP; and when old forest growth is cut for cheap timber, that boosts GDP too. Those events should be treated as depreciation; they should be in the debit column, not the credit column.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-16", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13322869", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Growing Scotland's Economy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I want to relate a little anecdote from the European elections, which took place earlier this year.

However, we must also consider our cultural need to reduce our focus on the acquisition of meaningless stuff in our lives.

It is beautiful and I like it a lot, but I feel a sense of responsibility. This room will ring with the voice of Scottish government for many generations to come; generations of Scottish politicians yet unborn will be here. The chamber should be a reminder to us all to hand on a better Scotland to them.</p><p>The Executive's programme has many elements to commend, some of which I will mention. The justice and communities portfolios look pretty busy. Members of the Parliament's smaller parties sometimes have to double up on portfolios&#8212;I am pleased that the Executive will be keeping me busy in the next year. Robin Harper's opening speech for the Greens had a strong emphasis on climate change and the Executive's failure to take on its responsibilities to provide a safer tomorrow for Scots and all the world's people. Despite the low aspirations at UK level on that issue, the Scottish Executive has fallen even shorter. However, I have always made the case that Green politics is about more than environmentalism and I will close for my party by setting out a response to the Executive's programme on other aspects of the quality of life in Scotland.</p><p>It is already becoming difficult to discuss charity reform without getting into debates over private education. It is clear that that issue will need to be addressed. The private, as opposed to public, benefit that is gained by exclusive fee-paying schools must be recognised and dealt with, but we must also take care not to endanger smaller, less wealthy schools, such as Steiner schools, which struggle to survive in order to provide a genuinely alternative approach to education. Such schools currently benefit from charitable status.</p><p>There is a great deal to commend the proposals on housing that we have heard today, such as the improvement of the private rented stock and the recognition of the huge shortfall in affordable housing. However, I point out a contradiction between two members who, I am afraid, have both left the chamber. John Home Robertson described&#8212;accurately, I believe&#8212;a housing crisis, whereas the First Minister, Jack McConnell, spoke of a housing renaissance as a result of the Executive's work since 1999. I wonder whether the Executive has the commitment to reverse the policies that have resulted, in Glasgow, for example, in a renaissance for luxury housing and huge developments with no affordable element. Prime sites are taken up with &#163;250,000 or <place-holder colnum=\"9968\"/> &#163;300,000 houses and the less prime sites are left for affordable housing, if we get round to building it.</p><p>There is little in the Executive's programme to support activities that turn residential areas into communities. We need not only housing, but local activities in all sectors of the economy. A town without a vibrant local high street is no town; it is Tesco town. A town with only the same big brand-name shops on its high street survives only at the whim of multinationals, whose decision to ship out and relocate will come as soon as there is a sniff of bigger profits elsewhere. Locally owned business, however, will stay and fight to make a go of it. The issue is even more important in some areas of our biggest cities, from which regeneration money can simply leak away if there is no truly local economy to soak it up and get it recirculating.</p><p>On justice, we have heard about many issues that we can welcome. We must all welcome what was said about the use of the internet for grooming children for abuse and I am sure that we will all welcome the opportunity to pass the bill. The same applies to what was said about female genital mutilation overseas. Many people have been waiting a long time for action to be taken in relation to family law and it is great to see the inclusion of a family law bill in the Executive's programme. I also welcome the restatement of the commitment to the children's hearings system and to the reduction of reoffending. I will enthusiastically endorse those elements if it looks as though they are heading in the right direction.</p><p>Jack McConnell mentioned reforming prisons, but he gave very little detail. Does reforming prisons mean that we will have more private prisons or does it mean that we will cut overcrowding in prisons? Does it mean ending short-term sentences? Does it mean ending slopping out? Does it mean recognising that prisoners are human beings with human rights?</p><p>Speaking of human rights, I should add that there was no word in the statement on the Executive's programme of the establishment of a Scottish commission on human rights. Getting that done and out of the way before Westminster creates the commission for equality and human rights would have real advantages and I ask the Executive to respond on that point in particular.</p><p>We have before us the programme that I expected. It contains generous scatterings of supportable measures and plenty of upbeat soundbites such as \"supporting excellence\", \"championing achievement\" and \"improving opportunities\". However, the underlying contradictions remain. The Executive wants sustainable integrated transport, but it has built capacity for ever more traffic. It wants <place-holder colnum=\"9969\"/> environmental justice, but it has planned for ever more waste dumps and incinerators. It wants affordable housing, but that is just not being built. It wants safer communities, but we hear no word about the youth work revival that many people want, believing that it could be one of the greatest preventers of the chaos that we work hard to combat in communities.</p><p>The final contradiction&#8212;the deeper one&#8212;is the one that Jim Wallace tried to deny. Greens are all too often accused of being anti-growth. However, what we want is a sophisticated understanding that not all growth is good. If we assume that all growth is good, we risk undermining our health, our environment, our social fabric, our freedom and our dignity. Only by accepting that quality-of-life measures are crucial to our assessment can we be sure of growing the right things and only an Executive guided by that wisdom will pass on a sustainable Scotland to the generations of unborn politicians who will speak in this chamber after us.</p>", "hdate": "2004-09-07", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13322157", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Scottish Executive's Programme"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "Members from all parties have talked of their feelings when speaking for the first time in this beautiful chamber.

When I was 11, I sat on the back of a van, hurling bundles of newspapers around Dumbarton. At the time, I thought that it was just good fun and did not think that it had any public benefit, but it was in fact the beginnings of a doorstep recycling scheme for the area. My parents and others in the community had organised the scheme back in the days when such issues were not even on the agenda of local authorities.</p><p>For many years, most domestic waste that was recycled in Scotland was collected by small voluntary organisations and through community effort. Those self-starting individual organisations led the way in finding solutions to problems that the private sector made worse and about which the public sector was not yet doing anything.</p><p>In the same area now, the voluntary sector recycling scheme provides training and employment to the community and a higher quality of environmental services than my local authority can manage. The social benefits of training for those who are trying to get back into work after long-term unemployment or illness are matched by the environmental benefits that the services can offer.</p><p>Years after my first voluntary role, I was living in Glasgow and I was harassed out of a flat by a landlord who, I am glad to say, will probably now fail the fit-and-proper person test. My parents told <place-holder colnum=\"9662\"/> me, \"Of course you can come back and live with us. You're our son and you're always welcome here. And you're going out to work on our new furniture recycling project.\" So I was back on a van, but this time, as I was a little bit older, I was humphing wardrobes around instead of bundles of newspapers. However, I was essentially doing the same thing as previously, which was diverting waste from landfills. We collected unwanted furniture and household goods from people who had no other intention than to put them in a skip and we distributed those goods to people who needed them. Anything that we could not use was disposed of as responsibly as we could manage.</p><p>We were constantly amazed by the amount of stuff that people put out: beds, sofas, washing machines, cookers&#8212;you name it. We were able to furnish an entire flat for many people at zero cost. All that was done from material that, as I said, would have ended up in a landfill site and all the work was achieved by volunteers. That project has gone on to achieve much more, including creating sustainable employment and increasing its range of services.</p><p>Meanwhile, I had moved on to other things: I was back in Glasgow working in the HIV field. I was in contact with a wide range of organisations that relied on volunteering, from my employer&#8212;who benefited from volunteers in office roles and in conducting sexual health outreach work on the commercial gay scene and in public sex environments&#8212;to community centres, arts organisations, youth groups and a host of other organisations and settings.</p><p>The Steve Retson Project was one of the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. It is a dedicated gay men's sexual health clinic within the national health service and not only provides services, but engages the community that it serves as volunteers to work in reception. The project aims to defuse the tension and anxiety that many people feel about accessing sexual health services and to create a friendly and welcoming environment. Volunteers have also taken part in conducting research among the target group, raising awareness of the service and designing the look and feel of the service and the marketing material. As members of the steering group, volunteers help to determine the direction that the work takes. At the beginning of September this year, I will be delighted to join the Steve Retson Project and its many staff and volunteers to celebrate its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p><p>Much of the work in the wider HIV field started as proactive community-driven health activism. It was creative and imaginative and it sometimes broke the rules, but it was free to do so because it involved volunteers acting on their own initiative. Little by little, that work has turned into public <place-holder colnum=\"9663\"/> services. Policy makers determine the priorities, but the voluntary sector delivers them&#8212;it is still doing excellent work and still innovating and getting results. However, in the move from health activism to voluntary sector service provision, perhaps something has understandably been lost. The retention of the proactive and energetic spirit of the volunteers whom we are celebrating requires the support of funding structures, but that is not always easy for big funding bodies to achieve.</p><p>Much like the concept of embracing diversity, celebrating volunteering is one of those aspirational things that we can all support, but it is sometimes easier said than done. I am sure that we will all mention many of the projects in our regions and constituencies and the work that is done by them. However, many of the projects will be experiencing difficulties in meeting the needs of volunteers and in supporting them. It is sometimes hard for organisations that live year to year on short-term funding to support volunteers. Many of them achieve impressive results, despite those problems. We should enthusiastically celebrate their work.</p><p>There is much to improve in the way that we treat voluntary organisations and in the resources that we make available to them, not just in funding, but in advice, training and simplified services to help them to access the other organisations with which they need to interact. Once we have got that right for small organisations, the volunteers will have much more to celebrate.</p>", "hdate": "2004-06-30", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "20158478", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Volunteering"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I will reminisce for a few moments about my first role as a volunteer.

The debate is surprisingly long and I hope that we all manage to keep going for the full day. The issue is important and I know that many organisations are keen to see us debate it properly. It is good to see that the review is taking place. Many of the organisations that I have been <place-holder colnum=\"8331\"/> in contact with are keen and enthusiastic about the review, which they believe is long overdue.</p><p>I am afraid that I will begin with a few criticisms before I move to something a little more positive. My first criticism relates to some of Donald Gorrie's comments on the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill. We have to look at the children's hearings system and the bill in concert, because they impact on one another in many ways.</p><p>My main criticism is that the review is happening after the bill. If the Scottish Executive wants to open up dialogue and think creatively about how we intervene in the lives of young people who are at risk of abuse or harm, or those who are likely to offend or who are offending&#8212;often they are the same young people&#8212;it is clear that the review should have preceded the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill. That applies not only to the review, but to reducing reoffending, alternatives to custody and a national youth work strategy. Those issues should have been considered first, because they are the supportive, creative and positive ways of addressing antisocial behaviour. If the Executive had done that, it would have been possible not just to create a better bill, but to gain broader support from the organisations that are criticising it.</p><p>My second criticism concerns public meetings. Members will know that it is not always easy to get wider participation in public meetings, but such meetings are an important aspect of the Executive's consultation on the review. I inform the minister that my office spoke to a member of a children's panel, whose day job involves working with a children's organisation, who found out about the discussion event in her city only two days before it took place. If people who work in the field are not aware that public debates and discussions are taking place, that calls into question the seriousness with which the debates are being promoted. Given that debate and consultation are part of the Scottish Parliament's and the Executive's process, we must do a little better.</p><p>My third criticism of the Executive concerns the leak to the press, which other members have mentioned. The floating in the media, a few days before this debate, of the concept that a punitive approach may be pursued through a separate system is not an acceptable way in which to conduct the exercise.</p>", "hdate": "2004-05-18", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13318195", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Children's Hearings"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I apologise to members for my late arrival to the debate.

The documents in the pack contain a lot of good stuff, such as the recognition that we need to improve links with communities and the sense of ownership that people have of the children's hearings system. I agree with Scott Barrie's comments about the concern that too much specialisation may mean that lay people come to be perceived as experts. I am glad that the issue of specialisation is raised in the consultation, but we must be cautious in considering it. The consultation also recognises that the wider family context of children who are in contact with the system must be taken into account and that young people should be involved in the work of the system. Of course, we also need to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. I am glad that we will have the opportunity to feed in to the debates on those important aspects.</p><p>Throughout Scotland, there are strong advocates of the principles and values on which the system is based. They include people who work within the system and others who work in a wide range of youth and community organisations. Robert Brown mentioned Fairbridge&#8212;recently I visited that organisation's Glasgow project and was impressed by its work, but it is only one of many such examples. I want to mention the dedicated and expert individuals who worked with NCH Scotland on the \"Where's Kilbrandon Now?\" report. I am sure that all members have read and taken seriously that report, which makes a valuable contribution to the debate.</p><p>The consultation recognises that the system is old, that it was designed for the 1970s and that much has changed since then. Politicians may blame one another for the dramatic increase in child poverty, but ultimately, we must all take responsibility for tackling it. The drug culture has developed and changed dramatically since those <place-holder colnum=\"8333\"/> days, although there have never been adequate services or humane policies on that issue. There has been a steady deterioration of communities, not only materially, but in human terms. As jobs, services and local life disappear, so does cohesiveness. There have been ever-increasing strains on public services such as social work and a deteriorating provision of youth work in many communities.</p><p>All those factors are root causes of both antisocial behaviour and some of the problems that the children's hearings system faces. Those few irresponsible politicians&#8212;I am glad that they are few&#8212;who advocate an ever-more authoritarian line, with the terms \"thugs\" and \"neds\" peppered throughout, have little to worry about, because at no level in society are the root causes of the problems being addressed.

Such an approach is so much more constructive than some people's attitudes to issues of offending. Even in parliamentary debates, the language used in relation to these issues is punctuated by mindless name-calling for the sake of a few cheap tabloid headlines.</p><p>We should welcome many of the ideas in the consultation. If they are followed to a logical conclusion, they will force a move away from the tough on crime side of Labour's old slogan and require more of a focus on causes. One of the most important elements is the emphasis on support for released prisoners. A great deal could be achieved if the Executive could ensure that all ex-prisoners had the help that they needed to build a stable life on their release. As the consultation points out, that means addressing issues such as accommodation, employment, health services and family ties. However, it also means less tangible concepts such as hope, self-respect and a respected place in wider society.</p><p>I also greatly welcome the goal of ensuring that Scottish society views prison as the ultimate sanction for the most serious offenders and people who pose an unacceptable risk. However, the endorsement of retribution as a purpose of the prison system is not to be welcomed.

Such a focus can lead to a sense that all we have to do is react to crime, rather than explore new and challenging ideas. It can also reinforce the notion of a clear division between victims and offenders. In reality, many of us are both victims and offenders at various points in our lives. Pauline McNeill's question in today's First Minister's question time on slopping out in prisons reminded me of that. It is too easy to decry the payment of compensation to prisoners by labelling them as convicted criminals. They are convicted criminals, of course, but they are also the victims of a human rights violation. It is their victimhood that demands compensation. Offenders and victims are not always separate groups in society. A recognition of that would help to promote serious consideration of what are complex issues.

Our thanks are due also to Glasgow's media. The letters page of <em>The Herald</em> has helped to keep the issue to the fore over the past few weeks and months.</p><p>Over the past year, since the election, many cases relating to the issue have come up in my mailbag and in my e-mail inbox. I am sure that that is true for other members as well. Even before the election, I was involved briefly in the Thornwood park campaign, which Sandra White mentioned. In fact, that might have been the first time that she and I met. I did not wear suits much in those days, so I do not know whether she recognises me from then. I was astonished and appalled by the arrogant way in which a vibrant, active group of local campaigners was treated. They made good use of their park, but their views were ignored. The developers showed virtually no willingness to engage with them. Why should they? They have a profit motive to consider. However, I heard deeply offensive comments from the developers about the local residents, which I suspect is typical of what happens in many cases.</p><p>Hogganfield, which is on the border with North Lanarkshire and is within Glasgow City Council's <place-holder colnum=\"7595\"/> area, has been described as a rich</p><p class=\"indent\">\"natural habitat for a ... variety of wildlife with the wooded area being home to deer, rabbits, foxes and endangered small bird species.\"</p><p>According to the environmental impact assessment for Hogganfield, the loss of the wildlife resource</p><p class=\"indent\">\"is a direct, irreversible impact but although the impact on the deer is high, the overall significance in terms of nature conservation is low as ... deer are not considered to be a valued resource for conservation.\"</p><p>It seems that quality of life for human beings in Glasgow is not particularly highly valued either.</p><p>Robert Brown mentioned the situation with Cathcart back park, which typifies what happens in a lot of places. A group of local people have ideas about what to use their park for and want to improve it so that it becomes a valued local asset. They have been hassling the council for a long time&#8212;years, in some cases&#8212;because their area has been neglected and has been allowed to fall steadily into a state of disrepair. At times, it seems almost as though there is a conspiracy. The worse we treat a piece of land and the more neglected it becomes, the less concerned and anxious people are to protect it, so that when a development is planned people have less enthusiasm to object.</p><p>What are the causes of the problem? According to Charlie Gordon, Glasgow needs a bigger middle class. He once explained that to me as his diagnosis of the only and most significant economic problem facing Glasgow. It is amazing how people speak to one differently when one does not wear a suit; put a suit on and they become more circumspect all of a sudden. As a result of the idea that Glasgow simply needs a bigger middle class, any postage-stamp-sized piece of land is sold off to build the housing to attract them, but there is not the environment to keep them there once they move in.</p><p>There is a pressing need for social housing. If that was what was being built, I would have to accept the need to free up land, although I would want brownfield and derelict land to be used. However, a lot of the luxury houses that are being built are out of even my price range as an MSP, as I found a few months ago when I was flat hunting. It is simply ridiculous that building luxury houses is our priority.</p><p>The loss of green space has consequences for health and physical activity. Duncan McNeil mentioned the health impact, especially in the context of the increasing obesity problem. He valiantly neglected to condemn Glasgow councillors in the same way as he condemned his own councillors.</p>", "hdate": "2004-04-21", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13316281", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Glasgow (Green Space and Leisure Facilities)"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, thank Robert Brown for bringing the debate to the chamber and I greatly appreciate the chance to speak in it.

It could take on more business and relieve the pressure on the sheriff court system.

The error is rather unfortunate and perhaps demonstrates the lack of understanding that exists about the issue. I am therefore grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue and I hope to explain clearly what the use of intermediaries is designed to achieve.</p><p>Intermediaries are not intended as a conduit for a witness's evidence; rather they are intended to protect from aggressive cross-examination child witnesses who may be traumatised or frightened in giving their evidence. Protection from such hostile cross-examination could prevent some of the most stressful and upsetting experiences that child witnesses have in court. Intermediaries would ensure that the substance of a question was preserved, but that inappropriate or aggressive language was removed. Questions would be put to a child witness in language that the child could understand and respond to so that they could give their best evidence.</p><p>I would like to read for the <em>Official Report</em> the experience of one young person, who said that a lawyer</p><p class=\"indent\">\"kept interrupting so I couldn't say what happened ... I could never finish my sentence ... I'd been big and brave enough to go to court, but I never got the opportunity to tell them what had happened. Child witnesses need to have the opportunity to tell their story to lawyers who can communicate with children. Children should be the priority.\"</p><p>Experience of the operation of an intermediary system comes from South Africa, where such a process has been in use for 10 years in an adversarial system of justice. Like Justice for Children, I believe that we should put such experience to use and make it available to the Scottish justice system. The Executive and all parties have accepted the principle of protection for child witnesses and other vulnerable witnesses and there are already examples in our system of people being questioned through, for example, an interpreter or a signer. The use of intermediaries for child witnesses would not contaminate evidence. Indeed, it would do quite the reverse; it would enable child witnesses to give their best evidence, which is one of the main reasons for the existence of the bill. The comparison that Justice for Children has made is that we would not send into an adult court a vulnerable child witness with a broken arm without getting medical treatment for the child.

We want a more satisfactory arrangement to be put in place before serious mistakes are made because of the extremely poor level of scrutiny that is possible at the moment. However, we do not oppose Sewel motions in principle. When we oppose them, we do so for specific reasons. I have three major areas of concern about the issue in the Sewel motion that is before us, two of which were mentioned earlier by Nicola Sturgeon. However, there are three aspects of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Bill that the Scottish Parliament should be able to examine in detail.</p><p>First, I want to deal with clause 7, which is about the removal of support from families with children. That is already a deeply disturbing issue in Glasgow and elsewhere. Scores of households are being turfed out on to the street with no form of support. In the jargon of the Home Office, they become non-returnables. However, we are talking not about empty bottles but about human beings with vulnerable families who are seeking help. We have a responsibility for them, but the bill will inflict destitution on more of those people. The welfare of children is a devolved issue and I believe that there is strong public support for the Scottish Parliament to take a humane approach to asylum seekers, who include people for whom protection from exploitation and trafficking is necessary. Therefore, we must consider the impact that the whole bill will have on such victims.</p><p>Secondly, I want to speak about clause 11, which Nicola Sturgeon also mentioned. Senior figures in the legal field have already raised their voices against clause 11, which removes the right of appeal from asylum seekers and gives the proposed asylum and immigration tribunal immunity from our courts. Given the shockingly poor record of decision making in asylum cases, it seems lunacy to allow our courts to be circumvented in that way.</p><p>Thirdly, I want to mention the impact that clause <place-holder colnum=\"5824\"/> 2 will have on the victims of trafficking. That was the main theme of an amendment that I had hoped to move in the debate. Clause 2 will create a new criminal offence of entering the country without valid immigration documents. That is something that would be true of the vast majority, if not all, the victims of trafficking. Again, ministers will no doubt argue that that is an immigration issue and is therefore reserved. However, surely the creation of a new criminal offence should at least be debated in the Scottish Parliament. Moreover, the potential impact of the creation of the new offence on victims of trafficking could be grave. Even if they were guaranteed immunity from prosecution for undocumented entry, many would be deterred from seeking support and protection from exploitation.</p><p>Therefore, the motion in front of us today examines only one tightly defined aspect of the bill. Until we have the opportunity to examine the bill's wider measures and to consider how they will impact on people in need of protection from trafficking and exploitation, I cannot support a Sewel motion on the bill. To do so would be to wash our hands of issues such as the welfare of children in Scotland, the role of the Scottish courts and the criminalisation of innocent people in Scotland. We can have no faith that the UK Government and its neutered Parliament will act in the best interests of the vulnerable in such issues. Their record on asylum seekers is one of authoritarianism and draconian treatment. The bill's wider measures are just the latest example of that. We cannot trust the UK Parliament or Government to act in the best interests of asylum seekers, so we cannot give them our consent to do so.</p>", "hdate": "2004-02-12", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13311409", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Bill"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "As I have said previously, the Scottish Green Party has serious concerns about the process of Sewel motions.

The assertion that the bill has something to do with same-sex relationships confirms the fact that misunderstandings have arisen.

I hope that we will not always use them, as I believe in independence, but in a devolved Parliament such as this, there is a place for the Sewel motion. However, the Sewel motion procedure that we have is wrong. It fails us and it fails those for whom we work.

I ask members to welcome to the gallery some of the members of the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on sexual health.</p><p>As I am sure I have mentioned before in the chamber, in the time that I spent working in the sexual health field it was not far off a national joke that we had no sexual health strategy for Scotland. It was long perceived as necessary and overdue, so it was terrific to see the strategy. Nobody in the field will argue that such a strategy is not needed. It is also welcome to hear today the Minister for Health and Community Care broadly endorse the strategy. Some of his words in a previous debate, when a statement was made on the publication of the strategy, were perhaps ill chosen; they gave people cause for concern that the minister was trying to distance himself from the strategy, but I am pleased that the language around that changed today.</p><p>However, there remain areas where there is a substantial need to improve on what we have before us. As I am sure many members will mention, the main issue is resources. There is a broad feeling in the field that that is a key issue. There must be a commitment early on to specific and substantial resources. There is also the issue of the interpretation of some aspects of the strategy. Much of the strategy requires interpretation by the reader. Although the strategy places items on the agenda, it fails to prioritise them and could occlude the way forward.</p><p>Perhaps the implementation of the strategy needs to take account of the specifics as well as the broad sweep. I will mention a few of the specifics then move on to some of the deeper-rooted issues. In particular, paragraph 4.20 places a requirement on national health service boards to work jointly with education departments, but the requirement is not reciprocal. I would be pleased to hear about any existing reciprocal requirements on education departments, but in the strategy as it stands the requirement is only in one direction, which could mean that successful joint working does not take place. There is also vagueness about how we should target specific groups, some of which have been mentioned. The field as a whole is aware that we have not quite got to grips with how we target the sexual health needs of, for example, older people, including newly single people.</p><p>The young remain an important target group <place-holder colnum=\"4764\"/> because if we can influence attitudes to sexual health and well-being from an early age we can make substantial and lasting progress. There is a lack of clarity over how we can ensure that all Scotland's young people, whatever school they go to, have their rights to sexual health and relationships education upheld, especially given that we have no single curriculum. Religious schools are not the only issue here, but they are an important issue, which it would be wrong to duck. For example, how can a Catholic education service ensure that its lesbian, gay and bisexual pupils are at no disadvantage in sexual health and relationships education if the discredited theory that homosexuality is a disorder continues to be promoted? I am not arguing that there is no possible solution, but I have to ask the question because the answers are not yet apparent.</p><p>Engaging parents is also important, as Shona Robison has mentioned, but I believe strongly that the approach promoted by the anti-sex education group Not With My Child must be challenged. This agenda must not come to be dominated by the tiny minority of parents who oppose sex education in principle. We must also challenge some of David Davidson's comments. Perhaps one of his party colleagues will at some point explain to us whether he would give parents the right to veto resources that endorse equality on that basis. We do not give parents the right to veto anti-racist material; why should we give parents the right to veto material that is anti other forms of equality?</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-14", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308752", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Sexual Health and Relationship Strategy"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, generally welcome the strategy and the debate.

A great deal is happening in the pipeline and the Executive has not had the arrogance to suggest that it is doing everything. More can be done and will be done in future.</p><p>I would like to mention some of the previous speakers' comments, in which the seriousness of the problem of youth crime and young offenders for communities was recognised. It has also been acknowledged that there are no easy answers. However, a couple of times in today's debate we have already heard the old chestnut about the need to be tough. It is always easier to say that word than to define what it means. Giving young offenders the opportunity and motivation to re-evaluate their lives can be a tough process. Challenging behaviour and facing people with the consequences of their behaviour can be tough. Too often, the word is used to indulge the unsavoury attitudes and co-opt the support of people whose instincts are more akin to those of the hang-'em-and-flog-'em brigade.</p><p>We should consider the motion and ask ourselves what it says to us. The title mentions a \"Quick, Effective Youth Justice System\", and no one could disagree that a youth justice system should be quick and effective. The text includes the word \"firmly\", which reminds me of the word \"tough\". I am not quite sure what \"firmly\" means and I wonder whether it has been chosen for the same reasons that \"tough\" is sometimes chosen.</p><p>A more fitting aspiration for our youth justice system is compassion. We in Scotland should be proud to have developed a system that has compassion at its heart and which places the needs of young people at the centre of the process. That is, of course, the strength of the children's hearings system. It has the capacity to be flexible, innovative and responsive to communities, and it involves people who are passionate about protecting the welfare and rights <place-holder colnum=\"4611\"/> of children while challenging unacceptable behaviour. Other members have acknowledged that. I echo Margaret Smith's comments and praise for the people who are involved in running the children's hearings system.</p><p>Yesterday, the Communities Committee took evidence on the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill and heard representatives of the children's hearings system speak highly of the fast-track pilot. However, they also asked us to consider why there should be talk of a fast track. Why should there be a slow track? Why should young people who are in need of the compassionate justice that the children's hearings system can provide have to wait months or longer? The minister's earlier comments about increasing the number of cases that go through a fast-track process are therefore welcome. It will be interesting to hear more about how that will be implemented.</p><p>A review of the children's hearings system is in the pipeline. The Scottish Children's Reporter Administration has welcomed that review. If it is handled well, the review process could lead to a newly invigorated confidence in the system, a wider awareness of what it does and what its successes are, and a new commitment to the principles of compassionate justice. When I look at the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill, one of the questions that I have to ask myself is why some of the measures in it are being considered at all. In particular, I ask myself why they are being introduced before the review of the children's hearings system has taken place. Some of those measures include moving children out of the children's hearings system into the court system&#8212;I refer to the granting of antisocial behaviour orders for under-16s through the court system rather than through the children's hearings system.</p><p>Giving registered social landlords the power to apply for ASBOs against children is another concern. Ministers have repeatedly asserted that ASBOs for under-16s will be used only for a small number of persistent offenders. Those young people are already known, and will be known, to the children's hearings system. Where is the need for another way of identifying them or targeting them through giving RSLs the opportunity to apply for ASBOs against them? I do not intend to criticise registered social landlords or undermine their important role. It is a question of whether the children's hearings system is already the appropriate context.</p>", "hdate": "2004-01-08", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13308349", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Youth Justice"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I, too, welcome today's debate.

However, it is sad that, as far as I am aware, only four home zones are being piloted in Scotland; we really want to see that moved on.</p><p>Turning streets into valuable public spaces that are an asset, rather than just gaps between buildings, involves a mixture of legal and physical barriers, sanctions or interventions, such as traffic-calming measures, trees and bushes, seating or <place-holder colnum=\"4286\"/> play areas and clear signage. In Glasgow, too many of our small parks and play areas are being swallowed up by housing developments, all of which add more car parking spaces. Streets that are already congested are getting worse. I hope and trust that the Executive will take the benefits of home zones seriously.</p><p>We have to consider other issues&#8212;not only to do with how we design our streets and urban communities, or to do with zones and speed limits, but to do with traffic levels. We have continually talked about the demand for traffic reduction targets. By 2020, Glasgow will have seen a 40 per cent increase in road traffic levels, according to the Scottish Executive's figures. That increase is bigger than the Scottish Executive's own \"do nothing\" model. Despite all the interventions, developments, changes and policies that the Executive is bringing in, we are seeing a bigger increase in road traffic. That will inevitably mean a higher incidence of road accidents, whatever the speed limits and whatever the urban design. If we want to reduce road traffic deaths by 2010, we will have to consider where we will be by 2020, when the streets will be far busier. People have to have genuine choices. If the roads are still busy, or if they are perceived to be unsafe, people will still get in their cars to take the kids to school. If it is cars that cause the danger and the fear, we need to change the culture. That will never be easy, but the only way to guarantee that we fail to achieve it will be not to try to achieve it.</p><p>There is an implicit admission in Glasgow City Council's welcome and positive step: road traffic dangers must be addressed.

We hope that, by making the experience of going to trial less traumatic for some individuals, we will improve people's access to justice&#8212;or rather, remove some barriers to justice.</p><p>As we remove those barriers, should we not stop, think and ask ourselves why they exist in the first place? Why should systems and institutions whose purpose is justice depend for their operation on environments and processes that inflict such trauma on people? Such conditions are not conducive to justice. Improving access to justice should not be interpreted simply as being about improving access to the justice system.</p><p>The Executive has also made commitments to restorative justice.

In many&#8212;perhaps most&#8212;situations, courts will still need to impose solutions on individuals who are unwilling, for a range of reasons, to deal with one another through the processes that I have described. However, we could provide many people with an opportunity to avoid experiences that are stressful, expensive, long-drawn-out and emotionally draining for all concerned.</p><p>I want to talk about the situation of organisations, especially small voluntary organisations with limited resources, when they encounter the court system or other situations in which they need legal advice, information and representation. My experiences along those lines relate to the campaign against the repeal of section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986. During the campaign, a single action against Glasgow City Council, which led to a judicial review, resulted in the suspension of funding to a wide range of organisations from youth groups to telephone helplines, arts organisations and essential support services for people living with HIV. In the end, the action against the council was dropped within hours of the first day of the judicial review, but that was long enough to affect many small, unstaffed, unfunded organisations seriously and to prevent people working for the larger organisations from focusing on their work for weeks on end in what was already a difficult time.</p><p>Voluntary organisations can face that kind of situation not just in such politically sensitive, high-profile situations, but in property, employment, copyright and planning cases. Planning presents particular problems, given that the planning system is stacked overwhelmingly against objectors. The small campaign groups that form, most often to make an attempt at community self-defence, are normally not well resourced and have little or no access to legal advice, information and representation. Those factors combine to deny them access to justice or just outcomes. I hope that the Executive will acknowledge in its review of the planning system that the same enthusiasm for changing culture and modernising and improving access to legal advice is needed there, too.

As the newly published draft sexual health and relationships strategy makes clear, sexual health is not merely an absence of disease; rather, it includes social, emotional, physical and mental elements of well-being in relation to sex and sexuality. That holistic understanding was central <place-holder colnum=\"3815\"/> to our work. I pay tribute to the organisation that I worked for, PHACE Scotland&#8212;Promoting Health and Challenging Exclusion&#8212;which still works hard and effectively on those issues.</p><p>World AIDS day always had an important place on our calendar. It was an opportunity to use methods&#8212;such as advertising, news coverage and television programmes&#8212;that were not always available to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. We went out and did street stalls, put up posters and had social events. Many of those methods will be familiar to politicians from across the spectrum. World AIDS day gave us an opportunity to reach people who we often did not reach at other times and to celebrate the lives and work of people in the HIV field, including those who were overcoming difficulties caused either by living with HIV or by the discrimination and prejudice that they faced because of their HIV status.</p><p>In recent years, one of the most predictable headlines around the time of world AIDS day was about heterosexually acquired HIV. Our job was continually to remind Scotland&#8212;the Scottish public and Scottish policymakers&#8212;that HIV prevalence among gay and bisexual men is still high and rising. Gay and bisexual men are still a key target group and a group that has never received a proportionate allocation of health promotion funding to reflect that prevalence. Funding should be available not only for specific health promotion projects, but to build equality and diversity training into all services and to tackle homophobia at root. That includes work in schools.</p><p>There is a need for other work that is targeted at men who have sex with men, who may not be gay or bisexual. That includes condom provision in prisons and I am glad that some progress may be made on that shortly. We must also give the same high priority to support services and interventions for men selling sex as we do for women.</p><p>During my time working in the field, the proactive health activism that initiated gay and bisexual men's sexual health work largely gave way to a perception of voluntary organisations that were service providers for the statutory sector. Among the consequences of that change are insecure one-year funding and project funding without core funding. That has practical and emotional consequences for the people who work in the field. Tireless efforts are being made by hardworking, talented and professional individuals.</p><p>I have lodged a motion to bring to the attention of members the misinformation about sexual health that is spread around the world by several organisations. That issue is controversial because one of those organisations is a church, which spreads misinformation about the effectiveness of condoms as part of a sexual health strategy. That happens not only in developing countries, but has <place-holder colnum=\"3816\"/> happened&#8212;and probably still happens&#8212;in Scotland. I have encountered it myself.

In the previous financial year, the Women's Aid group in Glasgow received from women 974 requests for refuge and was able to accommodate only 247 of those. The picture is equally stark nationally&#8212;it seems that barely a quarter of the required places exist.</p><p>The funding for Scottish Women's Aid that was announced yesterday is welcome, but we have been told that it will allow the organisation only to meet existing staff costs, including wage rises&#8212;it will not allow Scottish Women's Aid to increase capacity. There remain areas where greater clarity could be provided. I hope that we will hear more about those when the Deputy Minister for Communities sums up.</p><p>The minister's comments on training are particularly welcome. It is important for staff in social work, the justice system, the police and health services to have access to specific training <place-holder colnum=\"3719\"/> on the issues that will face them when supporting victims of gender-based violence, domestic violence or rape and sexual abuse. That would be of enormous benefit.</p><p>There have been calls for changes to the legal system. Nicola Sturgeon's call for independent legal representation for complainers has real potential and I hope that it will be considered. The suggested pilot scheme on domestic abuse courts sounds innovative and positive, but could it not be extended to deal with rape and sexual assault cases in which the offence is not perpetrated by a partner or ex-partner? Mary Mulligan has said of the courts pilots:</p><p class=\"indent\">\"I am convinced that this will ensure a fairer and more accessible system of justice for the victims of domestic abuse.\"</p><p>Surely the courts could provide the same benefits for victims of rape and sexual abuse that is not domestic abuse. I understand that the domestic abuse strategy will not address the situation of the victim to whom Helen Eadie referred, who reported that she had been raped at a party; it will help only those people against whom the offence was committed by a partner or ex-partner.</p><p>Annabel Goldie called for tougher court sentences.

Because of those advantages, objectors in Crown planning cases will not get a fair crack of the whip. I would like to outline briefly the circumstances in which those Crown advantages will apply.</p><p>In cases in which it is believed by Scottish ministers or the Secretary of State for Scotland that disclosure would compromise national security, planning inquiries that would otherwise have been held in public will take place behind closed doors. That will limit the ability of objectors to make their cases. The proposal to allow the Lord Advocate to appoint a special advocate to represent the interests of individuals will not make <place-holder colnum=\"3539\"/> up for that disadvantage.

In such cases, the local authority will be bypassed; the application will go directly to Scottish ministers. The skipping of a stage in the normal planning process will put objectors at a time disadvantage.</p><p>Enforcement is my third concern. The Crown's exemption from prosecution is to be maintained, and courts will be unable to deal with problems of enforcement. As enforcement is such a perennial problem in private planning cases, with work being done without planning permission or outwith the terms of a successful application, objectors can often lose all confidence in the planning system. Enforcement is a crucial issue that should be addressed.</p><p>There are, of course, enormous problems with the planning system in general; the Executive agrees with that, having made a commitment to reform it during this session of Parliament. When that time comes, we will argue that the presumption in favour of development should be replaced by a presumption in favour only of sustainable development.

Opportunities to do that will arise during the bill's progress through Parliament.</p><p>There is a strong case for including in the definition of vulnerable witnesses complainers in specific cases, such as sexual offence cases, because we are all aware that people's fears and anxieties about the courtroom experience often deter them from proceeding with a case or even from reporting their experiences to the police. That argument has not yet been drawn out. We are all aware of the low reporting rates of some serious sexual offences. Perhaps that means that the category of offence could make a stronger case than a witness's age alone for granting an automatic right to special measures.</p><p>As Stewart Maxwell said, the differences in maturity among many people at different ages show that there is not necessarily a single cut-off point and that we should not base automatic status on age alone if we are not willing to base it on categories of offence alone. As James Douglas-Hamilton has said, the situation is different in England and Wales, where the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 ensures that automatic access to special measures is based on categories of offence.</p><p>Like Rape Crisis Scotland, I am concerned that the role of supporters could be spelled out more clearly, particularly in relation to the physical <place-holder colnum=\"3370\"/> accommodation that could be required in a courtroom. If we can agree on the use of supporters&#8212;I am sure that we can&#8212;it is bizarre that a court might not even ensure that supporters are visible to witnesses while they give evidence. If reassurance could be given that that has been addressed, I would welcome it. If not, I hope that an attempt will be made to deal with that during the bill's progress through Parliament.</p><p>I was dismayed to read that, in civil cases, the party that cites a witness will bear the cost of any measures that are required. I hope that such a principle would not extend to charging for loop systems or lifts to be installed, for signing or for other measures that are required to overcome barriers for disabled people. The measures for vulnerable witnesses should be regarded in the same light and costs should be met as a matter of course.</p><p>Perhaps, in the long run, the same approach could be taken to special measures for vulnerable witnesses as we expect organisations to take for granted when it comes to disability discrimination. We expect organisations to be prepared routinely to cope with a wide range of access requirements and a wide range of people. We expect organisations to make reasonable adjustments&#8212;indeed, we do not expect that; we require it in law.</p><p>Surely all witnesses should be asked, as a matter of routine when they come to give evidence, what their requirements are. Should their wishes not be respected? Surely our courts should expect to encounter continually a wide range of people with a wide range of requirements in relation both to physical access and to the special measures that we are discussing today. I hope that some of those issues can be addressed during the progress of the bill.</p><p>I also hope that other issues will be addressed, including training for the people who work with children, young people and other vulnerable witnesses in the justice system, and the age limit for automatic vulnerable witness status, which is set at 16 instead of 18.

That trend must be reversed. Also, the Executive must <place-holder colnum=\"2910\"/> refuse to accept the suggestion that car use and civil aviation must grow and grow. Those are the two fastest-growing sources of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the country, and the Executive's ambition to create a 40 per cent increase in road traffic in Glasgow will mean disaster for Glaswegians and the rest of the planet's inhabitants.</p><p>I will be glad to welcome a new commitment, if it is to come, to embracing sustainability in the Executive's transport policy&#8212;even if the ministers will not look at me while I am speaking. The Scottish Executive could demonstrate that commitment by showing the same urgency in expanding concessionary and free travel schemes that it shows in relation to proposals for putting electronic tags on children; by reversing the trend of providing cheap road and air travel; by investing not only in big-budget mega-projects, but&#8212;as Pauline McNeill said&#8212;in bus services, as our European neighbours do; and by prioritising and funding urban planning and design policies that will make our towns and cities safe and pleasant environments in which to walk and cycle.</p><p>Even Brian Adam suggested that the Executive has much to boast about concerning its development of cycling routes. However, rather than giving glowing praise for a limited number of specific routes, I ask the Executive to focus on the daily concerns that cyclists cope with on our roads throughout the country. I want the Executive to tackle congestion, lane priorities, dedicated signalling and other measures as a matter of course, not just on a limited number of routes. Until we see that new, sustainable approach, I will still have to reply to letters and e-mails from disgruntled cycle commuters who are trying to get into Glasgow city centre in a nightmarish winter rush hour&#8212;or at any other time&#8212;and taking their lives in their hands. Although there have been some signs of progress, there is still a feeling in Scottish Executive documents that cycling is a pastime&#8212;a hobbyist's weekend excursion that takes place at least a train ride from the city.</p><p>Other commitments that we could see from the Executive include a social justice audit of all transport funding and the Executive throwing its weight more fully and comprehensively behind Glasgow's crossrail scheme and projects like it. Most important&#8212;I have mentioned this before in the chamber and members will be bored of it, but I will not stop mentioning it&#8212;the Executive should swallow its pride and accept the fact that the &#163;500 million M74 northern extension project is a scandalous policy to pursue. It is in direct conflict with the interests of Glasgow's southsiders; it is defended by arbitrary job creation statistics; it will increase road traffic and pollution; and it will degrade the environment locally and globally. It must be scrapped. Iain Smith's call for the Greens to be more constructive in this transport debate <place-holder colnum=\"2911\"/> can elicit only one response&#8212;it depends on what is being constructed. If the Liberal Democrats want to feel more comfortable in their green threads, they should join me in opposing that appalling urban motorway project.</p><p>Many members have talked about integration, regulation, strategic planning and investment. All those measures are important, but, to be frank, I do not care whether the Scottish Executive delivers them under the present arrangements or through a new agency; I care about putting sustainability at the heart of transport policy.

We need those forms of sustainable transport to be right at the heart of transport policy, not just squeezed in between the gaps in the traffic.</p><p>Many members have mentioned jobs. We must look to protect local businesses and to invest in public transport, community-owned renewables, community recycling and other social enterprises. All those green alternatives create more jobs than the grey policies that they would replace.</p><p>Although we support the attempt to take an holistic approach to urban development, there is something lacking at its heart.

The Green party broadly supports the idea that local decision making should be introduced.<place-holder colnum=\"1774\"/></p><p>I understand the importance of the points that Pauline McNeill made, but the impact of the proposals will be that Glasgow City Council will be the level at which decisions that affect Glasgow will be made. I make a plea that there are issues in smaller districts, local communities and even at street level that must be taken on board. Consultation must be meaningful. Far too often, consultation is simply a box-ticking or rubber-stamping exercise that people think that they must go through. Consultation is difficult, but it must be meaningful.</p><p>The impact of drinking on local communities and streets goes beyond the more obvious signs of public disorder and drunkenness that we see too often and that I have certainly seen in my street. That impact includes noise pollution, which has health implications. Broken glass, litter and discarded bottles, for example, can be left in the streets. We must find meaningful ways in which to engage with affected communities.</p><p>One factor that can distinguish between a responsible and orderly establishment and other establishments is the extent to which the establishment's roots are in the community that it serves. A perception that I have of Glasgow is that chain pubs and megapubs are too often the focus for the problems that are identified in the Nicholson committee's report. I searched that report for recommendations relating to protecting and supporting establishments that have their roots in local communities and are owned by local people, but did not find anything. I hope that I will have enough time to continue hunting in the report. I would like that issue to be debated as the report is acted on.</p><p>The licensing principles that the report describes are sound, but I am unclear about the practical implications, which need to be spelt out in more detail. If the terms of a licence can be altered because a business has been found to be operating outwith the licensing principles, businesses need to know exactly what is required of them in order to uphold the principles. To be realistic, a pub will never become a health-promotion project. To what extent should we enforce requirements such as the provision of seating, the constant availability of food, minimum ranges of non-alcoholic drinks or price differentials between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks? I have found that orange juice is more expensive than alcohol in most pubs. To what extent should we enforce requirements for noise levels and smoking? I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss related issues in a member's bill at some point.</p><p>We have heard a little about enforcement. Christine Grahame and, previously, Donald Gorrie have mentioned several regulations that are not <place-holder colnum=\"1775\"/> enforced, which can lead to disorder and other problems. The minister has argued that compliance can be achieved by education. I support that approach in the first instance, but we must not return to the Parliament in the years following the implementation of the recommendations to argue that we are seeing no evidence of compliance on the ground.</p><p>Many members have discussed our drinking culture. Culture can take a long time to change, and laws, regulations, guidelines and strategies can go only so far. Educating staff who serve alcohol, and young people in schools and youth projects will certainly help, but there is immense pressure on young people to indulge to excess in a drinking culture that our media continually portray as sexy and enticing. I do not have simple answers, but I fear that we will not change our drinking culture much unless we engage with our culture's mass media.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-17", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13301221", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Licensing Laws"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I join other members in welcoming the opportunity to debate the Nicholson committee report.

The debate is long overdue in the Parliament.</p><p>In general, the Scottish Green Party's policy on immigration and asylum recognises that countries <place-holder colnum=\"1603\"/> such as the UK have significant responsibilities for the root causes of people from many parts of the world needing asylum. We bear a moral duty to those people. We should be happy to welcome them, whether they choose to stay here only until their home countries are safe again or whether they choose to make a new life and home here and contribute to our culture and society. On that basis, we support the statement from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that persons under the age of 18 should not be detained. We give our whole-hearted support to that position and the current operation at Dungavel is, therefore, to be condemned.</p><p>I had hoped to lodge a more constructive amendment that would have added to the SNP's position, recognising that voluntary organisations, churches and individuals throughout Scotland are already working&#8212;often quietly, of their own accord and without recognition&#8212;to support refugees and asylum seekers. The capacity exists among such organisations to provide an alternative that is superior in every regard, and they recognise the benefits that can come to cities such as Glasgow. New life and energy are put into schools when asylum seekers' children participate. New life and energy are put into voluntary organisations when asylum seekers choose to volunteer, broadening the scope and depth of understanding of different experiences of life that our voluntary organisations can gather. Those benefits should be welcomed and encouraged.</p><p>We must decide which, if any, of the amendments that are before us improves on an already strong and clear motion. Annabel Goldie's amendment correctly identities an inadequate and ineffectual policy on asylum, but I doubt that her idea of an adequate and effective policy would be similar to mine. To offer profound regrets without suggesting solutions or ideas is, itself, inadequate.</p><p>Robert Brown's amendment certainly contains a lot more material than the motion; however, that is not a real advantage. The amendment's reference to the reports by HM inspectorate of prisons and HM Inspectorate of Education is welcome. However, as we have heard, the ministers of the Scottish Executive&#8212;who can take no action or even express a view on reserved matters&#8212;have been holding secret talks to address the concerns that are raised in those reports. Robert Brown's amendment also refers to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, that perspective is implicit in the motion's call for a simple end to the detention. That is, as I have mentioned, the UNHCR's position and that of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. Robert Brown's admission that he regards the taking of a moral stance as a knee-jerk reaction dismayed me, and I hope that he will find time to reflect on his speech later. Finally, the convoluted call for action by Her <place-holder colnum=\"1604\"/> Majesty's Government at the end of his amendment fails to express the strength of the views, feelings and wishes of members from many parties.</p><p>That leaves Elaine Smith's amendment, which at least addresses the issue&#8212;the detention of children. The amendment also refers to the families of such children. We would not, of course, support the separation of children from their families as part of an asylum policy. I think that the call for the Executive to engage in communications to seek an end to the practice is not an improvement on a call for an end to the practice. However, I am ambivalent about supporting Elaine Smith's amendment. I will listen to other speeches.

The same things are said time and again: that we must make national and local organisations work together; that we must build skills and confidence; and that we should work together better and build a shared vision. It seemed that every time I turned a page, I was being promised the goods, with phrases such as \"delivering change\", \"how we will work\", \"making change happen\", \"our action plan\" and \"implementing our action plan\", but I never quite got to the goods.</p><p>I read the startling revelation that people in deprived communities are less likely to have resources and learned that</p><p class=\"indent\">\"The role of the social economy ... is in social and economic issues.\"</p><p>If communities are really going to be brought in and made the main partner in the community planning process that has been promised to deliver services, all of us must look more closely at how to communicate ideas. After the commitment <place-holder colnum=\"1374\"/> to do less, better, perhaps we need a commitment to write less but mean more.</p><p>There are strongly and passionately held views in the chamber and no member takes poverty lightly. It is a shame that people watching this debate might see it as just a slanging match between opposing sides. There are genuine opportunities to use the Scottish Parliament's current powers to make a difference and there are untested proposals and ideas that we would try in Scotland if we had the powers to do so.</p><p>As I have only a few minutes, I do not have time to focus on everything. However, I will briefly consider transport, employment and health and then say something about a Green Party proposal.</p><p>On transport, around &#163;1 billion has been committed to investment in road building. Margaret Curran and I represent a city in which 60 per cent of households do not have access to a car. We are looking at a 40 per cent increase in traffic congestion in that city. Such a situation has many consequences&#8212;air pollution, stress for drivers and lack of exercise, as healthy forms of transport, such as walking and cycling, become unbearable. There should be some objectives or indicators&#8212;to use the language that is used in reports&#8212;relating to the number of bus routes to deprived communities, traffic reduction, especially in residential areas, and the relative costs of public and private transport. In real terms, public transport has become steadily more expensive during my lifetime whereas the cost of driving has stayed pretty much the same.</p><p>On employment, we need to protect local jobs and services. The documents that I have read recognise that need, but far too many jobs and services are still lost to out-of-town supermarkets and shopping centres, which in turn increases the need to travel. The quality jobs that hold communities together are often lost. We cannot just</p><p class=\"indent\">\"make communities more attractive for business\"</p><p>and solve the problem, as one report suggests. We need to give real advantages to local firms through the planning system and in public procurement. As Donald Gorrie said, we need to seize on huge opportunities from co-operatives and the social economy. We should consider the number of local jobs, rates of pay in local communities and survival rates for small businesses.</p><p>I have a background in using social and educational approaches to try to improve health and am aware of the difficulties in achieving such improvement in a society that actively undermines health. I have talked about air pollution and dangerous, oppressive and unattractive public spaces. Every bus shelter is plastered with adverts <place-holder colnum=\"1375\"/> for high-fat, high-sugar foods. The Executive has recognised the implications for communities in which the only business might be the local off-licence. Too often, that business is joined by a chippie and a video shop, which does not have the makings of a healthy night in. We should consider local food supplies, diet, air quality and the number and quality of public spaces, play spaces and parks within walking distance for children in local communities.</p><p>One of the untested solutions that we could use if we had full parliamentary powers is the citizens income scheme. Many Green parties throughout the world are in favour of such a scheme, which is about getting resources directly to the communities that need them. The scheme is a redistributive policy that would increase the social participation of people who cannot take part in employment or volunteering opportunities, or who find it difficult to balance employment and volunteering with caring for others. Such a scheme would be a relatively simple change to make if the powers that currently exist at Westminster were used. A few steps over a number of years would be needed, but it would recognise our mutual dependence on the ecological and economic systems that sustain us all. It would do away with the false division between those who are perceived to take from the benefits system and those who are perceived to give to the state through tax. The scheme would recognise that we must share this world and its wealth.</p>", "hdate": "2003-09-04", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13300160", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Closing the Opportunity Gap"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "While doing my background reading for this debate, I was struck repeatedly by the language of the various reports on poverty, social inclusion, regeneration and community planning.

I also welcome many of the provisions that are contained in the white paper on modernising justice, which are designed to relieve some of the problems that are experienced in administering the justice system and in protecting the people who come into contact with it as defendants, witnesses or victims.</p><p>The consequences of the problems are far from trivial. I know that members of all parties take the problems very seriously. All of us, including the newcomers in the short time that we have been in the Parliament, have had contact with people who have been aggrieved by their experiences of the justice system. All of us are aware of the damage that can be done to communities in cases of failures of justice.</p><p>I welcome in particular the measures that are designed to prevent the harrowing experiences of some victims and witnesses, which can leave them feeling intimidated, upset and traumatised. Measures that seek to ensure that a trial occurs at a time and date that are fixed in advance will help to reduce the personal insecurity that can for many people precede a trial. Although we share some of the reservations that have been expressed about the changes to the time limits, we recognise that the certainty that a trial will take place on a fixed date and time, if that can be achieved in the majority of cases, might outweigh those concerns.</p><p>I have to admit that I would have preferred to see early progress on some of the more visionary aspects of the Executive's programme, such as its commitment on restorative justice. Over the <place-holder colnum=\"1074\"/> course of this session of Parliament, I hope to see developments that recognise the benefits to offenders, victims and communities that could come from making restorative justice, as opposed to punitive justice, our priority.</p><p>I also hope that there will be a recognition that prevention is always better than cure. I believe that that applies every bit as much to crime as it does to health. Colin Fox mentioned measures to reduce the role of alcohol and drugs in crimes of disorder. I hope to see the introduction of those measures. I also hope to see the widespread provision of mediation services to families, neighbours and communities in order to prevent problems from escalating, and I want more conflict resolution education in our schools. Those and other measures would go some way to addressing the longer-term issues that create the problems that the Executive hopes to solve.</p><p>I also look forward to the consultation paper on antisocial behaviour, which the minister mentioned and which will be published tomorrow. I look forward to it in the sincere hope that it will allay the worst fears that many people&#8212;me included&#8212;held during the election campaign about knee-jerk reactions and tough-talk posturing on crime.

It makes a change from seeing the almost daily media portrayals of young people as dangerous, feckless or reckless. I worry that, over the coming months, the Parliament will add to that portrayal by focusing so heavily on antisocial behaviour orders. The bill on <place-holder colnum=\"452\"/> that matter will be aimed almost entirely at young people, despite the fact that young people are by no means the only ones who engage in antisocial behaviour.</p><p>My own experience of youth work was that it was a challenging and rewarding period of my life. The concerns of the young people with whom I worked covered the whole range of issues. The young people showed the dynamism and individuality to which the motion refers.</p><p>However, for the young people with whom I worked, school, far from being a place of safety and learning, was a hostile and violent environment. Many of them had left the education system early or had barely participated in it because of the discrimination and prejudice that they faced daily. Most had not been given the information and support that they needed to protect their health, with sexual morality often used as an excuse. Like all young people, they left school in the knowledge that they would not be entitled to the same minimum wage as the rest of us. Entry to further or higher education could saddle them with daunting levels of debt.</p><p>The sport and recreation facilities to which the motion refers are obviously welcome but, in a society that structures its transport needs around the car, young people's access to facilities is a crucial issue. Far too many young people are left dependent on lifts&#8212;a perk that can be given or taken away.</p><p>For those for whom the home environment was not safe, the prospects were even more grim. With no automatic right to social housing, they could be exploited by private landlords or by those who were only too eager to offer accommodation with their own sinister interests at heart. Many of those who had been in the care of local authorities had life histories that should make Scotland ashamed. Passed from pillar to post and abused, unsupported and criminalised, they were young people for whom violence and exploitation were a part of daily existence.</p><p>As Johann Lamont mentioned, to say that is not to criticise those who are working to offer support to young people. Scotland has many dedicated and hard-working professionals working to combat those problems. However, far too many of them are stressed out and overworked because of understaffing. As a result, many young people will fail to meet the potential to which the motion refers, unless vital public services receive increased funding.</p><p>As for enabling young people to participate in society&#8212;another of the motion's aspirations&#8212;there are increasing opportunities for them to do so, as long as they do not want to do so inside this chamber, and as long as they do not want to affect <place-holder colnum=\"453\"/> the decisions made in the chamber by voting. To keep the bar on democratic participation at 18 is not defensible. The arguments have been well rehearsed. Young people work, pay tax, receive services, have families and are bound by the laws that the Parliament passes. They should have the right to tell us what to do and to sack us if we ignore them.</p><p>The motion contains aspirations that we can all support, but for too many young people in Scotland, those aspirations are not and will not be met.</p>", "hdate": "2003-06-05", "major": "7", "subsection_id": "13297525", "parent": {"body": "Scottish Parliament: Young People"}, "video_status": "0", "extract": "I welcome the opportunity to use my first speech in the chamber to discuss a motion that mentions young people in such a positive light.
